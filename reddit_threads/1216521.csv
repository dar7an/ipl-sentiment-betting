Here's hoping we play the same line-up as we did against SRH but have Uthappa open and Stokes at 5. The pitch was slow yesterday so it probably will be today as well so Unadkat will benefit from that.,8
"I want RR to win this year just because of Tewatia. But seriously the top order has to click sometime now, its been collapsing for 4-5 games in a row.",18
Why does Vohra find himself out of the team? Royals have a potentially deep batting line up so surely they would prefer a dasher up top rather than an accumulator. Uthappa is a very decent backup accumulator imo but surely team dynamics dictate that Vohra is more suited to the role needed with smith taking over the accumulator's role?,3
"With pant out and hetmyer sacrificing for carey as the only wk option, DC batting is fucked. Too many accumulators at top 3 - dhawan, rahane,iyer. I think they need to play stoinis/carey up the order to avoid last match mistake.",2
"It looks like the whole concept of ""mid-season transfer"" is going to fall flat on its face.",7
"Ideally should have been an easy win, this pitch has also slowed down over the tournament which will let Dhawan and Carey really flourish here.

Iyer should come at 4/5 this time.

Shaw Dhawan Rahane Carey can build an excellent innings on a slow pitch.

Iyer to accelerate

Stoinis, Axar, Harshal to finish.

Bowling is great no changes. Will be interesting.",4
"If Tewatia has another match winning performance, do y'all think he will be popping up in the national selector's radar for at least T20I, especially in overseas conditions where pitches are more fast bowling friendly & teams typically play with one main spinner?

I mean he's basically fighting for a spot with Kedar Jadhav, Washington Sundar, Krunal Pandya etc.",12
"Life is so fucked man.

Rr is getting fucked by the top teams

And I m getting fucked by the exams üòî",8
"Bc pant lifting kaif and dancing, real injury or ponting mind games? Lol",18
"Butler

Uthappa

Smith

Samson

Parag

Stokes

Tevatia

Archer

Gopal

Tyagi

Unadkat

This should be the ideal 11. No more opening with Stokes and play Uthappa on top ffs",11
"Haven't seen a good innings from Buttler in so long. Missed the year he had 5 50s, hes pretty average in tests and had a mild af world cup. Where the fuck is the cleanest hitter since AB I was promised ffs?",8
"Rabada has the Purple Cap but Bowling MVP for me is Nortje, guy has been top top notch",7
If RR is smart they will bat first if they win the toss. Dhawan and Rahane will eat up all the balls and there‚Äôs no Pant or Hetmeyer. 170 would be a winning total on this ground,8
mankadjokes loading,4
Backing RR to continue their form here. Lords confidence is sky high,9
"I want RR to win now more than ever. Jersey arrived from IND just yesterday and the missus (she's American) thinks ""sanitary napkins"" on the back of a shirt is just hilarious.

She gets the seriousness of it, but just can't stop laughing.

Fucking yanks!",48
"Stay alert...Stay tuned everybody...
**its Match Day for Wannabe Champions**üñ§",-6
That pitch does look like a bit dry. I wonder who plays well today.,3
Just saw Pant warming up. Man that's not chonky... That's proper big unit physique,6
"Really hope the royals win today, Sanju Samson really needs to start scoring again",6
"How many times have we even lost the toss, gotta capitalize on this luck boys lezzgoo",7
"Incase, Pant doesn't play i'd like to see, Lalit in place of Rahane and Tushar in place of Harshal.

I'm not convinced with Rahane as a floater and Harshal doesn't take any wickets",6
"DC win toss, congrats DC on winning",10
"Bit harsh on Harshal, Here's hoping Tushar has a great Debut!",5
Lmao Ben will open again? Bruh,13
"Rajsthan Royals have been fully utilizing their *Random Openers Generator Technology* so far in this IPL:

Jaiswal, Smith

Buttler, Smith

Buttler, Jaiswal

Buttler, Stokes

Stay tuned.",63
Mumbai Lad Tushar Deshpande making his debut! Good bowler but he tends to bowl no balls.,9
"err got no hope for today really, just hoping to see a stokes special. or another tewatia, either will do",6
[removed],4
Big game for Skokesy,9
Pant r/absoluteunit,5
"Pant lost a heck lot of a weight between the time of his debut and pre-lockdown, but looks like he's back to square one now. Just saw him running during the warmup and man, in his training kit, he does look like an uncle. 

He definitely needs to take his fitness seriously, I wonder how much of him being not so fit attributed to his injury. Especially being a keeper, he's gonna pick up a lot of injuries if he doesn't get his fitness on track.",7
No Hetmeyer wtf,6
Pant is just another Finch in terms of fitness,8
"Without Harshal, DD's lower middle order weakens even more. If RR manages to take early wickets & puts pressure on the middle order, they definitely have a good chance of winning",5
"Okay. Here's the thing. Pant, despite his physique, actually takes singles and doubles. Especially when batting with Iyer. Still an absolute unit though. But as long as he performs, I'm good.",8
"I was really optimistic for today. Safe to say it's all ruined. You play a fucking opener at 5 and play a number 5 in the opening slot?

Jeez it's a fucking 11 man puzzle and you have all the pieces and you know their place yet you still continue with the idiocracy. Fuck you RR management, just fuck you.",22
"Robin Uthappa is a natural opener. 
Ben Stokes is a natural number 4/5. 
Rajasthan are struggling to find a stable partner for Buttler and a senior presence in the middle-order. 

They can solve all their problems in one go by opening with Uthappa and playing Stokes in the middle but nahhhhh, let's open with Stokes cuz why not.",10
"You can understand why North Indians are so thick. I mean just look at their cuisine, Butter Chicken, Chole Bhature, Kababs who can blame them? üòã",10
"Obviously hoping for a DC win to hold onto the sliver of hope I have for SRH to qualify. If RR lose this and KKR lose against MI, it‚Äôll be a 4-way race for the 4th spot to qualify. If the top-3 continue to dominate then the 4th spot might go to a team with 6 or 7 wins like in 2018 and 2019.",6
"Help me complete IPL 2020 Thicc - XI

Rohit

Finch

Shaw

Watson

Pant

Hetmyer 

Pollard

Chawla",9
"Here's the problem with DD's batting without Pant and Hetmyer: 

Dhawan - Accumulator who can't score quick 
Shaw  - Dasher who rarely bats long 

Rahane - Accumulator who can't score quick 

Iyer - Accumulator who can score quick, but often fails to make starts count 

Stoinis - Perfect fit; ideal finisher 

Carey - Not a great T20 finisher, can do a decent job nevertheless. 

Without Pant and Hetmyer, there's so much pressure on Stoinis to click. If he doesn't click, they might be hovering around the 160 mark game after game after game unless one of their Top 5 overperforms. IMO Iyer should ditch responsibility and go all out like he used to do a few seasons ago. There's no point in him playing anchor because there's already two guys above him who can do that. If Iyer also plays anchor, I'm afraid DC will struggle in most games to bat opponents out of the game.",2
"DC batting first => DC winning :(

Chasing has been next to impossible this IPL",2
Amazing how losing just one player(Pant) can fuck up the entire team lineup. Such is the nature of this tournament lol,13
"Hetti not playing so send Carey above Stoinis. Probably at 3, Iyer at 4, Stoinis at 5 and Rahane as a floater.",2
4 Mumbaikars are in DC lineup today. I wonder if even MI have ever fielded such a Mumbai-filled lineup.,2
Unpopular opinion. Nortje better than Rabada this year.,8
Styris accidentally said Deccan Chargers lmao,8
"Delhi Capitals (Playing XI): Prithvi Shaw, Shikhar Dhawan, Ajinkya Rahane, Shreyas Iyer(c), Marcus Stoinis, Alex Carey(w), Axar Patel, Ravichandran Ashwin, Tushar Deshpande, Kagiso Rabada, Anrich Nortje

Rajasthan Royals (Playing XI): Lord Tewatia and 10 others",72
pant and hetmyer chest bump has to be the best highlight of this ipl.,2
"I've had a really hard day today, hope they'll do something to cheer me up",6
"It's been such a journey for Mayank Markande. Started 2019 IPL as MI's first preferred spinner. Then was pushed to bench by Chahar, got to play for India once, got traded to Delhi during off season who immediately traded him to RR, and is now not even getting a single game. 

Gopal and Tewatia are deservingly playing ahead of him. But just wondering what a roller coaster ride he's having...",11
"If that lineup comes like that, we dont stand a chance",1
Dugout is gonna be lit today!,1
Don't know much about Tushar but KP said he bowls fast. Fast is good.,7
hope steve smith surprises us today with a decent performance but I wouldn‚Äôt count on it,6
All I want in life is for our top 4 batsman to go for at least 30 runs each,2
"RR fans dont watch this match, we are gonna get fucked today.",3
Brave of Delhi to bat first against a team with the GOAT chaser (Lord Tewatia),4
Lord Tewatia in specs looks such a stud üòç,6
Damn the pitch looks like an ashtray,5
"When RR sees an English cricketer "" is he an opener"". If archer is not careful, he will be opening in the next match",8
Hello boys and girls.,7
Archer cannot even bowl length balls to shaw.,4
125 career SR as an opener is just sad tbh.,2
"I don't ask for much in this life. All I'd like today is a Jofra Archer 5fer, a 45 ball hundred from Buttler and cameo 50s from Stokes and Smith.

I hope Smith drop down to bat after Samson at 2 down. He's not needed in top 3 in this team. He's the best to the play anchor role in our middle order. He batting in the top 3 is ruining our whole batting order.,4

Pant's absence has already taken a toll on DC's team balance,2
"Pant > Hetmyer > Carey > Rahane

Delhi have to persist with Carey and Rahane just because Pant got injured. Should have selected a reserve Indian keeper",2
Will let Archer live with me in a cabin for a weekend,3
Rahane's role should have been a collapse preventer but he currently is a collapse initiator,7
I hope Tyagi bowls next,1
"Archer's last 4 deliveries -

Balls - 4

Wickets - 0

Lmfao! And they call him a good bowler.",9
So last ipl season for rahane?,5
Lol classic dc... letting me down slowly,4
"Jofra Archer 2 - 0 - 5 - 2

Love to see that!",5
"Two kinds of GOATs

Ones like KP and Warne who just chat shit.

Then the likes of Lara and Lee who are genius analysts.",21
Thoughts on someone like Iyer/Gill replacing Rahane in the upcoming test series against Australia? Rahane has been disappointing in last 2-3 years,2
"Big brain Smith, please let Archer bowl another over.",7
"Rahane when a bowler is bowling pies: *defends*

One of the best bowlers in the world in midst of a great spell: *slogs*",60
Gold chain probably reduces 5 kmph,6
Bold prediction:.DC and CSK will end with the same record by the end of the tournament,4
My mom's here trying to calculate weight of Archer's chain lol,69
Rahane to end up as a free agent in the mid season transfer window,15
I thought test cricket was done for the year,10
DC getting back in orignal form,8
Uthappa only in the side because he can do archer's hair,8
Thala Rahane proved his loyalty to RR with a classic 2(9),8
"Jofra is incredible he has conceded 5 runs from 2 overs and 3 of those are wides , and taken two wickets.",7
Rahane and Uthappa having worst of the seasons.,2
Waiting for Tyagi's famed outswinging short ball,2
"You non-Brits might not know this, but there is a Lord Jeffrey Archer who sits in the upper chamber. He's a bit of a prick. 

I maintain we replace him with the real Lord JOFRA Archer.",17
please have a slip for Iyer,2
Just goes on to show how crucial pant is to DC,9
"Losing Pant really fucked Delhi wow

^also ^lol",6
"Shaw is such a free wicket lol

And now he will hurt us good in the field as well.",8
As a big Rahane fan this hurts :(,5
Fuck I missed the first bowled of Earthboy. DC is under pump.,1
"If RR win today and RCB tomorrow, I'll start rooting for a complete turnover (where the results of all the first legs get reversed in the second leg, and everyone ends up at 7 wins and 7 losses)

Even tho that means supporting KKR against my team MI and so on",2
India Kya engineer see bhara para hai?,8
I will not raise my hopes till i see RR bat and not lose more than 2 wickets in the PP,9
It‚Äôs very possible that RR makes the kind of comeback that Mumbai does every year. They have an excellent team. Smith has to find his mojo and Samson has to find some consistency,9
Is this thread playing a shitpost gimmick or...,2
Jof's strength is all in that gold chain. DC just need to make him take it off,3
Loving how KG and Jofra are lighting up the tournament,3
Iyer wanted to see that sexy Cred dance,3
"Archer blasting 140+ almost every ball with those chains, imagine how fast will it go without the weight of those chains",8
Rahane or Dhoni? Who would you trust in T20?,3
Capitals going back to Daredevils,9
"Bro these CRED videos of ""happy"" fans are fucking hilarious.

Half of them look like they're being held on gunpoint.",40
"4 Mumbai players in the DC lineup today - Rahane, Shaw, Iyer and Deshpande",7
The DC/DD we all know pre 2018,3
What's Tushar Deshpande's pace?,1
Good bouncer but wrong line,7
I like this dhawan so much more,5
Finally 'Intent' from Dhawan,1
Typical dhawan shot.,2
Dhawan is the best stabilizer Delhi has,2
I think DC needs to score some runs now if they want to win.,2
G A B B A R,4
So are they gonna bowl stokes or not today?,1
"Guys why would you bowl to dhawan around the wicket, take advantage of the awkward position he gets in where there a gap bw his bat and pads",1
"What's with the cinematic shots they're throwing in here and there lol?


Live sports looks shite in 24fps.",1
Rr has the most op 4 overseas players on paper,7
Why would be bowl that line if he has no fielder there,0
Prithvi Shaw the next Tendulkar but with a 100 0s,4
"I may not show it but I absolutely cream my pants with the thought of having Archer, Bumrah, Rabada & Cummins in one IPL franchise.",4
 What's wrong with opening with your best batsmen rather than pretend to be strengthening your middle order when your best batsmen face barely 10ish deliveries? Ex: Stokes at RR this year. Don't understand the flak their management is getting.,0
"Archer has 15 balls over 150kph this ipl, next best is 5 from nortje",10
Hear me out guys: TukTuk Iyer is from Thailand,8
Dhawan batting is oddly more satisfying than other batsman of his class. Might be because he is a left handed strokes man,3
"""What we've seen from Unadkat and Tyagi is that they've gone for runs"". Thanks Tubbs",3
"Upvote the Match thread guys, so it's easier to find",9
Akash Chopra akela commentary kar raha hai.,2

Dhawan: *hooks it for SIX*

Aakash Chopra: I am gonna end this man's career hehe",6
"I really hope Stokes does well this time around. He hasn't done jackshit in the last 2 seasons, inspite of being in the form of his life in international cricket.",3
Hey Guys! I am new here. Can anyone please guide me as to how can I add flair?,1

Man I feel fucking bummed out for Rahane,6
"Ah, Koach's favourite player coming in to bowl",5
Ah sweeeet shot,1
"It isn't even close how much Rajasthan have the best overseas starters in the league. Arched, Smith, Butler, Stokes is unfair. However, half of him leave in normal seasons so it evens out",3
"This is a conservative decision for sure. RR have enough bowlers to finish out the 20, if it even gets to that. Jofra would've taken 4 and the innings would've been practically over by the end of the 7th",2
Yes dhawan prove your detractors wrong,3
Dhawan clearly read the match thread last time,13
"Irfan Pathan is becoming Aakash Chopra 2.0

Unpopular opinion: Sanju Manju wasn't that bad,5

"Dhawan's looking good, Shreyas needs to pick up the pace.",3

Daily reminder that it genuinely astounds me that Mark Nicholas still gets comms work. Diabolical,2
Oh bhenchod,2
Jeez that siren!... Scared the fk out of me.,8
Thats harsh,2
Watch Dhawan take a beautiful single.,9
that air horn was louder than usual.. or maybe I‚Äôm just upset,10

Can any believer here offer guesses as to why the Lord wears the sunhat at night?,8
Just me or was that blatantly not a no ball...?,6
Shaw looks traumatized,4
Is Strokes a good T20 player ? I always feel he is extremely overrated because of few good innings.,6
Ben Stokes providing much needed runs.,6
"Shaw is depressed because ponting already glared at him last match, this time if he fucks once more prithvi gonna feel an earthquake",4
no ball call was too harsh,6
"As an RR fan, genuinely scared of these two players in the crease. Dhawan and Iyer can demolish any bowling lineup",6

Pointing really blasted Dhawan for not showing intent against mi,2

Dhawan looks like he means business,3
He probably read our comments about his slow batting lol,2

Dhawan started where he left in the last match,2
Is that the least number of balls Dhawan ever took to reach 30?,1
Tyagi being economical for DC,5
"There‚Äôs such an advantage for a bowler even occasionally crossing 140 km/h. If the bowler‚Äôs range is 125-135, then the batsman can easily predict the reaction time required to play a shot. However if the bowler‚Äôs range is 125-143, those fractions of a second of less reaction time can really create doubt in a batsman‚Äôs mind. Having a well disguised slower ball creates similar doubt.",3
"Did Dhawan read last DC vs MI match thread, he is literally going at every ball",10
Let's hope he doesn't go too high and keeps going for 4s. Play aggressive but risk free cricket.,3

Archer's hard work is successfully ruined,5
yee Shiky bhai!,2
Rajasthan must be delighted that Dhawan has faced just 14 of the 36 balls,5
God I love swanny,4
One of the major problems RR have been having with their bowling is that Shreyas Gopal has been shit so far this season. Hardly any wickets and going for plenty of runs.,6
that polo shirt‚Äôs pretty sweet,2
Dhawan has switched from MRF to Kookaburra. Has to be the first Indian I‚Äôve seen with that brand. Soon he‚Äôll be playing ashes cricket for Australia,15

I love Swann lmaoo he's a fucking joker,39
Good recovery DC,3

"shreyas ""strike rotation expert"" iyer.",3
The battle of the Shreyases,4
It was damn time that Shikhar came back to form,2
Swann has self depreciating humour. Gotta love the lad.,6
Ravichandran Ashwin used to bat at no 3 during his stint at Punjab lmao.,6
"206, I'm calling it",4
Graeme Swann is an entertaining salesman.,10
"Lose two wickets in the PP

DC fans: is the dream over for us?

DC: still ends up with a RR of 8 at the end PP",10
Just one player gets injured and the whole side loses balance. Bloody diabolical,5
Iyer not even putting bad balls away today. Looks totally out of touch,3
Iyer is Gopal's bunny yikes,2
Why did DC stop using that üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà jersey? It was way cooler,7
What's the deal with Swann and Altroz car. He gets orgasm every time the car is shown.,11
Iyer remove your cap and activate beast mode pls,5
"Hah. Shreyas v shreyas, nice observation from Mark",4
"still remember bmac broke the car in 2015 wc,hope someone does it this year.",9
Iyer removes his mask to reveal it was Maxwell all along.,12
"""Free hit"" is a bullshit innovation in a game that already favours batsmen. To know that you can do pretty much whatever you want and suffer close to zeros consequences is, dare I say it, ""not cricket""


2 run penalty at max?

... maybe it all evens out in the end, so there is that, I suppose.",17
Too many teams are winning batting first this tournament. Any score above 170 and it feels like the target is not chaseable.,4
"Dhawan finds his touch half way through the season, happened last year too.",5
"Watched some RR training videos today. Doesn‚Äôt look like some of the Indian chaps know any English at all. Has to be tough to communicate as a foreign captain! Smith is already kind of an average skipper, makes it extra hard",11
Rajasthan and Mumbai have both caught DC with their Pant down,56
The Lord hath arrived,14
All hail the Lord,3
Swann finally got the rr tshirt,3
Who TF really wants to drive an Altroz,3
Lord is into the attack,3

RR won't be able to chase anything above 150ish,3
It would be awesome if Amitabh actually commentated in the IPL.,-1
Altroz is for people who want an alto but have shit taste,8
That ACKO ad was racist as fck. Crows cawing when the black man speaks smh,9
Tewatia should be upgraded to God. Lord level is so beneath him,4
Anyone else annoyed how Iyer doesn't always wear his helmet? Makes me nervous,3
Daily reminder that Kamran Akmal has won the IPL more times than Virat Kohli.,34
Looks like Swann is going to adopt Tewatia when season ends.,11
2nd half of IPL always more enjoyable thanks to relatively lower scores and wondering if it‚Äôs enough or not to defend,5
"That ""Halla Bol"" shit is annoying",6
What's with all the hate for Altroz? Looks like an alright car to me.,12
Dhawan bullying a teenager,8
Lord T and Archer are the biggest threats,3
What team do you guys want to join the most?,1
"""One of those cricketers with a happy knack of things happening around him""

"Swann: Stoinis, my all-rounder of the IPL so far 

Tewatia: bitch",8
"When I first ever time saw Tewatia, I thought Shami grew hair all the sudden.",10
Is there any sponsor for 6s this year?,6
Phew!!,1
You know crowd sounds are fake when you hear halla bol this loud. Rajasthan won't get this kind of reception even in Jaipur.,44
Another display of shitty fielding,1
Just look at the dots,1
Jofra is a class apart man. Hope he stays fit and not overworked throughout his career,8

Doesn't feel right that match is gonna be decided by who the won toss.,7
"Samson got bad form?? Don't worry, the lord will curse him even more cuz if that fielding",2
I know it‚Äôs hard but fielders just fall diving trying to stop a ball like that and failing is fucking hilarious to me.,3
"Fucking samson, fear the wrath of Lord",6
Samson did the right thing in going for catch rather than stopping the boundary,9
Samson clearly nervous after dropping a catch off the Lord's bowling.,2
Can't believe Sanju let that go,1
LORD is the only player who is batsman all-rounder and the same time bowler all-rounder.,3
What happened to Iyer's exaggerated trigger movement? Anyone else remembers?,3
Lord Sanju,3
Dhawan looking positive today,4
Dhawan pulling off a dual match tewatia..,6
Jesus the angle of turn is just ridiculous. Gopal is good,1
jofra's stats right now are godly,3
Team failing Lord again!!!,2
Close... Little less timing on it saved him,2
Dhawan this is UAE not England. How're you this high today,6
Why tf did I leave Dhawan out of my Fantasy team again,9

only rajasthan can manage to squander away starts like today's.,11
Rahane was well liked until he played lmao you either die a hero or blah blah blah,9
Daddy Dhawan,6
Is this a different pitch from yesterday's?,8
Delhi motoring along now. Anything above 160 would be a winning total given the pitch slows down and the quality of the DC bowling attack.,6
"Swann already hyping something special at the end of the over.....

It's gonna be the Ceat Tyres ‚Ñ¢ strategic timeout lol",13
Imagine having Archer and Rashid Khan on the same team that would be cool wouldn't it!,12
Are there actually this many 2s in this ground or is it just Dhawan and Iyer making it look easy?,3
I love that each team plays 14 games. You can see players and teams ebb and flow through their forms as the tournament progresses.,5

Last 3 overs only 1 dot ball.,5
Dhawan and Iyer exchanged bodies. No way Iyer is this timid against spinners,13
Cricket would have been something else if IPL and T20 format was present in the mid 90s.,9
None of the teams even care about this shitty commercial timeout.,0
Shaw was clean bowled and didn't do the 'oopsy the ball stayed low' gesture Sachin used to do. Kid has a lot to learn,11
Maybe that's why some Delhi fans enjoy when Shaw gets out.,3
Lara is giving a masterclass in dugout,2
Lol did Kaif always used to chew gum or is he doing it to copy Ricky?,2
Was a hindu; saw the Lord play for RR; the lord is my saviour now,5
stokes the imposter,1
"Only 57% for the lord


Outrageous",3
Listening to the dugout for the first time. Sanjay Bangar sounds like all the joy of his life has been sucked out and Swann is definitely high.,4
Stokes‚Äô hair look majestic af now.,3
Did Archer really do a Bihu dance? Anybody got a link?,1
Totally not biased but I say Stoin,1
Vijay Dahiya looks like he gives business idea pitches in the timeout and everyone tells him to shut up,1
Robert Cassell looks like Ryan Gosling imo.,3
Cesc Fabregas bowling coach of RR it seems,0
"How's this all time foreigners IPL XI

 Bruh there was a fan with MI poster in the back. Somebody tell him it's the wrong match,2
That poll shows why polls are bulllshit lol,6
They're just playing Rahane cos he was paid 4 Crores. Imagine trading Tewatia and Markande for him. Ffs. We've been played.,1
Random lol,2
Didn't know ben Affleck was coaching Rajasthan.,1
Stokes does not bowl good enough for t20. Rather have tom curran or oshane thomas to support archer.,1
"I'm watching the game to get a peek at the Altroz. Guys like us don't get talked about enough, we lose friends because we can't stop talking about this awesome hatchback, my wife has asked me to stop mentioning its safety rating during sex, but I persist. We exist guys, honour our fandom",6
Trading Lord Tewetia for Rahane smh. Worst trade deal in the history of trade deals.,8
Stoinis is better but whatever,3
Stokes and No ball. Name a better duo,4
If no fucks given was a shot and posture after the shot,4
Bruh. He just swatted the ball away like a fly,5
Damn those extras,2
abbey ben stokes,4
Hurts seeing Stokes get sent to the cleaners,3
Rahane is fine but only one between him or Shaw should play if Dhawan is fit.,1
Stokes is so shit in t20s,2
Stokes is still very rusty,1
Wtf was that shot? Ja bc bhut hua?,6
100 sr for Iyer yayyyy,4
Why does it feel like Stokes ain't trying much? Felt it last match too.,9
Given the WAY DC are going rn they might end up chasing 170 odd minimum. RR will really need someone from their top order to play through the innings. If they are to depend on Tewatia to bail them out every time they might as well bid farewell to their playoff chances.,2
What. I thought it would land on Iyers head. How did it clear the boundary,6
Dhawan SR thou üî•,7
What recovery from DC,6
How does Joffre share a dressing room w Smith for 3 months and then give him concussions during test cricket with absolutely no fuckin hesitation,10
Fucking fielding sloppier than a mf,3
Close to our customary run out per innings!,6
Stokes and Tyagi have single handedly fucked up the good work done by all the others with some real garbage bowling. Ffs.,6
"Frenship ended with Stokes, Curran is my best fren now.",17
That would‚Äôve been out,3
that's the second half chance off dhawan,3
came here to say that no ball sound is Fucking terrible and it raped my ears,5
"Whats with iyer?

He doesnt look at the ball if its perfectly timed. IDK not a captain material",-3
Stokes is actually  a mediocre white ball bowler,3
"Iyer:25 for 25



Dhawan:44 for 25",5
RR's fielding is shite,4
Anybody here really expected for Stokes to come and start bowling well immediately?,4
Look tewatia is super talented and all but saying he has been the better all rounder than stoinis is just not true lmao,14
"Same shit different day. Archer pick 1 or 2 wickets, rest of the shits just go through the motions and lose all advantage.",9
That interview felt like they would fire him if he said anything wrong lol.,4
Is there a chance that RR and KXIP both qualify with DC and RCB... Fuck no what am I asking.,8
People shitting on Iyer- he is still DC's leading run getter this season,9
"DC treating Stokes like a 7th bowler, deservedly",12
Bruh this boring ass interview with the bowling coach is upstaging a couple great minutes of action!!,23
[deleted],2
"DC is absolute control.
No way they are losing this.",8
I feel jealous of RR fielding. They have already saved 12-15 runs.,3
Gayle vs rcb tmrw,7
trash bowling from stokes. noball/free hit in both overs.,4
"RR's head coach andrew mcdonald played for rcb and was terrible. Their bowling coach is a debutant. Their batting coach is a meh. No wonder RR has no direction. Among all the overprised overseas players, tewatia is shinning.",5
People thought Stokes would bail RR out but he has always blown hot and cold in the IPL. He is one of the best all rounders of the contemporary era but hasn't been able to replicate that consistency in the IPL,8
Imagine having Stokes and Archer in your squad and you are still the best all-rounder this season for RR. All hail Lord Tewatia.,9
"Tbf to Ben he wasn't fit to bowl even when he was last with the England squad so his bowling will be rusty, but that being said this is some real shite",8
"In IPL, I would prefer Krunal Pandya over Stokes, 

both - in terms of batting as well as bowling",6
"If Braithwaite's final over happened today it would have been termed as ""doing a Tewatia"". 

I can't believe how much of a one hit(or rather, 4 hit) wonder he was.",10
"Done well to maintain the power play runrate in overs 7,8,9,10. Something we've struggled to do all tournament.",6
"RR's jersey looks like gelusil antacid bottle.

Lord will chance the game in this over,3
BC attack don‚Äôt play defensive till the 15th over and make fifth bowler look like world beaters!,2
Please don't bowl Unadkat. I'd rather see Smith's ugly bowling action,2
There's a wholesome video on the internet where stoinis and zampa have their nails painted and they show it on cam. Watch it when you're down,2
Shikhar reminding me of his test debut,2
27 from 27 yikes,2
Anyone else remember how shit KP was in IPL,4
"Stokes just looks forlorn. Something doesn't seem right about him. Surely the things back at home are disturbing him and you can very obviously see it in his face. I feel for him, nothing else.",4
So good to see Dhawan back in form :),7
Stokes was mvp in 2017 for rps but has had 2 stinkers in last 2 years for rr. This year looks like the hattrick.,3
Stokes is still in Quarantine mood,3
Iyer should hit wicket asap.,-13
Dhawan and Shreyas switched souls.,5
Lord's mesmerizing hair when he strolls in to bowl,4
"Does tewatia really bowl this well or has he been given some undeserved respect by the batsmen, I don't think his line is anything to brag home about",1
This is where context matters in cricket which stats can‚Äôt capture well. Iyer is 28 off 28 but it‚Äôs a great innings already.,5
Graeme Swann fanboying over Brian Lara is the best thing,2
Great comeback dc,2
Solid 50 Shikhar D!,2
The 5 star ads are absolute trash,2
"Have to commend the captain Iyer for playing the perfect role of the anchor and let Dhawan ko bonkers. 


We need Smith to do that, but he has been losing his wickets early, going for slogs in the last few matches.",3
Love seeing Dhawan pretty much come back this game and pretty much address the criticism and bat better cause of it.,1
But is this strike rate good enough for r/Cricket?,4
RR relies heavily on their two all-rounders. Unfortunately only one is world-class + a match winner and the other is an useless English bloke,4
What a godly shot,5
The OG 'Lord' Stuart Binny takes offence at you plebs using the title on Tewatia,5
Iyer's last couple innings are KLesque/Dhonistic for some reason.,4
Fuck,0
Is that really Dhawan?,0
Rajasthan royals should sell themselves if they perform so shit every year,0
Royals should learn from DC  how to come back to game after losing consecutive wickets,3
imagine our line-up doing this against DC‚Äôs bowlers.. not a chance in hell,2
Shikhar Dhawan has now hit the most boundaries in IPL history - 549,8
This is a prime example of experience never not paying off. Great innings so far Shikhi.,5
Big salute to RR bowlers for making ODI Dhawan to T20 one,8
Dhawan with his bahut hua samman shot.,2
I said this about Gopal. He has been pretty shit throughout this season and consistently gone for plenty of runs,0
Believe it guys.. it's Shikhar and he's absolutely smacking them.,2
Who‚Äôs gonna win IPL?,2
"Thank god Dhawan playing aggressively, we can't afford to have three anchors in the same team.",4
"So who's karma farming for ""Dhawan Apology"" thread?",7
What is ICC Dhawan doing here?,7
Dhawan back in WC and Champions trophy form,6
You only take a single if the ball is going to Archer,3
Thala Iyer,4
"He's not Dhawan, he's The One.",10
I have never agreed with KP more,1
[deleted],1
"Wide and umpire gave that, hmmm",3
Hit out or get out time for Shreyas. Soaking up the Hulk's balls,1
I replaced Dhawan in my Dream11 today and he is showing me middle finger now ü§ï,2
"Can someone explain how can an angled run up to the crease, like Gopal's, affect the delivery?",1
"**Most 50+ Scores vs RR in IPL**

AB De Villiers - 7

**Dhawan - 6**

Raina - 4

S Marsh - 4

KL Rahul - 4",6
maybe not an individual but a captain's thing this is.,1
"Lol, guys Iyyer can accelerate, call him thala after 14th over if he shits the bed",2
Shikky bhai with the chill half century,2
"Look, Smithers, Gabbar Is ~~Back~~ Coming",2
Lmao Gopal Redemption,1
"We did it bois. We memed Dhawan back into form.

Edit: Spoken too early",2
Fuck. Dhawan was going so well.,5
Dhawan finally being Dhawan in IPL 2020.,2
200 incoming,1
What the fuck Shikhar... That's such a terrible anti climatic Innings,3
"Iyer stopped riding his bike when petrol pumps started 'no helmet, no petrol' rule",2
"Dhawan always slogs and loses his wicket to spin like this. 
Nevertheless great innings from him!",3
Bring on the gun show. Time for STOINIS,3
Ffs shikhar,2
"Dhawan was doing so well

That was such a shit shot, should've just spanked it through cover",4
Grr why DaOne,6
"Yeah match is gonna slow down way more now. Iyer is basically useless, Carey might hit some.",0
Well played Dhawan,3
"Dhawan played like way Pant does, perished in the same way as Pant. A good knock nevertheless",4
Back to Village. Great innings though /\,4
"Needless shot, but played a good innings",4
Dhawan threw away his wicket. Completely unnecessary shot,6
WTF Gabbar. 50 is not the end. Poor fucking shot,7
Shreyas' slow strike rate put too much pressure on him. Dont know why KP is talking up a run a ball innings,4
Shikar needs to put that shot away!,2
Bring Archer back before the death for an over,3
"Dhawan quite frequently gives his wicket away like this. Solid knock, though. Well played.",3
"**11.4** Gopal to Dhawan, OUT, and Dhawan perishes trying to force the pace **95-3**

S Dhawan c Kartik Tyagi b Gopal 57 (33b 6x4 2x6) SR: 172.72",2
Great fucking knock,1
r/cricket praise Dhawan so much that he gets out.,7
I don't know why y'all are belting Iyer. He's playing the situation. Dhawan was the aggressor so he's just rotating the strike and giving it to him.,10
Great innings from Dhawan tbh,5
KP is Shikhar Dhawan's fanboy,5
Dhawan playing reverse sweep is like a boomer using hashtags to get along with the kids. Why don't you play on drive or something,3
Why did srh let go dhawan still baffels me. Now they are having problems because of the overseas limit.,5
Why would you want to do that. Fuck off man. Second time he got out this way. So unnecessary. Fuck off.,3
Stoinis storm please,3
Dhawan getting out will put an end to KP wanking about Iyer playing the supportive role lol,8
Suicide sweep claims another,5
Dhawan always gets out sweeping against spinners,3
Marcus Punter Stoinis gonna do the rest,6
Should've sent Carey,2
He had perfect touch why did he have to give his wicket away to this nothing shot .. smh,2
Bit ironic from KP for criticising Dhawan's choice of shot!!,3
"Kp, he doesn't practice it at all",3
I fear the power of the Stoin,5
interesting to see how Shreyas will go about now.,3
CMV: dhawan has a really short attention span and loses concentration after 30-40 balls,4
Should have send Carry,2
Delhi's at a great place right now. I'm not sure if criticism on Iyer is warranted as of right now. He can accelerate well.,5
Shikhar will amaze and frustrate you in the same over,6
"Dhaean has realised he doesn't have the ability to take it deep and then explode, so he took risks and scored where he finds it easy. Took him 3 days to adjust his approach, some people are struggling for 3 years but are too arrogant to adjust. Cough cough",5
"No One

Absolutely No one

r/Cricket every half hour or so : Okay 1,2,3 mother lovers be around ya!",5
Should've sent in carey with 8 overs to go,6
I shouldn‚Äôt have watched it... jinxed it the moment I switched over,6
Where is hetty,6
"After last match against MI, Dhawan might have gotten a nice ass whopping from Ponting, and it actually worked",6
What stoinis doing in 12th over üò≥,3
"Iyer's played himself in well while Dhawan was smashing it

Time to accelerate",3
"What a reply by Dhawan!!! 

If he shows such intent for the rest of  this IPL, don't mind him being in the WC T20 squad as the reserve opener 

Always risky selecting a new player for such an important role, also India hasn't tried any Opener expect Samson",2
Par score estimates on this pitch?,1
"Good knock.

Though I don't see the intent(TM) when running.

Ball went to long off and only a single was taken. Next ball, ball goes to deep mid wicket and another single.",1
"Irfan Pathan - ""This is a problem with reverse sweep. Can get out if the bat doesn't hit the ball properly.""

Great insight Irfan. BC what kind of shot doesn't carry that risk - saala Hindi commentary ko gobar Bana rhe ye log",5
I would like an Archer over now to get one of these two out. But T20 teams are so happy not captaining properly.,2
"Bowl Unadkat/Tyagi next, then Archer",1
What the fuck is ‚Äúlockdown ki love story‚Äù LMFAO,6
"Failing switch hit, in front of KP. Yikes.",7
KP has hit the nail on its head. Hope he hears this.,2
Sanjay Bangar is much better at analysis than commentary,3
War of Allrounders : Round 1,3
Should give Archer an over now,2
Oof. What a stupid way to throw your wicket,7
Dhawan playing maxwell kinda of shots in the hope ponting likes him.,1
I wanna see our OG god Smithers bowling,3
If stokes and smith don't perform good in this match then we can safely say that they both play only for money.,1
Why do they call it the cow corner?,3
anything over 120-130 and rr will need divine intervention of tewatia levels to fish them out.,5
Iyer playing test,3
Tewatia vs Stoinis? That much electricity could've powered Mumbai during the blackout,7
Iyer auditioning for ODI spot,3
ICC should seriously consider banning these ugly ass shots from Cricket ffs,3
iyer looks very tired. is he sick or something?,4
Dumbslog millionaire haha,9
Why does Dhawan even try switch hit... He was playing so well,4
Shreyas one-dayer Iyer,3
Ah Sulieman ben. Lanky bloke,2
Shreyish Iyerandey,3
"Come on Stoinis, do a Tewatia today.",2
Dhawan was batting so well playing regular shots and then gets out playing that....,3
"Iyer trying to do a MSD to get the wide lmao

Didn't work",11
Cmon Iyer you should be smashing spinners. Not simping,8
"I think, Mayank should be the reserve opener for T20 WC, or even the regular opener in place of KL, if he keeps on performing better than him.",8
KP's voice is so unfortunate for commentary. Props to him for making it work,1
"r/cricket memeing Dhawan back into form and praising him out of form in an hour

Parkour",10
Iyer's heart broke into million pieces when the ump didn't give that a wide,10
Iyer might be playing 34(34) but he is playing the best 34(34) I have seen,5
It'll be difficult to royals if DC score 170+,2
"Dumbslot Millionaire, that's a good one",3
Iyer isn't a T20 player. Iyer isn't a T20 player. Iyer isn't a T20 player,-10
I have a feeling that this is a difficult pitch and Dhawan wad just an exception.,4
"Why is everyone trying reverse fucking sweep, you aren't all AB",11
"Commentators praise Iyer for not playing a reverse sweep like Dhawan did

Iyer next ball: plays a shit reverse sweep",20
DC wants to self-destruct,2
What on earth is a mother lover?,7
Don‚Äôt piss the Lord off,2
Team letting Tewatiya down,4
Shreyash would be good in ODIs if he keeps his composure,4
Who wanna go to expo 2020 Dubai w me,2
Learning from mistakes is overrated - Team DC,3
Reverse sweeping doesn't get you 1.5X runs man,3
Has the downvoters made an entry yet?,-1
Does Tewatia have an attitude? Always looks angry or is arguing with someone,8
"Iyer: *hits shot*

Iyer: *smacks lips*",5
"Who do y'all think should be the other opener for India, other than Mayank, down under later this year?",2
Buttler will try a reverse shot after seeing all these shots and will get out on 22(9),38
Friends don't let friends play reverse sweep,1
Umpire telling tewatia to calm down. Lol. Just like how Warner has to tell him to calm down the other day lol,2
"Buttler puts the average in average when it comes to keeping, doesn't he",5
Iyer is such a good captaincy option because he's giving fielding practice to each individual,2
"Why play these dumbass shots, it's not the early days of T20 where everything went",1
Why in Lord's name would Fucking Iyer try reverse sweep???,1
"Classic defence from Stoinis, I'm loving the first session today",5
"170 is basically a winning total at this ground esp against RR and currently they look all set to achieve that , what's  with this Iyer criticism?",1
tewatia gonna get himself is trouble at this rate. yelling at warner the other day and now the umpire. -\_\_\_-,6
i hate that reverse sweep cutsey shit,5
Hulking time,1
These silly shots are catching on faster than covid,6
"Punter: Whoever plays a good switch-hit this game gets a Xbox

Dhawan and Shreyas:",16

STOP IT LOL,2
Just fly out some random dude from Delhi and put him in place of that chutiya Rahane,3
Pleases my heart to see Dhawan taking the spinners to the cleaners. Well played Gabbar!,3
Has Buttler always been this average?,3
Need an IPL team to buy Ben Foakes for the banter,7
Shreyas Iyer thinking he is Dhoni and can intimidate umpires into giving or not giving wides,2
That‚Äôs my Captain,1
Smith is retarded for saying they'll still send Stokes to Open. What they Should have done from the start was to send in Uthhappa as the Opener and if he failed to score in 4-5 matches then Manan Vohra but RR management think a lucky Draw for opening slot is better,3
13 times 8 is 104. Who knew?,4
Tewatia and archer have been amazing so far. They both wear very noticeable chains while playing. Coincidence? I think not,5
Tomorrow rcb vs kxip. gonna be absolute meme,9
Why is the term ‚Äúsexual preference‚Äù offensive now?,0
don‚Äôt remind us of morgan bowling rashid in the final over against australia in that ODI,1
Damn dawg. As soon as coffee hits my lips I need to üí©,3
Extras - 8,1
r/Cricket seems to think that a T20 match cannot be won without a 150 plus strike rate for the entire 20 overs.....,18
"KL Rahul : ""I got the orange cap... but at what cost?""",2
Gopal has been bang average this tournament,2
What a great start to the first session of this 3rd test,2
Lord Tewatia sure has issues with someone each game :p,4
Did Buttler used to open before RR made him do it?,4
"Bangar is the nerdy kid in the dugout, but makes no sense sometimes",3
Thums up ads have always been so extra,2
Lmao Iyer has a lower strike rate than kl but no one cares because his team is winning,1
"Iyer, time to use those long handleTM.",3
Just shielded my eyes to not see the table,3
Rahane is much better player than what 2 off 9 might suggest. But no way this innings doesn't provide fuel for the noise of the cricket-is-played-on-a-calculator casuals. Shame,2
Has there been a case where the orange/purple cap winner was in the bottom place team?,1
Was that the old DD owner?,1
"The problem with Iyer is not his run-a-ball knocks, it's the fact that 9/10 times he plays 35 balls at run a ball, hits one six and then gets out. The Sharjah game vs KKR has been the only exception. Delhi have gotten away with it because Stoinis has been exceptional, but with Pant and Hetmyer out, Iyer has to ensure that he finishes innings off. If he plays his typical 44 (38) in the absence of Pant and Hetmyer, it will hurt the side big time.",4
How much did KP get paid to praise that Delhi owner?,2
Delhi's Mota Bhai in the house boiz,6
Lol the owner giving no fucks at all,3
Lol what's Pant doing,7
"In alternate universe, Unadkat can bowl deliveries apart from off-cutters",3
Ayy throw that fucker out,2
3 overs of Unadkat for the death? Do they wanna concede 200?,2
"How many of you here watch all formats - test, ODI. Or just IPL mostly?",6
"Glad to see Pant, he will back soon ‚ô•Ô∏è",5
Lmao the Dugout is hilarious,5
Maybe Iyer will smash now.............................................................,3
KP is cringe as af,3
My god Rishab Pant is chubby.,8
"Alright, KP, I know you want the dc contract but this is too much",3
"That fat guy among the DC owners (DD) gives me PTSD, reminds me of the dumb bids in the auction lmao (Pawan Negi 8.5 cr, Yuvraj 16 cr)",6
Why take such a long run up when everybody knows it‚Äôs a slower ball,4
Anyone find stoinis attractive or is it only me !?,12
Pant is thicker than I imagined.,5
Pretty sure they'll be calling him 'Straya Sawyer down under...,3
Beautiful Shreyas,2
170+ and dc will be favourites eh ?,3
thanks unadkat,3
Fuck... 190 is coming,2
Why aren't we going after average bowlers like Unadkat? These two are going too slow.,4
Is Rishabh Fat or just muscular?,2
Pure sex. The shot was good too.,3
Didn't know they could air blowjobs on live TV,2
Love Pant,1
That's the iyer we know and love.,6
"Lord Unadkat, never change",7
The way these commentators are gushing about the billionaire owner of the Delhi Capitals makes me think it‚Äôs basically paid propaganda. They‚Äôre praising him to the skies.,9
"Tbh, KL wouldn't get all the slow inning hate from here, if he wasn't at top for orange cap race. People want their favourites to be on top, and KL playing ""boring"" & having most runs, is annoying.",2
You're telling me the owner of a team is *passionate* about it?,2
Unadkat pulling his inner Unadkat,2
Rajasthan is such a sad team,2
Ehhh...why Unadkat?,2
"Unadkat conceding just 10 runs in 9 balls when Iyer and Stoinis are on the crease? Am I fucking dreaming?

e: Ah there we go. Back to normal",1
Wtf. Why is Dhoni being mentioned by KP?,0
"Unad comes steaming in, shrieks *aaahhh* , bowls 106 kph.",4
That's a tewatia maximum,2
Big fan boy of big daddy dhoni but kevin bringing him unnecessarily and comparing sixes is just annoying,1
I mean if this doesn‚Äôt seal it idk what. Iyer should be the number 4 for t20 and Odi. Not more bs experimenting at 4,3
Unadkat is out there to help the t20 wc team selection. Batsmen who can't score against him will be dropped,5
Our captain!!,2
How does Unadkat go from being a god bowler for Saurashtra to a run machine in the IPL?,2
Real question is whether Samson will be consistently inconsistent?,4
Iyer's running between the wickets üòç,5
What a catch,4
Stokes jesus,6
That‚Äôs out,3
wah Ben stokes,2
Holy shit. Is that caught?,2
Oh damn stokes,1
what the fuck was that oh my god stokes,1
"It's Ben, no way it's not out",2
Fuck this shit,1
What a recovery. Iyer played a critical part,2
Stokes takes a great 'make it look easy' catch.,1

This is the Unadkat we know and love.,5
I think that's a six,2
"""Ginger ninja"" LMFAO.",3
"Is that out?

He jumped back in and caught it before landing back in play right?",2
Ben stokes wtf,1
cant we go a single match without dhoni being mentioned ffs,8

Bhenchod what a catch ben stokes,1
Rajasthan bowling without Archer is a Syed mushtaq ali bowling lineup,2

great attempt though,2
Don't understand how Unadkat is so consistently shit,3
Oof that looked dodgy,2

"damn, great effort",1
"Good effort from Stokes. 
(Happy it's not out though üò¨)",7

Why does Shreyas even try big sixes on this huge ground,3
"Shreyas Iyer: Hits a 6

Commentators: start praising Dhoni",30

Six. Very clearly so,3
This is six,3
not out,3
Rajasthan can't chase 160 properly. I way they are letting Delhi get away after getting an advantage is ridiculous,5

Just touched before he threw it i think,3

It's 6,3
That's England's ass,12
Why would you even hit it in the general vicinity of stokes. Got away with it this time,9
Should be 6 runs,5
Mate just push the ball in why do fielders try to catch it ???,1
Thank fuckkkkk,2
Keep calm and trust Carey,2
"7 years ago this would have been appreciated as a great effort. 

Now it seems like ""He should've parried it earlier""",17
CHAKKA !!,3
"Is a six, Nice",3
I always feel bad whenever there‚Äôs laughter in the com box from something said on air. Like dammit I wanna hear too,8
I don't understand why they saved 3 unadkat overs for the death. He gets some wickets with pies but it surely can't be worth all the runs he leaks.,11
Umpire will go by the body language of Stokes or was there a soft signal?,3
iyer is ram fuck yea,3
No one logistics wise would be supporting rr but rr supporters lol,1
Goti muh me to back to where it belongs,6
Yeah that is six. But 10/10 for effort.,11
"If he had let go of the ball before, it would still have been a 6 I reckon. His last point of contact before he catches it back was outside the boundary. He caught it mid air.",7
It‚Äôs 6. Move on!,6
Unadkat back to his form,3
Hey Mr producer just freeze it on the first frame his foot touches the ground next time,6
Shreyas can raise his bat now,3
"Commentators: Dhon..

r/cricket : Its time to bitch",3
Benjamin not du plessis Stokes,6
Rohan gavaskar: i think that's out,1
I don't remember the last time i saw this type of catch failing,2
Something Stokes did didnt turn to gold for the first time in 18 months,3
"That's a 6, foot still in ground and ball in hand!",5
"A few years ago that would've been a great attempt

Now everyone's disappointed he didn't catch it

Shows how much fielding standards on the boundary have improved",9
"I guess the rule says you have to come back into the ground to take the catch. Stokes threw the ball in, and then caught it when he was still in the air. That means he's technically not in the field yet.",4
Good effort by stokes nonetheless,7
Iyer is so good,6
Amazing effort from Stokes.,5
Soft signal out? Based on what?,5
Ben Stokes is one THICCBOI,2
"Agar Iyer aaj century maara, toh Mai mutual fund mei invest kar lunga",10
"Stokes was gonna release it sooner but thought it's Unadkat, a six would be funnier",13
Ben stokes has a nice arse in that shot,9
One bowler bowling unit is not going to work too many times.,3
We see more of Dhoni in ads than when he bats,6
Unadkat should be released into the wild,4
"Just want Smith, Buttler, Stokes and Samson to make a big score today.",5
"Unadkat. More like, gonads-cut.",5
Stokes making sure the stakes are high for RR,5
I can never find these catches more impressive then a regular diving catch,13
Tyagi has to go!,1
Unadkat getting smashed. Normalcy has been restored,5
How tf unadkat turns into this six machine in ipl every year after being almost unplayable in domestic cricket?,8
"If you have to complete this kind of a catch, the rules say you have to come back in the field, that is have your feet touch the field first and then catch it again. Right?",6
I wonder if Iyer visits Rohit Sharma's House to play Fifa,9
Split second in it but the right call,8
"Now i know why Dhoni's either tired or finishes early. KP sucked him dry. There's an eintire genre of the things KP does for Dhoni. Dhoni's not as bad as this thread says, it's people like KP that makes it hard to love Dhoni.",3
Good effort by Unadkat and Stokes to make match more interesting.,2
"I have a hypothesis on the downvoting. I think it happens whenever our match threads go to top on http://reddit-stream.com And it has to be a bot to downvote that many comments.

Current a r/Politics thread is at the top. If you see rampant downvotes happening, someone please confirm if that's indeed the case.",4
It appears like DC never lost those 2 quick wickets in the PP,4
Did Iyer complimented Strokes for his effort?,3
CHAKKA MAARO,3
"RR has no other reliable bowling options except Archer ,they should hope stokes gets his way with bowl to help them",1
I like how stokes and smith play. Come top order hit some runs so you don't look sus take checks go home. Buttler jofra seems to at least give fucks.,6
"Happy to see such efforts at the boundary by the fielders. Happening every two games, was a rare sight a few years ago",2
Unadkat may manage to win the orange cap as a bowler,9
How tf did he play that,9
Damn that was a good yorker,4
How the fuck he got away with that lol,7
Imagine having a sure shot wicket taker like archer and still being such a shit bowling side,7
"\*Unadkat in the first 9 balls - 10 runs*

""2020 strikes aga...""

\*In the next 3 balls - 14 runs*

""Business as usual boys""",7
fuck thats well bowled,3
"Can't bat, can't bowl, can't field

What's the point of this Stokes lad",9
"did not like that sound, goti muh me again",1
Haha Swann is a fucking crazy guy.,2
"Just so everyone knows, the law also does state that his feet have to touch back in to the field of play before he catches. His little move of jumping up before recatching, would've meant that it would be 6 even if he let go of it in time initially.",3
"**Most 50s for DD/ ~~DL~~ DC in IPL**

Shreyas Iyer - 15

Virender Sehwag - 15

Rishabh Pant - 11",12
What an Yorker,7
Hell of a yorker under pressure.,8
Brilliant yorker. Unlucky to not get Iyer,5
Did really well to save your ass there Shreyas,8
AW NO,3
"Dugout Shit talks on Stokes  ""Now that he misses the catch he must be a Kiwi, 10 seconds ago he was a champion athlete from England""",13
It was Not Out even if he had thrown it early. It looked like he even collected it wrong way as his feet was toucing out of the ground before he collected.,5
Did it hit his bat,4
Did he shout oh no!!!!!! üòÇ,7
Tyagi bowling real good,8
I have seen more of Dhoni in ads than him batting this IPL,11
Don't wanna jinx him but Tyagi has impressed me so much. Keep it up lad üëå,12
Love the hot mics. Oh ya bastard,7
Damn... Tidy over for Tyagi.,3
Lmao,1
Was LBW out didn't appeal,3
Imagine if they showed stats of which player has conceded more runs . RR bowlers would top the list considering they've the highest economy,7
That was actually a good over by Tyagi,7
"Fucking life for 2 times now for Iyer 



Edit :- gone third time",9
Fuckers can‚Äôt hit Tyagi!,12
Finch would have called it bastard.,14
Lol nobody‚Äôs even thought of it,25
"Swann just called Stokes ""Ginger Ninja"". Is that name popular?",15
Nice Tyagi gets the big guy,7
What an over ffs,10
Tyagi > Nagarkoti,10
whoever called that wicket alert in the dugout *damn*,6
That was such an excellent over from Tyagi. He gave nothing away,5
Great over under pressure,5
Why was Stoinis clapping there? FiXInG CoNFirMEd?,11
What an over from Tyagi,7
Petition to call a batsman scoring a 50 in 40 balls in t20 as doing a Rahul?,9
Top bowling,5
"**15.6** Kartik Tyagi to Iyer, OUT,  **132-4**

SS Iyer c Archer b Kartik Tyagi 53 (43b 3x4 2x6) SR: 123.25",2
"r/Cricket when Dhawan steadies a 50: wtf how dare he

r/Cricket when Dhawan scores 50 quickly and gets out: wtf how dare he",31
Tyagi got his scalp one way or the other,7
What does Rohan Gavaskar brings to commentary? He sounds like he has difficulty speaking.,6
Choke Fest tomorrow üòã,6
Jofra is so good at catching.,6
"Ability, luxury, license. These boys have it all.",2
Perfect wicket! Lines up with strategic timeout and end of the over!!,4
RCB vs new RCB tomorrow lol,6
I have the ability to talk about how bowlers don‚Äôt bowl enough yorkers. I can also comment on how these must be executed properly if they are bowled. I will also guarantee to say this at least eleven times per innings. Does anyone have a commentary job for me?,6
"Damn ,Tyagi is freaking good",4
Well done Tyagi üëèüëèüëè Well done Joffer üëç,2
Decent knock. Could've been much better though if he had stuck 2-3 more sixes in quick succession.,5
[Called it. Iyer fails to finish once again after getting off to a slow start.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/jazg1j/match_thread_30th_match_delhi_capitals_v/g8sw5k3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3),-3
Shreyas saw the lbw in big screen and gave his wicket away for fairplay .. good guy iyer,19
Great over by Tyagi,4
Beautiful bowling!!,6
"Can we all take a moment to appreciate how Jofra never celebrates after taking wickets or a catch. The dude bowled Prithvi Shaw, middle stump, first bowl of the match - just walked away. That's some gangsta shit",11
"Ffs I had to go for a piss, missed the action and as I get back they go for a timeout",7
Just 2 overs remaining. Need to make them count,6
Scenes if RR loses by one run,8
Tyagi better steal some skills from archer and play for India,8
What a great over under pressure by Tyagi,3
double rs taking wickets at important times just need to stop a large score,4
Archer got so much swagger it's not even funny,12
Terrific over from young Tyagi. Super impressive.,13
Tyagi has a very good seam position. Future test bowler in the making,10
this is now deservedly a kartik tyagi hype thread,4
Iyer out? Time for Jethalal to make a move on babitaji,8
Tyagi should be in Australia tour man he's fucking good,0
Good comeback by tyagi,2
Iyer couldn't live with that guilt of plumb lbw lol.,15
That catch was very good. Unbelievable by IPL fielding standards.,2
Any news about Gayle?? Can. He play tomorrow??,3
Bruh Tyagi is fantastic,6
Let's see what Carey got!,2
Jofra has taken some really good catches this season. It's rare to see fast bowlers being great fielders too.,5
Want RR to win today and KXIP to win tomorrow. The tournament must not lose its competitiveness.,8
[deleted],10
Kartik 'Lee Sharma' Tyagi,2
There is no sportsman I hate more than Rahane,-6
Tyagi > mavi/nagarkoti,1
Facebook bringing cringe adverts with them since their conception.,8
Archer feels like a  bowling cheat,1
Tyagi>saini. But ofcourse saini will get chance to play for india because we all know why,5
And Unadkat is the senior most bowler in the squad,2
"Even if Stroke's leg had not touched inside the boundary while throwing the ball out, that should have been a Six because the last point of contact of Stroke's body before completing that catch was inside boundary.",1
"those facebook ads make me agitated, hot, heaping mass of garbage",2
Great innings by Iyer. And great over by Tyagi. Just put a brake on DC's momentum.,1
Eng Vs Aus,4
Need 170+.,2
So carey at the end anyhow has to face jofra now,2
How's that not a no ball?,7
[removed],-1
Who will Lord tewatia fight today right after winning the game for RR,5
Wasn't Carey being called Gilchrist embryo earlier in the 2019 wc?,6
BC that‚Äôs a no ball. Wtf!,1
English team led by an Ausie bowling to two Ausie blokes. What is this a crossover episode,10
Aussie middle order in now,1
Imagine Pant or Hetmyer coming in here. Sigh.,6
Australi vs England looks nice today,7
Would like to see Carey and Koach running combo,8
Damn...we 2013-18 Delhi now boys,7
Open with Carey and drop Shaw.,4
Belly button full tosses are fair game now?,3
WAIT FOR THE OTHER BOWLER STOINMAN PLEASE,3
"Out of context, if iyer marries, Shreya, will he become Shreya's iyer??",13
Missing Hetmyer in these situations,2
Did Swann get out of the commentary box at all in this innings?,2
"bruh we could've had pant and hetmyer right now, why God why",6
Jofra's a cheat code,2
Is Stokes going to open again today?,2
What a shot,2
"What a shot!
Bring out that BBL form Carey..",3
What a shor,3
Is that 6? Fuck!!,4
What was that...... Fucking unbelievable,5
Shot Kez,1
I want RR to win but I am also a CSK supporter.,-3
No way that was below the waist. Everyone moves on because its not csk lol.,0
wtf that's a six?,1
Beauty shot,0
"Wtf has happened to stoinis ? He wasn't playing great for australia. In big bash and ipl, he's doing great.",1
Alex Carey looks a bit like Jason Roy. Is it just me?,4
Carey was ready for it,2
Cracking shot,1
Flat as F,4
God damn what a shot,3
Archer is great but how about 1 SR and 0 average Adam Gilchrist?,4
Carey hit a six of archer......ooff,0
Alex Wadey,2
"People thinking Carey is a gully cricketer, only to realise he is Australia's WK",22
Score looking ominous already,2
Reminder how much better the batters do when they actually attack jofra instead of dread his pace,7
Uthappa preparing for his ‚Äò2nd innings‚Äô there,2
RR are royally screwed really. Can't see how they will chase this,-1
He got out to Archer after that 100 using that same shot,2
149.5kmph on shoulder. Ouch,2
Being in a team and training with Nortje is probably one of the best things for Carey,2
In a tough spot here. Can Alex Carey his team?,21
'Shotboi!' - Mark Nicholas went full club cricket there.,3
What an Aussie fuck off duo. Now get us 40 off the last 3. Please boys,4
"Guys, anyone remember that jof delivery from the world cup where he bowled someone and the ball took off and went for six behind the WK?",10
"Where's Shimron "" lappebaaz"" Hetmyer today?  Dropped for Carey?",3
WC Carey please,5
I know Kartik Tyagi is good but he has a long way to go before he reaches the levels of ATG and CSK legend Sudeep Tyagi.,7
Just a flick of the wrist for a flat six. Wow.,6
How did that not hurt like a bitch?,9
Commentators not hyping unreal shots but start fanboying when Dhoni takes a single,24
Who's gonna bowl that one over ? Stokes or Unadkat?,13
The HDFC ads with Raju Rastogi are the worst ads in Indian TV history,40
"I liked the way Robbie signaled a six to the umpire for that flat shot from Carey. At least, he is helping the umpire",28
hulk out,3
Why was Dhawan and Shaw holding hands? Are they homosexuals?,15
"For what it‚Äôs worth, Carey before this series basically only batted at 6 playing for Australia. I might‚Äôve counted wrong but I think he‚Äôs [only ever faced over 10 balls three times batting in this position](http://bigbashboard.com/player/alex-carey/log)

Nonetheless that‚Äôd be the reason for the disparity between his stats up and down the order",5
"For the millennials from India, I just realized that RR's uniform colour scheme is like Big Babol chewing gum.",15
Tyagi has been low-key fire üî•,4
That leave gave me vietnam flashbacks.,7
Tyagi boi bossing stoinis,6
Come on Stoinis do you're magic,6
"STOINMAN it's okay, wait for Unadkat last over. Take a single here it's okau",2
"With Sharjah pitches getting slower and slower, Dubai remains the only ground where balls still coming on to the bat. RR batsmen should back themselves to chase today.",3
Bruh wtf he's fucking good,9
"Karthik Tyagi with that haircut can certainly become Hathoda Tyagi 

Context:  Character from PaatalLok",5
Saini or Tyagi?,2
Stoinis of RCB has decided to make an appearance today,5
Rishabh Pant is the best T20 batsman in this DC squad,8
Good over so far,3
Tyagi showing Jofra how to bowl at the death.,3
Where is all the big dick energy today,2
Why tf do random bowlers manage to become Bumrahs against us?,7
Imagine how slow these pitches will be by the time of playoffs,8
Woah Tyagi is excellent,4
Nattu you have a competitor for your Yorkers,8
180 would be good from here,4
Come on.. hit a boundary,6
"TYAGI just couldn't wait to ball his next ball,just minding his own business",6
MS Stoinis,7
"Literally any shot involving wrist.

Most commentators : M.S",4
Nailing those yorkers,3
"part of me wants them to play it safe, part of me thinks tyagi is getting too cocky and needs a shot",1
A six here is still a good over,3
A+ over so far,6
Next unadkat over going for 25,7
Tyagi simply bowling a yorker every ball,12
Tyagi bowling so well damn,6
"Nattu, Tyagi suddenly become yorker machines against DC smh",8
Those were 2 fucking awesome overs at the death Tyagi! Take a bow!,7
Sky sports showing ads halfway through the over...,2
"21 in first two 9 in last two, Tyagi Ji driving in reverse",8
[deleted],6
I think DC should drop prithvi and let stoinis open. Pant/carey/hetmyer can handle the big hitting down the order,7
"Excellent over, wow",3
Amazing over by Tyagi,3
"Commentators : MS

R/Cricket : *Heavy Breathing *

Commentators  : *M*arcus *S*toinis",8
Top bowling there by Tyagi,3
Tyagiüî•,1
Those last 2 overs from Tyagi were fantastic,4
Tyga bowling fire,1
Archer learn from the young lad,3
"Tyagi 0/22 off his first 2

1/8 off his last 2

World class bowling.",9
"literally unplayable, gg lad",4
"Brilliant spell of death bowling!!

Tyagi you absolute champ!!",6
That‚Äôs the best death bowling I‚Äôve ever seen from a debutant. Bravo yung Tyagi,14
"What an over from Tyogi, bowling against two international players and only giving up 5.",9
Geniune question: Is kartik tyagi related to sudeep tyagi?,6
Man I just love watching these Indian lads brings me so much joy,6
"Well played DD! It's only the 18th over, there are 32 more coming up. No need to be too aggressive",5
Batting with another Australian is taking Stoinis back to his usual terrible form he shows for the national team,7
Tyagi pretty much just bowled 12 yorkers straight. Yorker bot on,9
"If Tyagi can put on a bit of muscle , as he should with training, he can be a really good prospect. He‚Äôs already got the IQ.",5
Stoinis moves Queen. Tyage moves knight.,8
"tyagi take a bow son extremely well bowled, just stuck to his plan",6
"K. Tyagi

The K stands for Yorker.",8
Did everyone in Delhi forgot how to use the length of pitch. The guy is nailing balls in yorker length. Get the fuck out of the crease mate.,3
Anything above 165 is a good score.,3
Can't even hit a full toss smh,-1
Dhoni continues to live rent free in commentators heads,12
Unadkat to bowl the last over lmao. 180 is on,10
STOINMAN wait for the last over plis,3
Natarajan and Tyagi remind me of old school death bowling where it was just fiery yorkers every ball,5
"Tyagi at 19: Bowling Yorkers in IPL

Me at 20 Infront of my TV: Interesting",109
RR‚Äôs death bowling so far /\,8
"swear to God, iyyer let Rabada bowl two overs without break",3
This over will decide a lot. If Stoinis and Carey can take on Archer then that changes the whole momentum of the match.,5
RR might not win today,3
Last over destruction incoming for Lord Stokes/Unadkat,3
"A decade ago, Tyagi would have been fast tracked into the senior team. Since we now have capable set of pace bowlers, we have the luxury of developing him for a while before thrusting him into the international spotlight.",2
that was 2 of the most UNREAL death overs i've seen and from a guy that got a haircut from Steve smith the night before,3
Is it harder to hit full toss this year?,2
So stoinis on 16*(16). When do we start talking about intent today? The word is in vogue this ipl.,4
We haven‚Äôt been able accelerate ever since we‚Äôve lost Pant and had to made forced changes to the line up. The batting doesn‚Äôt look as menacing anymore.,3
"BC, 3 full tosses and 3 shit shots..",6
Does anyone know which duty pays more in the IPL contract for foreign commentators -  gushing about 'young Indian talent'? Or orga-ming about the Altroz?,7

What is this lower order hitting? üò≠,2
"Ah, that replay. So wholesome!",2
From 10-2 to 170ish ... I'll take it,4
Good bowling + good fielding is soooo good on the eyes.,2
Archer is the best T20 bowler in the world right now,3
Rubbing my hands in Glee for the final over,1
Bro ..this is trash,1
Marcus Thala,8
Stonis with INTENT.,3
Unadkat gonna make it up for all these singles,3
arrgh wtf is happening,1
These two balls should be free hits for Carey tbh,5
Only thing that makes this okay for me is the knowledge that we have bowlers who can do this too,8
Prithvi shah has a terrible technique. He's very similar to sehwag rather than Sachin,5
Archer doing the Bihu dance!!,7
Thala Stoinis,6
Very talented to get a cheeky single off of full tosses,5
I didn't consent to seeing an irfan pathan tweet,2
Archer you beauty,3
Is it actually that hard to hit a 150k full toss? I've seen this happen with Bumrah - bowls a plump full toss but top batsmen can't seem to get it over the fence. Is it also psychological?,4
RR is nailing their yorkers and we don't have our pant to play his falling scoops.,9
Class bowling from archer,2
"dumb, should had take single here",8
What a shitshow from Delhi. Fucking disgrace.,8
You could have just held on for one ball,3
Fucking beautiful Archer,3
"Tyagi playing his 4th IPL match and some folks here are saying ""he should be selected over Saini but Saini will be selected because he plays for RCB"" lmao",18
Thala Stoinis.....,2
3-19 from Archer get in!,4
Dot or single would have been better than the wicket for DC,5
[deleted],1
I just told my dad there was gonna be a wicket in the last ball... my mind,5
Shitty innings by Stoinis today.. happens.,6
This was the Stoinis I was used to seeing at KXIP,7
This is the Stoinis we know,6
Australian Stoinis back again? Where did the other one go?,2
You could wait one more ball you fucker,2
"Stoinis got out bc Iyer put pressure on him

All Iyer's fault smh my head",2
"Dare say, these last 2 overs may cost us the match.",5
Damn you stoin couldn't you have waited for just one fuckin ball,6
delhi is atleast 25 runs short.,2
They‚Äôll still score 190 if Unadkat bowls the last.,4
Excellent ODI innings by our team. So proud!!,7
"Clutch death bowling this, from RR",7
Top over Jof,4
Can't get past the Lord,2
So many chinbras,3
Fuck off Stoinis,3
"If Unadkat bowls the final over --- koi maaro mujhe, maaro",1
"So, DD with RCB Stoinis decided to turn up today, okay",2
How good is Tewatia,7
10 runs off last 12 balls. And your power hitter is gone. Ouch.,6
Stoinis single handedly sucked the momentum out of the DC innings,3
If you have already played so many singles and dots why not wait one more ball and hit against Unadkat?,6
Has tewatia dropped a single catch this IPL?,5
Only 21 runs in last three overs,3
jofra fifer lets gooooo,2
Stoinis back to his usual tuk tuk 2019 WC form,-1
Unadkat please don't undo the past couple of overs,2
"If they can‚Äôt hit Tyagi, they can‚Äôt hit Archer lol",4
Now Lord Unadkat will come only to leak 20 of his last over.,-1
"Not enough runs on the board, we've fallen apart completely with one Pant injury",4
Discount Shashtri in,1
"The commentators were talking about Dhoni, so Stoinis decided to play a Dhoniesque innings. Respect!",5
"**18.6** Archer to Stoinis, OUT, short ball, a little ring of fire, quick and wide, getting big on him. Stoinis looks for the hook but goes only as far as deep midwicket **153-5**

MP Stoinis c Tewatia b Archer 18 (19b 1x4 0x6) SR: 94.73",4
unadkat wow we‚Äôre fucked for sure now,4
That's the Stoinis we know and Shane Warne loves,2
20+ final over incoming,2
Losing 2/2 because of lower order not knowing how to hit 6‚Äôs,0
Just goes to show how difficult it is to hit at death,1
"Archer doing that dance is so wholesome, damn",7
"1 bad innings and already being shat on, guy has literally been all round MVP for us but yea sure",5
Note to self: Team combination is an important thing,1
Jaydev jaydev jay mangala murti üôè,3
Great innings stoinis. Halla Bol.,1
"Solid bowling this is, take notes csk bois.",2
Unadkat to spoil Archer and Kartik's hard work in 6 deliveries.,7
Phenomenal death bowling.,6
Archer is the bowler of this tournament so far. Hasn‚Äôt failed to deliver yet and he‚Äôs been bowling the death overs which messes up his stats but still has great stats.,7
Miss Hetty here :(,2
Looks like Carey doesn't hit straight much.,2
Yeah this team isn't making top 2. The chokejob has begun after the MI loss. Rahane is going to make sure of it.,5
There aint anything that Stoinis could do against that pace,2
Bc declare ready bkx,2
axar is discounted jadeja.,-1
Carey has hit a six and is still almost run a ball lol,2
Hey aren't the matches in UAE looking a little boring with matches happening in just 3 stadiums compared to 9-10 stadiums where IPL would be played in India?....,4
Sublime spell by Archer. Stay beautiful Joffrey,3
Delhi fans realizing just how important Pant is,2
6 Free Hit balls incoming. Grab as much as possible Delhi,0
"Guys, what‚Äôs the timeline for pant‚Äôs return ? :(",4
Lmao i thought Styris said Unadkat doesn't know how to bowl,1
DC have hope. It's Unadkat,2
Declare now so that we have a few overs to their new batsmen before stumps,6
Rabada is the only person I can trust in this team..,3
"Again, Pant's 30 off 15 is what DC are missing",3
"Dang, Unadkat over Stokes",1
Axar farming the strike. Pig.,1
170 and DC chances are 70% to win,2
Unadcunt?,1
Feel like shit just want Pant and Hetty back,2
"Young Indian players with a hint of talent should be no brainer for franchises. You get them for 20L, 50L, 1 cr, etc.. If he is any good or great, he can flourish into a decade long prospect.

Gill, Bishnoi, Tyagi, Mavi, Nagarkoti all seem good long term potentials

I don‚Äôt get why many franchises seem reluctant.",2
"So, Delhi capital back to being daredevil?",1
Hope Rahane plays against CSK too,2
"Wtf Carey, should have run for the third",1
I think Delhi have enough already these slow wickets don't encourage very exciting cricket,1
RR winning this by the 17th-18th over,2
3 of the most industrial death overs from Archer and Tyagi. Tyagi's was a revelation,1
Has Unadkat gotten better or have we become what we always were?,1

Axar runs too slow for Alex 'former Australian cricket 2km time trial record holder' Carey,1

Unadkat redemption arc,1
Bowling fast full tosses could be a legit strategy lol,5
Yeah missing pant and hetmyer right now so bad,4
This is some of the worst death batting I‚Äôve ever seen. At least Dhoni hit sixes in the last over. Can‚Äôt even hit Unadkat.,10
Delhi are 20 runs short. Their low end batting wasn't good enough.,2
Australian WK gets out to Unadkat,2
Give em the two points already. Fuck off.,1
Low Full toss is equally effective as yorker.,2
Just logging on who got the RUNS,2
Pant: Miss me?,7
Well that was underwhelming to say the least,3
Shambles. Bye bye playoffs without Pant and Hetmyer,3
Hetty :(,2
Should have made 180.. struggling to get 160.,3
Mankad Ashwin,3
3 wickets and two catches from Jofra. Not bad.,5

"Outside top 2 finish is basically useless, so this IPL is over if they lose today boys.",1
"Rabada, Nokia and Jai Mata Di",10
has the pitch slowed down?,1
"In IPL 2016 and 2017, medium-fast bowlers like Unadkat, Bhuvi, and even Dinda did pretty well. But quicker bowlers like Rabada and Steyn got hit. The trend is the exact opposite in this season where the fast bowlers are doing well while the medium pacers are not. Is there any particular reason for this?",3
No one this ipl seems to hit full tosses for boundaries. Bizzare.,1
Shit ass depth of Delhi. Hetmeyer and Pant needed as soon as possible. All are fucking ODI strike rate batsman.,1
I still think it's going to be a close game and Lord Tewatia would have to save RR again...,2
Pitch must be doing something because why else Smith would give the last over to Unadkat,3
"Finally, the all too familiar sense of toothlessness that DD were somehow hiding in the first half of the tournament",1
Jogra Archer should open the batting with his golden hands today,4
Should be banned for this. Can't hit Unadkat. I don't think a lower bar exists,8
"I just imagine like if DC goes on a losing streak and come to the point where they have to rely on some magic to qualify, that would make an interesting IPL",6
"Great bowling front tyagi, archer and now unadkat!!",3

Ah so full tosses can be hit too,3
Are we seeing a reversal of results in the second half of the tournament?,7

Archer involved in 5 out of 6 wickets,5

Axar Patel has already contributed more than 4 dedicated batsmen,2

Unadkat GET IN,2
The score might be par,3
Just 1 4 and 1 6 in death.,3
"With the bowling that Delhi have, they might still make a game of it.

The batting, considering the platform they had ended up being 15-20 runs short.",4
What a shitshow,3

Thats pretty good over from unadkat,6
Axar used to be in the ODI team as an all rounder,1
Fantastic death overs from RR,5
I still think DC have reached a par score on this ground.,1
Fucking Unadkat got two wickets. Where is the justice in this world?,6
Open with archer and tewatia,7
15-20 short.. maybe we will bowl better..,2
Archer has been such a force this season. Cummins would be happy to have half this much impact.,5
"This is good death bowling, they hit the yorker length very well. Suddenly DC looking like CSK lmao",6
Thank you Unadkat,2
Unadkat takes two wickets what is this,1
these two wickets were tyagi's,2
Scenes if Unadkat mankads Ashwin,2
Worst 16-20 completed innings this season?,8
161 is very defendable with DC's bowling lineup.,6
"**19.6** Unadkat to Patel, OUT, big slower ball, at 99.9ks, wide outside off, and Patel is nowhere near it. Toe-ends this for a catch to short third man **161-7**

Let DC down big time tonight.",12
RR don't bottle this one,3
162 to win. Chaüëèsaüëèbleüëè,5
33 runs off the last 5 overs is the worst batting I've seen in a long while.,5
32 runs and 4 wickets in the death terrific stuff,5
DC has the attack to defend this total,3
Stoinis missed out on scoring 10 more runs at the end by getting out on Jof's last ball,4
Unadkat taking two wickets is peak 2020.,5
So May be Axar should come at 5 next game. Carey ain‚Äôt it,2

161 is below par. RR has a very real chance here.,5
"One 4 and one 6 in last 5 overs!!! 

Well done RR",5
Man if only Smith can remember that he's god-damn Steve Smith and just bat like he does instead of flailing his bat at everything they've got this.,8
This score is ceiling of DC without pant,3
Smith shouldn't slog mindlessly today,2
Last 5 overs 32/4. When DC had 7 wickets in hand.,18
Even unadkat bowled well against us. Lol. Fuck man. This batting line up is not working out. We need big hitters back.,5
DC has about par score but they will rue the fact that at one point they were looking at 180-200. But they have bowling attack to defend this score so lets see how RR go about their business.,6
"Being saying this from day 1, Delhi lacks fire power at the top. And if you take Pant out of the equation. You loose even more fire power.",6

"A rebranding worked for DC, maybe Punjab should try it as well?",4
Dhawan looks pissed,6
this is 40 runs too many for rr unfortunately.,7
32/4 in the last 5 overs. 160 is still a good score. But should've finished with 170-180. RR should fancy this target.,6
"161 isn't out of the question for RR to chase and a lot lower than I thought it'd be after the powerplay, stokes really needs a good knock to get his confidence back if he hits 30+ RR are really in with a shout",8
Shikhar 'Me to acha khela na' Dhawan,11

They better hope that until he is fit, their bowlers carry DC.",8
I blame Dhawan for playing that reverse sweep lol.,4

"r/cricket reactions

Last game Dhawan scores 69 (52) : You fcking donkey",14
Really hoping Rajasthan does the Assam dance after the winning shot again,3
Delhi capitals are digging their own grave,2
How long is Pant injured for?,3
Easy Peasy chase for Lord Tewatia,3
Unadkat not playing for opposite team for straight two games!,3
"Just get Tewatia out, and you win.",4
Don't know what fairplay points are based on but RR's over rates have been quite good compared to other teams.,5
"This should be good, total is very gettable.",2
looks like the pitch has slowed down considerably. my money is on rr making 95-111 runs chasing.,2
Iyer too many starts. Needs to convert into bigger scores as captain.,7
"Well irrespective of the result, DC are 15-20 runs short",5
"I know its a bit random but I wonder what happened to KC Cariappa. He only played one game in Chinnaswamy and got hit around by Gayle and AB (and got AB out) and never got to play another game. KKR apparently released him this year but I find it hard to believe that no team wants to have him, looking at Varun Chakravarthy's success so far.",4
Ashwin 0*,4
I hope DC don't do a 2018 KXIP,3
Tushar Deshpande will turn out to be an absolute joke of a change.,5
DC also seriously need to look at their opening pair. Which has worked only once or twice in last two seasons.,4
Dhawan is shit. Should have score 100 more runs rather getting out like  a trash.,-2
Unadkat 3 overs 2-32. RR would take that any day of the week,5
Cric info says worst last 5 overs for bat first team this IPL.,10
Who is in the lineup for RR today- 68(36) Sanju? Or 8(3) holes out to long on Sanju?,3
Buttler has to perform for RR here,4
Will delete my account if RR chase this,13
So will Stokes open again today?,2
"Good job by Rajasthan. Now they need to pace their chase well. A 30-35 run power play won't cut it as the wicket gets harder to bat on in the latter part of innings. They should target 45-50 in first six, with a loss of no more than 1 wicket.",6
Wtf ? Why would Mark throw KP under the bus like that for?!,3
RR fans don't be too excited. I fully trust RR to bottle this up.,1
Can we please stop this Carey experiment please. Throw Rahane out. Bat Carey at 3. Bring Lalit Yadav at 7.,8
The question is the pitch is getting slower or Delhi batsmen. My money is on the pitch since it is a used one. Hoping for a nail biter,3
Hope Shreyas learns from what Kohli did and saves his spinners for the middle phase.,7
Smith opening is still a better option than ben stokes if they are not interested in uttappa,4
Me sweating as a SRH fan with RR clicking together as a unit at the right time.,12
Unadkat was not the imposter.....,6
It‚Äôs pretty simple really. Your top 3 need to be your best batsman in T20 cricket and I am 100% certain that Shaw isn‚Äôt one of our best batsman.,7
"Shikhar Dhawan is so prepared that he brought out the ""we were 10-15 runs short.exe"" well in advance.",17
Should open with uthappa not stokes. it's not fair to him or stokes,5
"Iyer's IPL career SR is 128. Out of 8 inns this year, the only innings in which he had an SR of 128 or above is the 88(38) against KKR at Sharjah.",8
Delhi gonna have to bowl really well... RR are really good with chasing thanks to a certain man named Tewatia.,5
Unadkat is GOD on slow pitches,2
Smith doesn't want to play Uthappa in team. I am sure he is getting force by Warne to play him .,4
"I am telling you shaw is the impostor, dropped dolliies last match and duck this match.",5
"This looks below par but our bowling has been top notch, so we might have a chance. Batting needs to improve real soon.",5
"If tewatia can hit rabada, nokia and Rashid, I'll smack anyone who says he is a one hit wonder",12
Place Shaw at the field where the ball rarely comes.,8
"Don't think Stokes will open, I think that was just a way to take the pressure completely off him in his first game back.",5
I miss dhawan at srh. We should'nt have sold him. :(,4
Whose catch will Shaw drop today,5
Why don't they try Manan Vohra? He used to be really good for us. He hasn't gotten many opportunities since. Should drop Robbie and open with him.,9
[deleted],2
"Akash Chopra calling Ab De Villiers and Virat Kohli ""brothers from another mothers"" - literally.

Cringe af.",14
In b4 rr 33-3 in pp,1
I don‚Äôt hope to see Rabada and Nortje overs left with the match already over. Iyer has been consistently guilty of that!,2
Is swanny secretly a redditor?,7
"One benefit of these couple sub-par innings is that Pant will gain some credit with the Indian selectors. Sure, he's not particularly reliable, but he has the potential to get you 30-odd runs striking at close to 200, which is the kind of innings which elevates this score to 180ish",9
I need an RCB vs DC game where Kohli says 'Sachin banenge Bhosdike' after Shaw is dismissed.,39
Delhi are missing Pant big time.,9
"**DC While Defending below 165 target vs RR**

Won : 2

Lost : 5",7
"I know Buttler-Stokes is probably not the tactically astute opening partnership in this situation (it's different to Sam Curran because RR's problem isn't batting too slowly!), but after the test vs Windies it just makes me horny",9
Shaw‚Äôs IPL record is mediocre. I think he should retire from IPL and focus on becoming the best Test batsman since Bradman. He is capable.,0
Why would a commentator want the match to go till last over? Do they get paid by over?,0
"Jesus, Simon Doull peddling this BASRA nonsense on air",0
"Keeping Khaleel and Unadkat in mind, I don't know whether wickets are that important a parameter in T20s. Shitty bowling is getting wickets while batsmen are just knocking singles off the better ones",4
friendly hourly reminder - CSK scored more than DC yesterday.,9
"Just realized this game is a win win for me. If DC win, MI drop one rank, if RR win, CSK drop one rank. I am tired of their oligopoly",17
"Copying from another comment. Why Delhi is probably not the best team to win due to lack of firepower 


> Sometime openers are too slow. We saw that in one game Delhi chased and lost that one. And few other game where top order was too slow. They will be exposed in playoffs if they have to chase 180+. Top order will eat too many balls and lower order will have too much pressure at the end.",2
"Prediction time. I think RR will finish in top 4, KKR and SRH will miss out.",2
So my friend is a delhi supporter and I an RR supporter. I get nudes if we win. I hope the top order gets their shots right so I can shoot my shot later tonight.,1
"Batting order for RR:

Opening - Butler and Uthappa
3 - Samson
4 - Smith
5 - Stokes
6/7 - Parag, Tewatia
8 - Archer

What do you guys think?",-2
Cricket live guys have jinxed Royals. We are f\*\*ked,6
But mind you the fact the same pitch was used yesterday. And I felt the pitch was holding back towards the end of DC's innings ( but still Delhi are 15-20 runs short ). Delhi have a good bowling order. Interesting to see how it goes.,1
"Stokes and Butler opening

Smith 100",0
Uthappa is in RR playing XI? Easy win for Delhi,1
"God, throwing all the internationals at the top against Rabada Nortje is so stupid",3
"Mostly I feel the best team should win. But today, I want RR to win with Riyan Parag not out at the end.

Reason: Want to see Bihu again.",2
Why send Stokes?,0
Not again. Stoke opening what's with rr management.,1
Tyagi is 1000 times better than Unadkat,4
Going back to the Daredevils days is my worst nightmare,1
Off topic question: Which team was the best team to finish runners up? Personally I feel 2016 RCB or 2014 KXIP.,1
Ben Stokes should definitely open as he's our 2nd best batsman and he'll be wasted down at 5,4
Stokesy opening again üòêüòêüòêüòêüòêüòêüòê,3
Muhammad Kaif reminds me of my brother carrying all my stuff and notes just before jee exam lol,1

stokes please prove us wrong king,5
getting a feeling Ashwin gonna mankad someone if DC start poorly with bowling,1
Warne looks like the Raiders owner,0
Buttler AND Stokes? Only a 10 wicket win will satisfy me.,5
Don't bowl there KG üòÖ,0
Smith got hit on the head pretty hard huh?,0
Grrrrr this is literally the worst opening combination RR could have pulled out of their ass,0
Well tyagi my lad you've been brilliant today...,0
Okay. That's it. This will be chased down in 17 overs won't it?,1
Lord Tewatia should open. Send the best player first,5
IMO 2016 & 2017 team of RR was the best one.,0
"Stokes. You did well. 

Went from negative to positive points in my fantasy team. 

Now get out pls",1
Ashwin Mankad will cost us fair play points but Dhoni‚Äôs anger probably did not cost CSK lol,4
Smith persisting with Stokes opening is illogical and utter shit strategy. Looks like he doesn't think that highly of Indian players in the team. Hope we find a new captain,-2
Stokes is my VC in D11 and he's currently at -3 points. Time for redemption,2
Ashwin should open the bowling for maximum meme potential.,1
Shaw can pass off as 19 as well as 34.,8
WHY ARE YOU RUNNING,6
"It's another Steve Smith tailor made total. If he f\*\*ks this up, he better warm the bench next match",4
"  And against a lot of conventional logic, Steve Smith sticks to his word at the toss, and sticks with Stokes - the man brought in to strengthen the middle-order in a team of top-order batsmen - as an opener.",5
Village Village Village,0
Just checked in; glad to see Shikhar has done well. There are some cricketers who play for sheer joy of playing and he's one of them. I love his attitude and approach towards the game.,2
Why don't RR batsmen communicate when running?,0
Almost had a heart attack don't do that to me Stokesy,4
"We play so fair, we never run anyone out.",6
"Same day in future

Stupid Sexy Jos,5
"No effort, just timing",2
RR have 2 very good IPL openers in Uthappa and Manan yet they choose Stokes who's a god at finishing? Ok,5
Bruh that run tho,5
Exquisite shot from Buttler,3
Send your goat in. Always. Dravid next.,4
"I'm with you Nico, thst was very close. KP is blind",1
Shaw looks like a kid with his hat on and like a lorry driver with the hat off,7
That's a cricket 19 run if I've ever seen one,6
RR showing so much Intent when they don't even need it.,2
Shaw has that mustache so that he can use Ravi Shastri's ID to get alcohol because he can't legally drink until he's 21,32

Glorious stroke Jos. *Grabs cock*,6
I fucking love my super over boys,11

That was pure porno from Jos.,4

And talk about batting",3
love rabada even more for being generous in that first over,1
Super over bois are here,1
Was it a easy or tough chance that rahane missed?,1
Wtf is Tushar?,-1
Rahane had a chance to contribute in this match but just missed,2
Great start guys. Halla Bol,1
Stokes stats look just average against his perception,4
Brett Lee without the jump,1
"Why are they playing an opener in the middle order, and an allrounder as an opener? seems like a short term plan, just hoping stokes can get them off to a good start without giving much thought to it.",1
"Seeing Deshpande for the first time, how's he?",2
"Very unlike Rabada, that over. One on the pads, one a half volleys. Guess you can't have him bowl his first over for two in eight games straight.",1
SIX EM JOS,1

Headingley Shot!,6
Shut up Mark Nicholas,2
"Cut Away.

Cut away for four",10
Rajat Bhatia 2.0,1
That shot gives me Headingley PTSD,6
"I think DC can experiment with one pinch hitter at the top like Axar Patel. It will provide some cushion for players like Rahane, Dhawan or Prithvi. And remove pressure from lower order. Their opening pair isn't working any way.",2
That shot had the Headingly winning 4 vibes,7
Two non sense balls. Let‚Äôs see where we go from here.,2
Has Stokes been sent to Blast like Curran?,6

I came. ü§§,3
Never doubted Stokes as an opener... Never...,6
"Man, this is a proper Daredevils performance",4
Tushar looks eerily similar to thakur no?,2
It was good while it lasted. It had to be an injury to bring us back to reality. Good run,3
Think Rahane went for the wrong end. Buttler had barely taken off for the run as he was picking up the ball.,5
Rajat Bhatia lite,2
So nortje is kept back for final overs,4
Where are the people shitting on Stokes opening decision now?,2

Yes bois we're losing it :(,2

It's refreshing to see good old hits for a boundary,1
Imagine being a top notch international all rounder and having keyboard warriors judging you for something you have given your life to,9
Unadkat having so much fun in the dugout watching another bowler being hit,3
WHY IS PRITHVI SHAW AT POINT,5
Why did DC drop Harshal for a new ball bowler? His variations were very good in middle overs.,5
keep saving the best for last overs and there are going to be no last overs,3

Stokes is such a good example of the stats are for prats motto. Phenomenal player,19
Tushar Deshpande's expression says 'why would you bowl me against Stokes and Butler',56

I want to watch these two bat like this for hours,5
Our batsman were afraid to run when the ball didn't Pass through 30 yard but RR batsman are just running for it without any fear. And we're not even trying to pressure them for no run. We ran short by atleast 15 runs because of that.,7
Bring Ashwin,3
RR would be tough to beat if their top 4 comes in form,7
Rr suddenly looks like a dangerously good team,7
Hold me Jos,3

152 benstokes!,8
152.3 kmph,8
Nokia you were the chosen one,3
"You guys need a wicket, like, now...",3
Went to get dinner... Came back two overs late... And shit... Just shit. This is not looking good.,3
152.3 KM/H!!!,6
It‚Äôs like they did not learn from Lagaan that they need a Kachra!,1
If Norkia goes for two sixes and two dots: Norkia 6600,3
Jos and Stokes capture the essence of Halla Bol!,3
These 2 are capable of taking the game away in the powerplay alone,2
Lord Tewatia has given RR a morale and momentum boost.,5
Nortje‚Äôs action is identical to Jimmy Pattinson‚Äôs.,1
Bring me Ashwin next BC DC,2
Bring in the mankad expert,3
All the *fast af bois* of IPL bowling in this match?,1
The only thing I want from life right now is for Jos to smash the window of that fucking car,10
Buttler has a shoulder shrug similar to Murali Vijay,2
Ashwin should bowl next over,2
Oh yeah baby,2
"Highest opening stand by RR, lmao.",3
I came,3
"152kmph. Damn, Nokia upgraded to 5G already.",9
Bring on Ethical. Mankad is the only option left.,2
29 is the highest open for RR wtf.,7
"Why the fuck you do that to someone that fast, Butler?",3
This is fearless batting,5
I think they might've had this discussion during the innings break. This match is an opportunity for RR to pump up their rather disappointing NRR,2
DC getting murdered here,2
"Alright folks, game over.",5
"Since ashwin has already warned all batsmen, Delhi should bring in Ashwin and keep Stokes on Strike.",4
DC pulling off a 2018 KXIP here,3
Scoop in 3rd over against a 140+ bowler,6
Pffftttttt this is ridic,4

I think DC bowlers are missing chirpy pant behind the wickets,3
Anrich Tortilla,4
how can he be so confident holy shit,4
This opening pair is sick if they fire regularly,4
So it wasn't a slow pitch then..... Damn. This is like the MI game all over again.,8
How did butler do that at that speed twice üò≥üò≠,5
Dont care where you're from or who you support - buttlers ramp is fucking beautiful,4
I wanna see Nortje go for runs. So far he's escaped the beating ofc becuz he's bowled well.,6
Bouncer incoming,2
"How the fuck do other countries get trained when you get applauded for sprinting for every run? Like it‚Äôs so surprising when people applaud you for running hard and fielding properly?

I stopped playing at U14s when I realised I couldn‚Äôt keep up with the fielding training and the sprints.",2
Go on Butler. We're gonna lose anyway,2
I wanna see Ashwin mankad someone and then Punter run out onto the field and roundhouse kick him.,4
End this already,5
RR look more like champions than MI so far!,8
Bring on Ashwin DC. Give us Ashwin v Buttler.,3
**just buttler things**,4
"Goodnight lads, until next time",5
buttler in murderous mood tonite.,6
I came all over the place (‚òû Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)‚òû,3

You love to see it,2
156.2 kph üòê,11
"Wow two worldcup champions on work. DC pacers demoralized. And ""experts"" tipped RR to finish bottom lol.",3
Guys i think i am having an orgasm,4
Did not know Sebastian Vettel played for dc,5
Points to jaa hi rahe he. NRR bhi le jayenge,3
The balls on this man damn,3
Huge possibility that Axar Patel bowls the next over,1
RR set a target of 80 for PP,1
Was that 156kph? That's serious pace,6
English pant & Dube looking good ngl,2
Holy shit 156!,12
WTF..... 156KMPH,13

FUCK YEAAA,3
HOLY SHIT that was fast,10
Fastest ball of the ipl 156,10
Ok boys. We've lost this.,2

155kph bowled. I'm entertained...,3
155 KPH WHAT THE FUCK,7
BOWLED‚ÄôIM. Great comeback Nortje.,2
Won't get to see the Ashwin Buttler faceoff but great Nortje delivery,6
ANRICH DADDY üí¶,2

Fast bowler are the charm of cricket! What a ball!!,3
Angry boi Nokia,3
Men and short-lived orgasms is the only combination that will exist for an eternity,3
Finally,3
Is this the fastest over in the IPL history?,5
That was an incredibly entertaining over,6
SEND SAMSON!!! DONT SEND SMITH!,3
Y u do this butler,3
Someone predicted Buttler would get 22(9) earlier iirc lmao,3
Gas Gas Gas.....,4
Nortje so quick,4
Damn if butler was there it would have been 70 for six overs,4
156 and then 155 this lad just bowled two of the fastest deliveries in **IPL HISTORY**,32
In today's episode of classic comebacks! Feat.Nortje,6
Buttler is ssly fucking underrated,5
"Somebody called wicket alert here, thank you!!!",7
"these guys were going for each other‚Äôs asses, what an over",8
Ohh my my this is Cricket of the highest order.,7
Nokia - Connecting people üòéüòé,13

"Fuck off Nortje, denied us Ashwin Buttler",12
Someone get Ashwin on to Mankad Buttler! Hahaha...,4
Wtf that's a missile! Hats off!!!!üôèüèº,6
I like pissed off Nokia bowling at 155-155,10
"Jos ""I'm afraid of Ashwin"" Butler",10
That escalated quickly,8
But Ashwin was waiting for Buttler LoL,10
Nortje clocking 155+ Absolute fire,12
Holy Shit!! 155 km/hr!!! Nokia!!!,12

What an over lol,7
What an entertaining over !!,7
"That four was a bat EDGE, few millimeters to the right, that was clean bowled. And Cleaned him up. What a come back!",5
Ashwin unable to mankad Buttler: *years of academy training wasted*,6
"Right there's a platform been set here, Smith has to take advantage of it",6
97mph holy shit,8
Oh I love this sport,4
FAST AS FUCK,5
Fuck my jinxing worked,4
We all know Buttler got out so he didn't have to face Ashwin.,10
Liked the contest.,4
This boy is quick üî•,8
"**2.6** Nortje to Buttler, OUT, bowled'im. Nortje has his own back. This is all fast and furious **37-1**

JC Buttler  b Nortje 22 (9b 3x4 1x6) SR: 244.44",2
Dude someone on this thread predicted exactly 22(9) lol,4
"Jofra top of the 150+ table 

Daddy Anrich: And it became personal for me",10
Omg I feel lucky to witness these high speeds,7
Buttlers bulge (‚äÉÔΩ°‚Ä¢ÃÅ‚Äø‚Ä¢ÃÄÔΩ°)‚äÉ,5
Nortje just bowled the 2 fastest balls in the history of the IPL (at least since 2012),8
Fastest ball in history of IPL....,8
156kmphhh FUCKING HELLLLLLL,10
"This is fun, all around good cricket.",7
"Someone tell them that they're chasing 161, not 261. Play sensibly. This has been a problem of the top 4 all season",4
That was rapid,7
That's what happens when you try to be too cute one too many times.,3
"152,152,156,155 damnn",9
Fuck that's fast. 155 kmph!,9
Once again Nokia proving to be resilient despite taking a beating,11
Iyer fucker better give Nortje another over after that!!,6
That was some over,8
Nortje 100mph soon?,12
Oh we are not gonna see butler vs aswin,5
"Imagine being KKR rn, releasing Nortje & buying Cummins for 14 cr",8
That ball made me want to trade in my iPhone for a Nokia.,12
Nortje: speed huh? lemme you some REAL speed,8
Remember the world war memes? This shit's pacing comes next to that. Brilliant.,9
Fastest ball of IPL to Nortje (155.1kmph). Nice that it belongs to another South African.,6
[deleted],10
"If DC doesn't retain Nortje, they can get fucked. I'm changing team to wherever he goes.",12
Nokia would have crossed 160 had Jos scooped him one more time,47
One of the best overs this IPL.,14
Here's Smith to swing at 3 deliveries before chucking his wicket,7
"Holy shit. I absolutely get turned on by fast bowling & this is some epic shit.

He got tonked for 150kmph and yet Nortje just kept pressing the pedal",9
this over was freaking incredible to witness,6
if this is not the best cricket idk what is,8
3d chess from Butler. He didn't lose his wicket to Ashwin today,8
butler got scared of Ash!!,4
"Buttler, Smith and Stokes - tell me a heavier batting at the top",4
Oye SPD get your head straight.,3
"Damn, what a moment!! Commentators hyped it up nicely.


""Fall down seven times, get up 8""",8
It's anrich mothasucking nortje,3
Peak entertainment,7
That over was top quality cricket wow,10
"not even mad at that wicket, love nortje, he‚Äôs class",12
Nortje's got some searing pace,4
Damn Nortje was angry af,11
Mfw no Ashwin Buttler battle :(,6
That was an erotic over of t20 cricket,6
Ashwin back with his mind games again,2
Ok Nokia was fucking hot over there. Hotter than Cumm. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,4
"Nortje, Archer and Rabada in the same match. Serious display of fast bowling.",14
Might not see aswin vs butler this season anymore sad,4
And iyer didn't give second over to him.,1
4 balls above 150 in that over.,9
"Buttler getting out before Ashwin comes on is throughly disappointing 

Screw you nokia. Stop bowling so good",6
"Smith is a cheating dog, I hope he is dismissed cheaply.",-8
Buttler getting out before Ashwin comes in.....smart,7
The glare,3
"Holy fucking shit. All cricket played in those few balls was mind blowing.

The level to which these guys can push themselves to is surreal.",9
rahane is pumped lol,5
156 kmph is basically channeling the Speed Force,9
Is that the fastest ball this IPL?,6
True connoisseurs of phasht balling would've jizzed multiple times watching the last 3 overs.,2
156,3
Buttler afraid of Ashwin,2
"Alright Smudge, don't get out slogging like a number eleven now",3
"Archer : Dominates the fastest balls list

Nokia : Bonjour mf",9
This is a perfect wicket for a Smith classic innings,3
"Smith, if you play stupid shots, I won't be forgiving you. This is perfectly set up for you. Just anchor the chase!!",2
"What's the fastest ball bowled in the IPL?

Paging u/RTG-rohittugaya for some stats",8
This is the alpha fast bowling th world has been missing. 110 kph slower ones no way. Fucking step on the gas and bowl 155.,5
This is the quality we want from IPL. Not Jadhavs struggling against part time spinners bowling fulltoss.,5
Nokia's quick but is he 156 kmph an hour quick? Or do we reckon the speed gun's slightly dodgy,2
is smudge going to last more than ten balls today? be honest,3
He clocked 155 kms dude wtf,5
Meme Smith is here,5
"Shit Pant should've been there

Shikhi have you heard the term returning captain",2
This is the kind of innings the opener should play. No one wants 45 (43),1
"I want to see Smith bat well, but I need him gone so that Delhi can win.",1
Smith almost chopping it on as usual.,1
"Damn, surprised to see Cummins and Patto have both hit the 150 mark",1
"Just realized we won't see Ashwin vs Buttler, what is the point of this match?",9
[deleted],12
Damnit,5
FUCK YES BC DC,4
Ashwin you beauty.,7
Fuck off Smith m8,6
Meme Smith.,5
This is a fucking ridiculous level of cricket today,6

Oh well bowled Ravi,5
FUCK THAT WAS SO CLOSE,4
[removed],-22
Gorgeous bowling from Ashwin,8
Is that Ashwin or Ajanta Mendis?,4
Smith playing some school level cricket,8
Ash with the win.. thank you Smith.,8
So you've got probably the best player of spin world cricket rn and you bring in Ashwin?,2
On your bike Smidge. This ain't your format boy,9
Collapse loading,3
Ashwin > rabada + nortje,3
Bench Smith (not /s),9
Ash you beauty,4

Game on bois,3
Ashwin Baby!,6
"Wohooo, Ash u beauty",3
Pommie is a very underrated commentator,5
Oomph the speed such great bowling first archer and now nortje,5
"Oh Smith, you naive man.",3
"Lmao Smith is not having a good ipl

He's gonna murder India when they tour Australia isn't he",10
What's up with Smithy this IPL? Playing too loose.,6
Smith is shit in IPL,7
"156 kmph to 56 kmph 

Bye bye smith",8
How can anyone hate Ashwin,7
full display of Ethical Mind,4
Collapse incoming,5
As a CSK fan i just want the top teams to continue winning and bottom to lose so that we can continue believing in the miracle of CSK making playoffs again,5
Ashwin had Smith for lunch and dinner,4
"Ashwin pissed he didn‚Äôt get Buttler, so he contends with Smith",15
"Tewatia: fine, I'll do it myself.",7
Smudge being smudge,5
[deleted],6
"Ashwin was all over him this over.

Amazing",3
Oh.. oh..this one turned the tides quickly.,3
Smithy should have come back and played shield instead of this,3
Please do that down under too Anna,6
This is the return of the OG powerplay spinner. Beautiful,5
DUCK SMITH is performing consistently,4
"Ash Anna, no Buttler no Problemo",5
Nokia to samsung,3
Plz bowl Nokia next over,4
Steve should drop smith from the team :/,9
PROMOTE JOFRA YOU COWARDS,7
Standard Sanju failure here and RR are in a spot of bother,5
Steve Smith more like Steve Shit this IPL,7
"What a beautiful, beautiful over. Ashwin has still got it, man. üíØ",7
And so it fucking begins..,2
"Stevo, please give more of this when Ashwin bowls in December and January",4
Ashwin why were you shit for KXIP,1
Good boi Steve compensating Ashwin for Butler's wicket,4
Smith has been so shit after the first two games,6
"Bro Steven Smith, thought you were ""not outable"". What happened man?",4
"Damn smith has been disappointing,  can't drop the skip though",8
[deleted],13
Nokia my new fav bowler,2
I think in this match losing two wickets in the powerplay is mandatory.,2
this is the best I have seen Ash bowl... he is in total control during power play.,5
Pre-glimpse of the Australian tour,1
Who's keeping in Pant's absence?,1
"Nokia, I love you but kindly f\*\*k off",1
Damn it looked like they were going to run away with it,1
still pushing my #LabuschagneforRR agenda,5
Ash has still got it,2
Hope Ashwin does this to smith in Australia too,8
What is up with Smithy!,3
Why couldn't Smith have played like this in the Ashes ffs,9
bring in the 155,4
It's lord tewatia all over again !,4
Ben Stokes slow burn incoming,4
"Ok if not 33-3, pp score 44-4",3
Tewatia sitting in the dressing room thinking: Ah shit here we go again.,15
What the hell happened to Smith?,4
"**3.6** Ashwin to Smith, OUT,  **40-2**

SPD Smith c &amp; b Ashwin 1 (4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 25.00",3
Ashwin is India's best spinner and it's unfair he was dropped from the limited over teams,16
"Anrich Nortje was the absolute image of ""call an ambulance, but not for me"" right here",20
Smithy wants to get out of IPL or what,6
"RR fans: Please Smith play responsibly

Smith: Haha wicket go brr",9
Who would win Ethical boi‚úÖ or twitchy boi‚ùé,10
Smith - Kohli form mutually exclusive this IPL,6
"Wicket should be disallowed because Ashwins shirt number is three digits

Terrible, the games gone",6
Nokia one more over plz,7
"Team collapsing around Stokes, making me nostalgic for england games",23
Sanju 9(3) today? Or 68(37)?,5
Just Lord Tewatia stands between DC and two points today,8
Smith is having a shit time right now but people saying he is striaght up shit in IPL are hilarious. His overall IPL record is brilliant,8
Smith is having some sorry a lot of problems both in captaincy and batting,9
3 wicket in PP seems likely.,7
should have kept smith for max tuk tuk,8
One more over from the Replacement Killer‚Ñ¢,3
Smith promised middle order that he‚Äôll not give them too much burden to chase. Liar,4
Ashwin is having a good time this IPL.,5
The latest conspiracy theory must be that BCCI paid RR a shit ton of money to fuck Steve Smith up before the Test series,8
"I am afraid Smith is getting all the bad batting out of his system in IPL. He won't get out all summer when we go to Australia, isn't he?",9
samsON/OFF,3
No need to get hopes high. LORD Himself is yet to come so we're going to lose this one.,3
"Fuck, you just know Smith will be fired up as all hell when we tour there for the ODIs and Tests.",5
"Just saw Cricbuzz and holy shit, Nortje clicked 156.2. Ffs what's going on!",9
"Out too early to see Ashwin vs Buttler

In just in time to see Nokia vs Samsung",12
Perfectly set up for a Tewatia finish,2
Why can‚Äôt he bat like this in the ashes,7
Wow Ashwin actually deserves a place in t20 squad. He always takes wickets when given the ball,1
"And now it's Samson's turn to throw his wicket away like an idiot







I hope this comment ages poorly",5
Man I always get teary eyed and want to drink more when Delhi perform well. I remember I used to hate going to the school to avoid getting laughed at for supporting Delhi. We have been through so much shit.,8
Samson waiting ro be fried by pace,3
"Smith batting in top 3 and getting out within 3 balls is ruining the whole team. Also, bad captaincy decisions. Please make someone else captain",2
Smudge is a flat track bully confirmed,2
"Tewatia - "" Ah shit, here wo go again.""",7
Sanju please *try* today. How much work are y‚Äôall going to make Tewatia do today goddamn,6
Ashwin is a mega chad,6
Target 162 ..nokia ok imma match that with pace,6
Champ,2
"Can we get this version of Smudge for the Tests later this year please?

He's gonna fidget his way back to form with vengeance in that series, isn't he?",4
"Fuck... Samson is here

*Checks venue*

Ahh never mind then",2
Once again everything is about to fall on our lord and savior Tewatia.,5
"If Samson goes early I predict a total collapse from RR. Tewatia, Pirog ain't doing crap vs Rabada and Nortje",2
150 slower oneüò≠,2
Smith is painful to watch. Glad the cheat is out.,1
Samson batting at 2 down? Tf is this lmao,1
Can we agree that players should not have 3 digit numbers on their backs? Looks absolutely ridiculous.,2
Holy shit Nortje would look good at Gabba,3
Please don't capitulate RR I want an entertaining chase,3
"Here comes the walking talking downward form, Samson.",8
"It was weird, Ashwin didn't use himself during powerplays when leading KXIP.",5
Another stokes masterclass incoming,3
This match all signs of being a Ben Stokes masterclass.,4
Ashwin couldn't get Butter so he hesitantly got Smith.,7
Shikhar taking the pace lmao,4
So Samson Caught or Bowled?,1
Australia should drop Smith now. Blokes a busted flush.,16
"he is still clicking 150, dfkm bro üò≠",13
This is the fastest Nokia I have seen,14
You can see the glow in Ashwin's eyes in the replay when he realizes Smith has edged it,10
Vettel is faster here than at Ferrari,4
average of 152 kph,4
"This is RR's game to lose really. If you cannot do it with Samson, Stokes and the likes of Parag, Tewatia and Uthappa to come, then you dont deserve to be in top 4.",5
Lol his slower balls is in 130s,5
don‚Äôt think samson can survive nortje tbh,2
Nokia averages 152kmh jfc.,6
"Samson sweating bullets or balls of steel, find out in the next episode of dbz",6
"The only reason Smith is still not dropped for RR is because he is the golden boy of Warne.

Any other team he would have been dropped for Miller by now.",5
Smith is gonna make up big time for India tour of Australia. We‚Äôre fucked.,5
Samsung vs fasta pasta Nokia,4
Needed a full crowd for the previous Nortje over.,6
"Commentators are ""extremely"" impressed with  Shreyas Iyer's captaincy. What do redditors think?",5
"What's up with Smith man? Nothing.

Should give Miller a chance ?",3
"**Nortje first over**

148.2 km/h - 6

152.1 km/h - 1

146.4 km/h - 1

"Average of 152 over one and a half overs, my days",9
[deleted],12
I love Rajasthan so much. Always keeping the match interesting!,5
Nortje is more consistently fast than Archer I reckon.,4
ECB officials scrapping right now to get nortje,11
It would be crime to not revive Nortje in next auction. He is modern day Sohaib Akhtar,6
so quick that any delivery in the 140s seems like a disappointment,2
Anrich Nortje Philipp Lahm lookin ass,3
152.1 AVERAGE WTF BEHENCHOD!!!!!,7
Nortje has now bowled the 3 quickest balls in recorded IPL history,9
5 single digit scores and a 24 in his last 6 innings. Smith only in it for the üí≤üí≤üí≤,6
152.1 avg pace wtf,7
Ashwin was furious that Buttler was out before he came in to bowl so he got Smith instead.,10
Calm down nortje,3
Damn he broke the previous record twice in successive balls.,6
Nortje bowling absolute fire,4
Did Tait ever play IPL or was that after he peaked?,4
Creating new tables where CSK can be top I see,2
How has nobody heard of Nortje? Fucking demon.,3
Is it me or is Smith even more fidegety than usual? He's literally jumping around the crease,4
Still RR's game. Stokes has the habit of winning games. Tewatia too. Parag has been good.,7
Had anyone got a gif of those two butler shots off Nortje ?,4
What's Travis Scott doing in a RR jersey?,5
Mark Wood not getting the respect he deserves,5
Chris Woakes pulling out was a blessing in disguise for Delhi,10
Oh no what‚Äôs happened here,4
Fuck,8
Fuck don't get injured ffs,8
DC is cursed with injuries,12
DC needs shoulder insurance wtf,13
When will India get 150+ bowlers? I hope watching this IPL inspires a few kids and we see some of them bowling üî• in IPL in the future,4
friendship ended with everyone now Nortje is my only best friend,5
Arrey fuck,7
Iyer got rekt,4
Noooo Shreyas,2
"With each ball bowled, the batsmen's life flashes before him",3
Another dude dies!,2
DC is cursed,4
I am not a DC fan BUT NO NOT IYER THEY HAVE BEEN SO GOOD,8

Bruh not another DC player injured,4
Buttler : I've won but at what cost,5
Arrey bc nahiii,7
The Delhi squad cannot afford another injury,11
150+ For Nortje is like walk in the park,8
"Ashwin is a pussy, that's the difference.",0
Iyer is such a disobedient patient. Going the opposite direction,2
"Iyer seems hurt, Rabada next",3
I once played with a bowling machine. The speed was 135 and I still couldn‚Äôt play it. I would get bowled before I even lift my bat. I can‚Äôt imagine what 155 even looks like. Just peak cricket and unreal pace.,16
That's the (possibly former) Indian national team physio right?,8
ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME. WHEN HAS ANY TEAM EVER HAD ANYTHING LIKE THIS EVER,26
Oof that was nasty....,3
An opinion from arm chair expert::stokes should bat in middle order even if he performs well RR needs someone to stabalizing if top order fails like this.,8
Hopefully nortje doesn‚Äôt become a kolpak player given the current situation with SA board .,11
Someone cursed DC with injury joojoo,25
I think Rabada should be 2nd fiddle now seeing how Nokia is just freaking spitting fire damn boi,10
"yikes hope he is okay, looks bad",5
Badhiya. Sab aag me mood jao is se acha.,3
In old money that's 95mph average,3
Buttler should have gone for a 3rd ramp,5
Pls not another injury,8
PATRICK FARHART YEAHHHHH,3
WE ARE CURSED. FUCK 2020,10
"Tuktuk popped that shoulder.
Ouchy (‚äô_‚óé)",0

Why the hell are players diving here. It's a fucking desert underneath all the grass!,2
RAHANE CAPTAIN GUYS üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠,11
Who's the vice captain? Ashwin?,8
Goodbye IPL trophy see you next year.,16
Ooooo that's bad. Hope he is okay.,5

I guess the next on field captain would be ashwin?,3
Ajinkya Rahane back to captaincy (for now),4

"Nortje cranking it up tonight, more so than usual. Think 7 of his 12 deliveries were above 150k. Not counting his slower bowl, 146 his slowest delivery.",6
CSK next game against DC. Fortune smiles upon Thala once again,4
Honestly don't understand smiths batting. In a low scoring game where Jos has already made up the RRR a 50 off 50 balls would probably win the game.,7
Yeah DC. Get fucked with the injuries. Who gonna captain now? Hopefully Desi Jeff Bezos will do his magic,7
Rabada gonna get Stokes this over I reckon,3
"Who's captain now?

Dhawan, Rahane or Ashwin?",5
Nooooo Iyer-san ;_;,4
Commentators going on and on about 156. Rookie number. I consistently hit 160+ with Shadid Akhti in Cricket 07.,24
People saying DC is the unluckiest should look at SRH imo. They're literally dying coz of the injury issues.,20
RR don't need to panic. Axar and Deshpande overs are key. Target those.,4
Who is the vc,1
Surely ash has to cap?,4
Thigh slapping dance vs Bihu dance on the menu bois,4
Whoever was captain I love you already. Iyer would have bowled Rabada after 10 overs inexplicably!!,3
Not watching the match rn. Saw Nokia bowled a 156 kmph steamer. Wtf is going on.,5
"Fuck that advertising carpet, its 5 injured now for delhi.",1

Very stiff effort lmao",4
Rabada is having an off day..,1
"Dhawan or Rahane, who's Captain?",3
Our team has been really unlucky with injuries.,2
"HANDSOMELY

REWARDED",5
"At this rate, DC will have to field Ponting in playoffs , if this continues",10
This powerplay has been so good to watch. Extreme pace vs brilliant Batsmen.,4
Rahane can at least contribute with captaincy now,7
Dhawan captaining leg side and Rahane off side I think,11
DC are finished now if Iyer is out. It‚Äôs RCB and MI‚Äôs tournament,11
Who's the onfield captain now?,5
"Smithy has looked so rushed and frantic lately, it's a little strange. He was like this is the T20's against England too. Man needs some ritalin",28
Someone teach these Delhi players how to fucking dive,9
"As an Australian, the match form of our best test bowler and batsman (Cummins and Smith) is really concerning. I know that tests are almost a completely different ball game but confidence is so important, and I fear that if both of them are out of form come the Aussie summer test series against India, our chances of winning back the Border-Gavaskar trophy will be pretty slim.",10
Half trackers from rabada is so unexpected,9
Probably Dhawan is captain,5
"**Fastest Ball in the history of IPL**

Anrich Nortje - 156.2 km/ph (today)

Surely Rahane is captain right now?,3
I can see Stokes singlehandedly winning them this,11
Mr Big Dick Stokes,11
That was the most orgasmic over of this IPL,12
Ashwin as captain now pleaseeeee,5
Bro someone did totka on us?,8
Looks like Dhawan is the captain for now,4
"If we go by seniority, Shaw should be the captain",19
Yeah.. As if Delhi didn't have enough injuries to deal with already.,7
Hope Samson plays second fiddle.,3
Ponting dropped himself for MI in 2013 and became coach seems like he has to come back in team and captain now for DC at this rate.,15
I remember that Smith was left out of the 3rd? ODI v England because of a rusty net session,13
Imagine having Nokia Morris And Rabada in the same team,11
[deleted],12
Who's captaining and deciding the bowlers?,2
Ashwin dhawan and rahane to split captaincy ig,8
"I feel Delhi should get an Indian wicketkeeper as Ishant Sharma's replacement. That way Shimron Hetmyer can be brought back to the playing XI.

Can also trade someone like a Shreevats Goswami from SRH.",6
"Oo OOO ooo,I say - Mark Nicholas",3
Dhawan is the stand in captain. Lmao,2
"Seriously, Smith can fuck right off",2
Why does ashwin wear 999.  To honour Ronaldo when he was thin and fat?,7
"Ppl confused about who‚Äôs captain since there‚Äôs so much captain material in DC, meanwhile we‚Äôre fucked here at  KXIP over captaincy",11
Can we see a Tevatia today üëÄ,6
Didn‚Äôt KKR have Nortje before Delhi?,7
Yes guys Nokia vs Samsung is finally here.,9
Rabada used to bowl an unplayable Yorker in the early overs earlier but now he doesn‚Äôt :(,7
"Jeez, DC are not having any luck with injuries",10
I don't think DC even have any backup batsmen left. There's allrounders mostly.,16
Rabada bowling at 140 looks almost medium paced compared to Nokia @ 150+ lmao,20
NGL whenever Rabada doesn't pick up wickets in PP I panic,13

"That doesn't look like a popped shoulder. Even if it was he'd be back in 2-3 matches. I just hope he comes back for the next match, CSK v DC. That's THE match.",3
Just realized Gayle is playing in Sharjah tomorrow. So we have a small chance,11
I really hope Shreyas is okay...,10
wait sorry what happened to iyer,6
Smith having a bad IPL just makes me think Smith and Labuschagne gone ruin us in December,20
"What's mental about the Norjte speed is that his 156kph ball was ramped for 4.

Don't think my eyes would even pick up on a 156kph ball if I were batting.",12
So Dhawan is the captain?,2
Lara sounds so cute,1
Why is everyone asking who's the captain now? Pointing always was,9
Naku neeku Nokia,8
This match is sealed. The start gave Smith time to settle in without too much asking rate pressure. And once he gets in he'll make sure he stays till the end to see us through.,5
These two can run very well,1
"Drop Smith, Buttler/Stokes as joint captains and bring in Miller",3
"Nortje ruined the game, now the batsmen will see every other bowler in slow motion.",3
Samson gonna murder axar.,8
"How would you go about this chase from here?

Try to get to 50 off 4 overs with as many wickets available? Delhi dont have quite the death bowling strength as others 

Its a pity Buttler hasn't fired i do wonder whether in these conditions he'd be better as a finisher and have him opening on less sluggish tracks.",4
"That nokia over has to be the over of the tournament.

That would also make a great advertisement for Ipl.",16

Chill guys. Some BC is the captain of Delhi,6
Nice jinx by the commentators on Axar there lol,6
Samson you beautiful man,4
we were literally just looking at the sky for a whole second,5
Samson coming down the track to a spinner is so nice to watch,7
Axar streak broken smh,1
Is it just me or does the Hotstar stream seem to get markedly worse in the second innings of the match?,1
Ok Samson for indian team,4
102 meters,3
This is the first six Axar has conceded this IPL,7
Dammit. Six-less streak dead,4
Cameraman: That‚Äôs beyond my radar,4
Samson hits the ball beautifully. So clean,5
Sanju waited 4 matches for that,11

"Sanju Samson back to form too? 

*OH YEAH IT'S ALL COMING TOGETHER*",9
"I understand why Ashwin was dropped after the Champions Trophy. His own dip in form + Kulcha's form + emphasis on wrist spin + Jaddu's superior fielding/batting. 

Given how well he is bowling in this IPL, I would love to see India go with Ashwin and Chahal as their two primary spinners for the T20 WC next year. Rohit, KL, Kohli, Surya/Mayank, Shreyas and Hardik is a fantastic top 6, and the emphasis should be on getting in the best 4 bowlers and not whether the bowlers can bat or field.",8
156 kmph. 1 hundred 50 fucking six. 156! How the fuck do you bowl that and still look like you haven't given a single fuck!,52

Are we blind? Deploy the ~~upvotes~~ Samson apology thread!,3
"Also, the more this goes on with Smith the more I think my theory that Smith and Marnus are sharing a power bar is accurate, and Marnus emptied it making 167 for Qld the other day.",13
Why do they say performances in ipl don‚Äôt matter for picking in Indian t20 team ? How else would you rate ur t20 talent other than ur domestic tournament which has world class international players ?,14
"An ok start but the total still looks intimidating, these two have to try and see it through till the end.",2
"First six against Axar this IPL, and what a shot!! 102m",8
Sanju's one of those performance of the season bois,6
Dhoni rooming rent free in every commentator's head,12
DC better not have a 2016 2nd half repeat,6
"Samson ffs get out. You've played your quota of 2 good innings for this season, remember?",46

Samson: ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)",14
Kar Takatak sounds both bollywood and south indian mass beat,4
These first few overs is probably the best cricket from both sides of the ball we have seen happening simultaneously this season. Punch for punch. Still anybody's game imo,9

Is 161 even enough?,6
Ponting should come out of retirement if Iyer is ruled out for the season. Even a 46 year old Ponting will be a better captain than Dhawan.,16

axar back to his axar ways.,4
Here's the axar I know.,4
Back to old Axar I see.,2

50% of the target achieved in 45% of overs,2
Umpires changing the ball after a boundary is more demoralizing to the bowler than the six itself,2
Extremely Hot Take- If we don't get Nortje and Rabada asap we won't have a death over stage,3
RR looking good. Really want them to win as RCB fan,2
"Delhi, 2 quick wickets,  otherwise you're gone for",5
999 on a cricket jersey is a blasphemy,7

"I miss going to a curry house and saying 'a large Kingfisher, please'",5
If Iyer is out there is a question of bringing Hetmyer in and dropping njorte which feels outrageous but also their batting is starting to look average,11
Capitals were catastrophically bad in the final quarter of their innings,8
"Ashwin is bowling so well. 1-15 in 3. If they play him out, RR win this",6
They have to include ashwin in odis and t20 ahead of kuldeep now.,5
"Rohan Gavaskar wasn't fortunate enough to inherit the immense batting talent of Sunny, but he sure did get some of those bland-ass commentary skills.",19

Damn damn damn,4
Wtf is that shot Lmao,2

Tushar Deshpande's expression now says 'you are telling me I took a wicket?',4

That should do Tushar‚Äôs confidence a world of good. Imagine your first wicket is BC,3
coming of age test for sanjuu,6
Now Uthappa gonna play a 8(20) to gift the match to dc,2
Is that the game?,2
Steve Smith's spirit from mid-tournament took over Stokes in the last 3 overs,7
Hahaha. RR botching this up,1
Sanju‚Äôs wicket and we‚Äôll have the edge. Come ON!!!,2
Rohit vs Kohli IPL final this year (if Iyer is ruled out),3
I don't think this is a good strategy from Ponting/Shreyas. The two must've seen how Sundar/Chahal strangled a deep batting order in the 8-14/15th over. 11th over and Ash has bowled 3 and Axar is getting piped.,2
Only the lord can save them now,2
You fools really thought RR couldn't bottle this one?,7
"Great slower ball that. Very RR if we fuck this chase now

Also very RR if we tuck the chase then Tewatia hits 20 off the last over to win it",9
Run a ball godammit,2
That shot was never gonna be a six,2
Required rate of 7.5 and you play a crap shot like this,5
Where them stokes fanbois at,1
How big was that Samson six?,1
When you have a decent opening batsman then why would you make stokes open knowing your middle order is still a little fragile.,2
Pls somehow be a no ball,3

At least I can go to the shops now,6
Dhawan :- i am the captain now,2
Inb4 Delhi regret having Stokes out because Lord is incoming,6
Robbie U here to stink it up again lol,1
ok guys utthappa in we can still winnit,10

"**10.2** Deshpande to Stokes, OUT, Deshpande holds his own against a batsman intent on dominating. Stokes jumps out of the crease, and he bowls a slower one at 121ks. He is way early into the shit, and ends up holing out to long-on. Deshpande is over the moon **86-3**

BA Stokes c sub (Lalit Yadav) b Deshpande 41 (35b 6x4 0x6) SR: 117.14",1
Ben Stokes last match: Gets out to Khaleel. This match to new man Tushar. He is truly vocal for local,11
Uthappa should not be coming in at 5 imo,3
"Every ad involving cricketers ever

‚Ä¢ An overseas cricketer saying something in Hindi

‚Ä¢ A cricket pun

‚Ä¢ cricketers in groups of three/ solo cricketer playing an unnecessary character",7

Stokes played decent. Smith is the clown here.,6

***KKR fan's PTSD intensifies***",9

Deshpande holds his own against a batsman intent on dominating. Stokes jumps out of the crease, and he bowls a slower one at 121ks. He is way early into **the shit**, and ends up holing out to long-on. Deshpande is over the moon  

Cricinfo getting a bit informal!",7
Thala innings from stokes,5
Uthappa tuk tuk,1
Good wicket by desh ka pandey. I hope he's good but I'm getting discount Unadkat vibes from him.,2
"Fuck sake Benjamin, I just got back from the shop and turn on the match to see you walking off

Only seeing Lord smack some 6s can make up for this",5
DC should take this as an opportunity to replace Iyer as the captain. Guy has the best players in his arsenal and imo hasn't done justice with it,0
"Uthappa taking a further step in running his career, daring to come in against DC bowling",1
Lalit = Rohit sharma minus Vada pav,6
What exactly is the point of playing Uthappa at no 5. They could atleast play an extra bowler or an all-rounder,1
Scenes if robbie wins it for rr,7
"I love Stokes, but I'm happy to see him go",2
"Still have some overs of Nokia and Kagiso as well as one from Ashwin, we‚Äôre fucked",3
Uthappa once for god's sake play a sensible winning innings.,1
OBSTRUCTING THE FIELD BC /S,3
Bro uthapa looking like aparchit,1
Lol that throw,1
"Didn‚Äôt deviate, he‚Äôll be fine",3
Don‚Äôt get Uthappa out man come on.,2
"Uthappaa.. Uthappaa...
You can do it Uthappaaa..",3
Robin Uthappa is so wasteful when he's not opening.,5
Uthappa didn't look back right,4
"Tushar looks really short because he isn't a 6""5 fast bowler but he's probably no shorter than 5""10ish. Reminds me of lil Jhye Richardson",4
"Players need to learn from sachin, he never played aerial shots unnecessarily.",3
"If Uthappa can‚Äôt win this for RR, he might as well retire",6
Wasn't that obstructing the field?,2
Gandu,1
Uthappas role is anchoring the innings and making sure the team doesn‚Äôt collapse,2
Not out I believe.,1
Uthappa that's not nice you know.,2
Robbin Uthappa - running his mates out since 2007,6
"Stokes does his job, leaving it for Samson and Jof to finish it off with a few hits",6
Don't see any foul play,2
Don't think he changed path,3
"The umpire didn't have to shrug fifteen times, we know  you're clueless bro",9
People complaining about a collapse rn need to remember that the Lord works in mysterious ways,7
If you don't have the vision of the ball then it should never be a out.,9
That's not out,5
Thiccboi Uthappa digging his own grave lol,1
Can‚Äôt give that,7
As a DC fan I am desperately hoping this is not-out,11
THAT WAS OBSTRUCTION,2
Not out,6
"Not out, wasn't even in the line of stumps",6
Appealing obstructing the field. SMH ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,10
"Nah that's not out

DC about to lose fair play points lmao",9
He changed his line,-3
Delhi shouldn't even have appealed that.,4
That can't be out,5
Not out.,3
Out,2
"To quote the chuckle brothers: 'oh dear, oh dear oh dear'",1
How do u judge that,2
He's Inside as well anyway.,2
Robbie Uthappa seems like that uncle whom we have to give batting out of pity and respect,7
Looks innocent,3
Should be safe. Didn't change his line,3
That is a really unethical appeal from a team having Ashwin smh,9
"Previous obstruction dismissals: https://www.iplt20.com/video/21822/m65-kkr-vs-pwi-yusuf-pathan-out-obstructing-the-field

Ashwins team always finds new and ethical ways to dismiss batsmen,9
Bad call Ump,-1
ffs Uthappa just go out yourself and your team will win,4
Not out rr gonna regret this,2
"It's not out.

He's not changed it.",6
Not out,2
Scott styris is being stupid.,6
Surely you can‚Äôt give that out,9
Imagine appealing for that,8
Obstructing the fielder dismissals always remind me of Inzy's vs India in 2006,9
Uthappa should be given out for obstructing a T20 match with Test batting.,52
That was pure unintentional.. but shit it was Uthappa,16
Fair play intensifies,4
Hope RR pulls a KXIP here...,1
"I mean, doesn't matter how the throw is, he can only throw it one way, and he ran straight down the middle",3
Never out for me,2
"As usual, DC finna end up at the bottom of the fair play table, not that it matters...",6
He changed his line slightly in the end,3
"give it a rest, the guy‚Äôs gonna get out in a few balls anyway",5
Not out actually benefits DC lmao,8
"That was very clever running, got himself in the way without changing his line",18
He does run on the other side,2
The only memorable Uthappa innings I remember is his 12(12) where Rohit scored 264.,9
[deleted],-1
should be out man.,-1
"It is Uthappa, DC should make him waste more balls before getting him out.",8
"As a neutral observer, and as someone who likes Robbie, still think it was out",0
If uthappa doesn't perform today...he should just retire...,2
For a second I thought it was Mohit who's bowling but nah it's the new guy,6
fuck my life,2
Rotate the strike with occasional boundaries and the match is RR's,1
Thankgod Uthappa is on strike,1
samson go all out mate,2
Fools. If Uthappa wanted to speed the chase up he would move out of the way and get out.,3
Unethical running. Ashwin unhappy now,2
Lmao this reminded me of Lord Yusuf pathan kicking the ball out of the way to avoid getting run out,4
DC fans shitting on Uthappa as if he's Rahane,7
Rr is bound to lose now. Fuck you smith.,2
Pls stop that fucking siren.,3
Good over.. nevermind,1
Wtf is this sound again üíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ,2
DC should be disqualified from fairplay points table for this appeal lol.,1
Can we count on uthappa to make the match csk levels of interesting?,0
Tushar yaar,4
Uthappa take a single pls,2
Goddammit that no ball sound will give me heart attack one day,11
They are really ponting's team aren't they.,5
I was using my phone and this fuckin no ball Siren scared the shit Outta me,8
"CRR:8.1, RRR:8.0, RR in last 5 overs: 8.0",1
If Dhoni would have done this ww3 would have started,17
Fuck all,1
That was nice plot point. Cool writing,5
All that effort for nothing because Uthappa will get out next over.,4
Looks like tewatia will get to finish another game,4
"Shit 4 but i""ll take it thanks.",2
Hope this match brings back Uthappas form,2
"Comms making it out as if he deliberately ran in a way which would block the ball, as opposed to it simply being the quickest way back",11
166 strike rate from Uthappa. Fuck you r/cricket lol,7
Uthappa got a nice chance to free his arms.,2
Bowling no balls with Shardul-esque bowling should be criminal,3
Yeah let's go mallu boys take it home,2
From ball boy to no-ball boy,3
"The quality of Indian fast bowling is quite poor in the IPL for a long, long time.",3
"*Uthappa turns around and runs*

Doully: Wow, incredible 5D backgammon chess with x ray vision to anticipate where the ball would go and sense the atoms move to run a direct line to block the stumps. Incredible",13
Some day there will be a missile inbound from North Korea and I will miss the warning thinking it is just the no ball sound,8
We're doomed. Even uthappa and unadkat are looking good against us. Fuck this.,6
Really strange field placement. RR scored 30 runs behind,3
Thappad maara Uthappa,4
"Buttler and Stokes are the key to England‚Äôs middle order which has been the team to beat in LOI‚Äôs.

RR be like ‚ÄúHey, let us use them as openers instead‚Äù",8
Why was it not out exactly? Am I missing something?,1
just take a wicket more,1
RIP to earphone users,3
Who is captaining DC now,2
Robbie's pre-season booty-fication paying off,3
"But Harshal was bowling so well, why replace him?",1
"In a game so tight, that free hit could be the difference",2
And Ponting warned Ashwin against Mankad LMAO,1
"Looking at Ashwin field lol, how are we going to manage Gayle fielding.",3
Didn't RR get a wicket last year just like this for obstructing the field,1
Just take 7 more wickets and DC will win.,2
Young Uthappa would have smacked it out if the park.,5
Literally don't understand a single ACKO ad so far.,3
Man run rate is well under control tuk tuk all u want for a bit,3
"Inzi bhai straight bat defence

Lovely memory of obstructing the field. ü•∞",5
Lol that no ball felt like a physics teacher denying a break and continuing with his lecture,4
Why‚Äôs styris taking it so personally?,3
Who is making the bowling changes????,3
[deleted],12
"what is you doing bringing in axar rn, ashwin should've bowled his final",4
When was the last time we had a close match ?,2
Quarter century for Sanju!!,5
RR not that far off the RRR.,5
"Samson will go Halla Bol when and if he reaches his 50.

Edit: fucking jinxed it",6
"Honestly, I have no problem with an appeal. The umpires can look at the slow mo and make their decision. No one is getting out unless its clear they tried to cheat, why not ask the question?",3
Even our lower middle order could make this. Tyagi did way more damage than I initially thought.,3
"He did change his direction which should have been straight, and not across coming in line of the throw, that is out..",0
If they had to get utthapa why in the first place they let go rahane,2
idk what but im soo sure rajasthan will find a way to bottle this.,3
Uthappa run out kararga sala,0
Do you think the script writers have a redemption arc for Uthappa? /s,4
Guys where is manan vohra y rr playing this dead weight uthappa?,2

Thank fuck,3

Uthappa coming down the track in 2007 style. Alas it results in edged 4 not mid off four now.,6
Bhag bahut khel liya.,2
"Armer. So simple, yet so effective",1

"ah yes, time for a sweet sweet collapse",6
Fuck yeah.,3

The Samson hype train has to be stopped,1
Just missed a straight one lol.,1
cOnsiStaNcy,5
"lol, sorry axar for doubting you. You beauty",3
Only lord can save RR now,1
Brilliant.. Axar is our MVP this game.. scored few runs and now a wicket.,6
"Okay enough bullshitting, summon the Lord now",12
Yo wtf,2
I miss Mishy already,5
"And finally, the real chase begins now.",12
Tewatia from behind the scenes: Do you really need me for this too?,19
Shaabaashh Baaapu!!,2
Samson ffs. I was about to praise the lad just now.,3
"There would have been a huge debate whether Uthappa deliberately changed the line while running back, but it was Uthappa he doesn't matter to anyone except the rule book purists",2
*Mark Nicholas voice*: Now then,8
Tewatia incoming,2
Lord Tewatia incoming.,2

Waiting for r/cricket to shit on Robbie cuz he gave sanju the strike,9
"**11.4** Patel to Samson, OUT,  **97-4**

You can thank me for memeing axar back to a wicket,9
"arm ball shmarm ball, samson missed a straight one!",2
DC to Fans- EASYEASYEASY,2
Yes. That's how Axar comes back. Suck it Samson.,1
"Axar to Samson: *look at me, I'm captain now*",2
How many balls do RR need to do this in to cross KKR's NRR?,2
Unlucky samson seemed he learned his lesson with his stupid shots.,2
Remember when people wanted Samson to play for India because he scored a couple of 50s on a school cricket ground?,2
Mishra on these slow wickets would be beautiful,2
Samson is RCB personified,3
I wish we had played Lomror...,1
Young Ravi Shastri has the wicket,3
Such bad shot selections are causing sanju,3
Sad for RR,1
Are they really going to throw this away? Surely not.,2
Okay so the no. Of times I've mentioned Mishy a wicket falls,4
Oh no chances of DC winning the game reduce to zero with this wicket as the Lord is coming to the field....,7
SaMsOn ShOuLd pLaY fOr InDiA,5
Most inconsistent batsman,-2
RR are spectacular at choking. They have a good alternate career at Brazzers.,2
90 percent of mallus  have the same facial hair as Samson,3
"Enter Lord Tewatia

Edit: Nope",7
Samson is performing better than expected.,3
How did Iyer get injured. is it major or minor.,2
Any update on iyers injury?,2
Axar getting the last laugh.,2
My god i just plugged my headphones in as that wicket was taken and my head has nearly exploded,5
The match bot must be supporting rr with that rcb flair,1
Sanju tu ghar ja.,1

parag looking too cocky for his own good. this is gonna end badly for him.,-1
"Samson is so like me. Goes hard in the very beginning, enjoys, doesn't last much.",5
Parag over lord? Doesn't sound good,2
Yes Doully get in there with the United slander go on,2
why does it feel tingly down there when that pic and stats of jofra in on the screen?,3
"Wtf that isn't Lord

Who is this false prophet",3
Is it Tewatia time yet?,1
Where is Lord Tewatia?,2
Onion Uthapam > Robin/Robbie Uthappa,2
I think Akshay Kumar needs to star in the biopic ‚ÄúRise of the Axar‚Äù,5
They can win this match with singles and occasional boundaries if they don't fuck this up.,5
Is this Axar's best IPL in a while? He's been darn good! 6 wickets @ 20.16. Economy is 5.62!,8
Loving this ManU slander lmao,8
"Someone just bet him he couldn‚Äôt get Alex Telles in his first sentence

Wtf was that lol",2
Can we take a moment to appreciate Dhawan's inspirational captaincy,8
Patel to Samson: Pehli fursat me nikal,6

MIDDLE ORDER CHAOS ENGINE INITIALIZING,2
"Surely RR cant fuck this up from here, can they?",3
What happens to Sanju Samson from the 2nd game in literally every season?,8
"If you ain‚Äôt talking Tewatia, I don‚Äôt want to talk",8
"Uthappa can have an amazing cricket media career after his retirement. He is articulate and understands the game.
Infact he can start sooner than later",9
Parag is huge for a 18 year old Indian kid,6
How tf does Rajasthan all star top order make it look so hard to score,5
"For all the people asking about the lord, it's giving time to parag to get set so he can shine equally when lord enters",4
My boy Robbie well on his way to make majestic 13(15),6
They can trust Lord Tewatia even if the RR is 36,9
can tewatia face nortje?,3
Lord have decided to give his disciple a chance,7
I'm getting nervous as we get closer and closer to Tewatia.,6
Shit... Tony stark is alive,3
The ManU diss in the commentary box lmao,0
Even if Pant not playing. Samson 0 - 1 Pant :),9
RR top 4 is a JOKE,5

Can't wait for Lord Tewatia,6
"Sigh, Smith and Samson and Butler. Great batsmen, but not for us now.",3
63 from 48 should be fine tbh,4
Ah... going for the kill here with Nortje,2

Will Robbie get a redemption thread today?,6
"Yeah get fucked Nokya, this is our local legend Uthappa",5
All this is only leading up to another Tewatia masterclass,5
Fast af boi back on. I'll have 151 please,5
X rated???,4
I dont get it. Why bowl slower balls when you can bowl at fricking 156?,8
I can see Robbie is out there with an intent,3
Still is RRs game unless they botch it badly,5
r/cricket with yet another memeing player back into form ?,8
Chad Uthappa,2
"Completely off-topic but I saw a video on RR's Twitter with Jos and Smudge where Jos says ""I don't think either of us are the best looking"". I desperately need to know whether Jos actually doesn't know he's the sexiest man alive",10
how come no one calls for smith to be replaced as captain like they do for dk? he hasn't had a great ipl so far.,27
Rabada still has 2 fyi,1
Shit,1
"Man am I craving for a close finish, hope this game goes in deep",1
Oh wow...,1
Just joining in... I see that Devereux has not hit a purple patch in this IPL...,2
How's Robbie doing it,1
Don‚Äôt anger Nortje bruh,2

Uthappa redemption arc coming,5
Bowl kagiso ffs,1
"It seems every year I choose the wrong team. RCB, DC and now RR",7
For some reason spinners seem to be doing really well this IPL.... Slow tracks of uae perhaps....,6
this match isn't good for my heart,9
I'm sorry Uthappa. I underestimated you.,3
"Nortje is focusing too much on speed right now, might work against parag and other newbies but not Uthapa",2
Kannum kannum nokia?,3

"Riyan Harris , Welcome to Vada pav club",4
When is lord tewatia coming on ?,2
"I wish Nortje went ""fucking move knobhead"" after he took Buttler's wicket",11
Rajasthan need to win to keep this tournament alive . They have too many super exciting players to languish playing dead rubbers after falling out of the race .,25
I hate these interviews during a tight game,14
Perfect set up for tewatia,9
Uthappa would walk down the pitch and whack Nokia at his peak,11

"Uthappa the magician:

Watch as I make our chances of winning... disappear",5
Bloody hell Royals!,2
No dancing for you today buddy,5
Goshhh RR makes every game so clutch lol,1
"I'm sure they've done that on purpose to bring tewatia out, literally no other explanation for trying to run that",8
Damn man Axar has really impressed this year,3
Lord Tewatia pls save RR again,0
Parag looked like he was going to murder Robbie,11
I'm tired Robbie!!!!!,3
The Lord is here. Lord Tewatia.,6
Parag should've Bihu danced his way in to the crease.,9
"Thank you Robbie, you‚Äôve brought in the lord at the right time",5
"Uthappa: I'm not the Lord, I'm the devil",4
Uthappa to Parag - Chal kone kat le.,1
wtf yaar,2
Tewatia and Jofra still to come with RRR below 8,2
"Cometh the hour, Cometh the Lord.....",1
Uthappa is utter shit,3
Insert ryan reynolds ‚Äúbut why‚Äù gif,5
Who tf thought spending money on Uthappa would be a good choice for RR?,7
Robbie you better finish it off today for that wicket....,4
"They knew they won't win this game, that's why they danced before the game.",6
"Parag was gonna be out even if they went for a run, but smh Uthappa",7
Ashwin vs Tewatia will be tasty,5
"Terrible cricket all around

Parag not wearing any form of headgear as well, deserved it tbh just for that",2
The real game begins now bois,2
Dinesh Karthik and Uthappa are two serial run out specialist. Players on non striker end should always watch out.,7
Kya plan hai?,3
Uthappa running out Parag so the Lord comes in. That‚Äôs 5000 iq,12
Nice to see a direct hit by someone other than Jadeja.,7
Parag could have burn down Uthappa with that stare.,7
They should fire up the boundary WWE style whenever lord Tewatia arrives to bat,10
our lord and saviour,7
Finally the lord has arrived. Saddle up boys,3
Riyan was not the imposter.....,8
This is so funny,2
Can buttler or stokes lead a team? Its so painful to watch smith bat.,5
Wickets in hand will win it for rr,3
"Uthappa stopping the bowler twice now, fixing?",4
"Dread it, run from it, the need for Tewatia to rescue RR still arrives.",12
Lmao we gonna lose today. I had more faith in Parag than Uthappam,8
The lord has entered the field,3
What the fuck is happening here,1
Aur nach bhosedike - coming from a salty srh fan,3
So many examples of bad running between the wickets this IPL. Is it all the fake crowd noises?,3
Even Munaf Patel used to field better than Prithvi.,9
You can either save RR or NRR,8
I have been constantly worrying about Rajasthan's chances. But now Lord is here. Pray he be merciful.,8
Parag was so pissed there. Can't say anything since he's a youngster in the team. Uthappa better score some here,20
Today DCs balling is shit,3
Ngl im a little scared,3
"Tewatia to be the hero again, we all know the script",8
"Off the topic, but never understand point of visa and MasterCard ads on TV, I am not going to go and fight HDFC bank that I want visa debit card or MasterCard debit card.",13
Looks like a Uthappa day unless Rabada gets him,5
Jadeja-esque direct hit by Jadeja lite,4
"In cases like these, the scorecard should say: ""RUN OUT \[UTHAPPA\]""",9
I dunno what ti say about this RR batting line up,10
"Cometh the time, cometh the man ~ *Lord Tewatia*
 
(I totally stole this from day before yesterday's thread)",2
"Uthappa isn't new to suicidal runs. He had GG at the other end as his partner for a long time in KKR.

Actually one of the reasons why they were good tbh. Was ready to run them selves out in the PP in order to get the strike moving!",8
"Before stokes came, Miller could‚Äôve been tried",4
I can see uthappa winning the match and doing the bihu dance.,11
Lord will smack the shit outta Rabada today,12
Oh great now Uthappa is undroppable,3
RR calling on Tewatia heroics once more.,5
"What does ""wicket getting slow"" mean?",8
RR can still lose if they do a CSK,6
"still an easy chase, even Archer could chase it. If only Carey and Stoinis managed 10-15 more runs",10
Lord Tewatia to RR top order be like - FFS can't you guys win a match on your own for once,18
Still think that is part of the Robin Uthappa redemption arc,6
They can't wait to go deep because of the 2 Rabada overs left. Get a few runs now and they can safely play out Rabada. This is a good move from RR,5
Lmao uthappa performing after 2 fucking years is peak 2020,7
LMAO. Runs someone out and then a forward defence to a ball. 9D chess by Uthappa,8
Uthappa to send all other batsman home because he will do it alone today.,7
These chokes that RR pull off sure must be super entertaining for both the opposing team fans as well as neutrals,9
saala ye batting khatam kyu nahi hota hai,10
First good game in a while,5
dc now going to mess about in the field to create run out opportunities. the kind of shithousery i can get behind.,11
Bowl Rabada now. Best against their best.,9
"5D chess by Uthaapa, to bring in LORD. 
It all requires a different perspective to see",15
"Go for the kill and bowl Rabada ffs

(Also for my fantasy points)",11
"3 overs from Rabada and Nortje, this could come down to the very last over.",12
Scenes if Robin manages to do the same with Lord (‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª,3
"Cortell, Rashid... Rabada next for lord?",2
Robin is doing alright. But he better win this,2
"Would you rather bat with Parag or with the LORD?
So pls be considerate towards uthaapa pls. It was a 5D Move",3
*the triangle of pace* I love it brett,2
Robin uthappa should be banned for sabotaging his team,0
uthappa shouldve sacrificed his wicket. atleast parag has some runs under his belt. robbit hasn't been in form for 2 years now.,-1
Am eating onion Uthappa with pudina and coconut chutney right now ‚úåüèΩüëåüèΩ,9
"Lord ""awwww sheeeet here we go again""",6
"win win for me, either delhi wins and my team has a chance, or twat gives us another blinder",4
"Fucking sucks to see David Miller warm the bench. got out for a platinum, yes platinum duck on his first and only match because of the cursed pitch. 0(0) for David Miller, he deserves better.",14
Uthappa better win this now. We need to see parag dance at the end or we riot.,4
What is the opposite of a choke? A cheeky blinder?,2
Loved how Axar took an extra split second to aim that one.,5
"6 overs remain, my guess 2 to Rabada, 2 to stoinis, 1 to Nortje and 1 Ashwin",1
Rajasthan's matches are great to watch as a neutral.,8
"Lol, Uthappa has played his one obligatory inning per season which makes him undroppable for the rest of the matches.",10
It's an easy chase tbh. Commentators are just playing it up so that we stay tuned in,7
Lee talking about the triangle of pace,14
Whatever happened to trying to change his own name to Robbie,10
I swear if we defend this the first thing they should do is make Shaw watch Iyer's acting for 10 hours just as the punishment,40
Archer and Lord Tewatia deserve better team than this.,8
"Fuck, Lee's gonna get Rabada to mess up his action",14
"You fools thinking RR will play out Rabada's overs

The Lord does not care what reputation the bowler may have, he will send them to the fence regardless",30
Just a reminder DC scored 32 and lost 4 wickets in the last 5 overs.,11
"If Uthappa can't win it for his team from here, when there's no real pressure of rub rate, i think he seriously needs to think about his career options.",9
"‚ÄúThe bigger the triangle, the better the pace‚Äù

Wierd logic but it‚Äôs Brett lee so I will trust it",23
Got to learn your geometry in order to be able to bowl fast. Who knew!!,9
"Its about time top teams get fucked, come on RR",3
I knew Illuminati was real and this triangle of pace definitely confirms it.,11
Wtf is Bret Lee blabbeering. Triangle of pace?,-7
What's Smith been upto? He's been very shit...,3
"As a Delhi fan this match is too Close for comfort, as a cricket fan this match is what an ideal match should be",6
Lord Tewatia gonna rip apart in second last over of Rabada. Confirmed,9
"\*chase exists\* 

Uthappa : I'm going to stop you right there",6
"The Google live win probability has Rajastan at 60% haha, if Tewetia gets out it'll drop to 0.5%",3
"If we win this, it at least means that the batsmen are starting to hit form. Stokes was good today which is crucial for us. Buttler got out to an incredible delivery. Even Uthappa seems to hit his strides

But Smith...what to do about Smith",5
Bret Lee with some rocket science of fast bowling. Good stuff üëå,8
There are IPL ads. And then there's Kamla Pasand,15
"Unless Uthaapa wins it for RR, can see him Bihu dancing his way out of the team",7
Game defining over incoming,2
Terrible choice by shreyas,1
Anybody else have issues with Star Sports Select 1 HD?,1
That stokes wicket was the turning point imo. There was no need for that shot,2
"2 overs of rabada and 1 of ashwin. with these batsmen, idkkkkk. if stokes had put 20 more runs on the board, rr couldve won this.",1
What tf happened to Smith?Why can't he score runs now like the earlier 2 matches?,3
"Why is Tushar bowling another? Surely you go to Stoinis, Ashwin, Rabada & Nortje",1
Is Shikhar being the captain,3
Rabada will beat the crap out of Tewatiya,3
So if we get Tewatia out do we automatically win? Cause it's been proven that if he stays RR automatically win.,5
"Personally I still think that if we have Uthappa in the team, he should be opening and Stokes should be batting at 5 where Robin currently is now",2
"This is exactly how DC lost the last match vs MI

Using Rabada too late",5
I feel like a heretic saying this with our lord and saviour out there but it is rather likely that RR's gonna choke here,1
"You should blame Parag also, blindly running",0
Come on Tushar,1
Ryan Harris said Tushar Deshpande is a good death bowler. Would love to see him doing good day.,3
Chutappa doing chutappa things,1
Ah time for Altroz wankfest,2
Mc Tushar how many extras do you want to concede,7
Just gotta get through the initial slump of 10-20 balls and then Lord Tewatia can unleash his energy without killing anyone,2
They should have shown Shardul's action as well just for laughs,4
It's crazy how cricket humbles you. One day you were doing the bihu dance after the match and another you walk to the dressing room pissed off about a run out.,9
"Slats told me he loves crank, strange music choice tbh

Oh wait sorry he said Crack",2
Would you rather bowl out your best by the 19th over or bowl one more from the spinner?,2
"Rabada & Tushar : 2 overs remaining

Ash & Nokia : 1 over  remain",6
"Buttler
Robin
Smith
Samson
Stokes
Parag 
Tewatia
Archer 
 Should be the batting order.",2
Get rabada in and get these 2 out ffs,5
They better not leave 12-15 runs for the last over.,2
Rabada is still miles better than nortje and Archer. Why would he then need to increase his pace?,2
Can the lord please spare us today?,3
Is Iyer back on field or is the injury serious?,4
"Sothappa, Rahane, Vijay, etc need to form a Useless XI

Sothappa
Rahane
Vijay
Jadhav
Piyush Chawla
Vijay Shankar
Gonadcut
Maxwell
Sid Kaul",6
NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!,3
Thank you Nortje I love you,5
Nobody can catch Lord,11
Lmfaooo,4
Nortje giveth nortje taketh,11
Nokia... Come on mate.. can't drop the Lord like this..,15
You don‚Äôt drop the Lord and get away with it,24
Did you just put down the lord?,11
That dropüòÇüòÇü§£,2
You dropped the lord,8
Our fielding is utter wank,3
157 kmph incoming,10
The Lord gets caught when he wants to get caught.,21
Nortje has dropped the match? That was such a shit shot though.,5
I want Tewatia's fortune in my life,5
Dropped omg,2
That was a fucking sitter lul.,4
The Lord can't be tamed,3
Aint nobody gonna catch lord tewatia,3
Not that easy to get a hold on lord,3
Come onnn smh,2
Nokia dropped the Lord.,3
That was a dolly.,2
calling it. Tewatia two reverse sweeps off rabada's last over,4
ffs,2
Divine intervention for the Lord,4
"Lord will only get out when Lord desires, petulant mortals won't get the job done.",5
Nokia blinded by the lord's aura,3
That's a big drop,3
"nortje I love you and cherish you, but rot in hell crapface",5
The lord is saved,2
Bruh that was the match,5
"Lord gives you once chance, you drop it, it‚Äôs over for you son!",5
"One does not give the Lord a second life and survive

If you come at the Lord, you best not miss",7

Ricky Ponting about to break some fucking arms,5
Dropped the match,4

Wtf bc,1
Wait why is iyer sitting out?,3
"(Batman) Robin should have opened with Jaiswal...
Smith 3,
...the rest are ""finishers""

Last comment: Smith does not look like a decent man manager.",2
Its funny hearing foreign commentators pronouncing Tewatia's name. Its a bad word in Tamil.,7
Why don't DC bowl rabada here to make the match more interesting?,3
Fuck me,2
"A little late, but Uthappa knew exactly what he was doing. More evidence of the batriarchy.",1
One simply doesn't drop a lord,4
"Mark Nicholas: *Taking guard is Lord Tewatia*

*He's Lord Tewatia*",3
The commentators always say ‚Äúsafe pair of hands‚Äù when a foreigner drops lol,2
"Of Course the catch was dropped, he's a God you're a mere mortal",5
"You drop LORD, you drop the match",4
How to lose a match 101!!,3
Deshpande bowling at decent pace. Nice to see that,2
"The lord's generosity is mocked, thou shall not hath that fortune again

Tewatia 14:8",7
"Uthappa is spot fixing
1) Tries to get Samson run out
2) Stops Axar Patel twice during his run up as a sign for fixers or something
3) Gets Parag run out
4) Playing way too freely, trying to get out maybe?",7
Ha ha. How dare you getting lord's wicket on first ball? Doesnt happen mate,9
Ahh the delhi special,3
The universe have spoken. It's RR's day. Cant fight luck.,6
The ball phased through his hand because the Lord willed it,7
"Wait, shreyas not on the field? Who's captaining?",4
"Tewatia might be the Lord but is he the gold standard, the safest music box on wheels?",6
Tewatia make em regret that drop,7
I think the slide let him down. Had he been on 2 feet he would've pouched that,3
Nokia dropped that because of tewatias immense presence,8
"He didn't drop the lord, the lord made him",12
"I mean, why would you want the SIN of getting the LORD out",12
Shreyas sitting in dugout clapping with both his hand acting injured because he cannot handle the pressure with tewatia on pitch.,5
Just dropped the match!,4
You dont take catches when sir tewatia hits it straight to you. That's the law of cricket.,7
"Nokia just didn't want the wrath of the Lord

Understandable",5
Nokia wants tha Pointing Spanking‚Ñ¢ real bad,6
Gote muh me aaye the,7
Dropped the Lord,3
Who is Ishant Sharma‚Äôs doppelg√§nger sitting with Iyer?,1
How is Nortje = Nokia ?,3
Imagine bowling 155+ only for a dropped catch to be the highlight of your day,10
Nokia lost us the game,2
DC need to work on their fielding. If we make it to the playoffs we can't be doing this.,6
"Drop the lord, drop the match",12
Delhi just dropped the Cup.,6
The way of the Lord works in mysterious ways,2
Damn where is that cameraman who used to show punters reaction after every blunder. We need him now,7
Uthappa playing a beaut here. Seriously.,3
Feel Dhawan wears a shirt one size lower to make his biceps seem bigger,13
Should bring back Swann in dugout commentary now so that we can here Tewatia's name every two seconds,8
My god he dropped The Lethal Weapon. That was the game for DC.,6
Hi just joined. Why is Shreyas sitting out of the game ?,2
"I have 2 questions

1. What is the purpose of life?
2. Why is stokes opening and utahppa in middle order?",33
Nokia fuming inside. 160kmph deliveries incoming!!,1
Tushar Deshpande's pace is goodüëçüèΩ,2
The Lord works in mysterious ways,12
"When lord gives you blessings, you're supposed to accept it with both your hands. If you reject the blessings, be ready for divine punishment.",11
Tewatia getting Memed and being called LORD n stuff is all fun. But deep down we want him to play well. He's earned our respect,39
I want dc to win but also another glorious innings by the Lord - oh what a dilemma.....,2
RR getting nervous at the prospect of winning against DC,2
"Nortje gonna unleash his anger now, 160+ confirmed",9
"Wow Tewatia, it is like Royals don't want to win. smh",5
Rahul Dravid and Robin Utthappa attended the same school,6
Listening to Brett Lee talk about how to bowl faster sounds like any measure a bowler takes to soften the impact on his joint will cause him to bowl slower. No wonder fast bowlers don't last that long.,4
I fr read rahul tewatia as lord tewatia,7
Nokia saving Shaw from Ponting spanking,15
The Gods favor him,4
I'll add that to my list of Lord Tewtia divine interventions.,9
The RR and target are so easy that Rajasthan will win this despite their best attempts at self sabotage.,10
"Lord Tewatia: Bodies are perishable, but the self is eternal. Praise be the all pervasive and indestructible soul.",8
"Archer is good for 10 (3), j think RR have this",7
I see Lord Tewatia training his shots with Smith.,2
[deleted],4
Imagine buying 5 Indian pacers none of whom can cross 140 km/h at a time when there are multiple young Indian pacers who can cross 140 km/h. SRH management for you.,7
"Punjab, stop the hype train for us",1
I want to see archer smacking some out of the park,5
Lord Tewatia favored himself there,3
anyone else ready for rcb to find a way to lose to punjab tmrw,8
Uthappa is playing 5 star ea cricket with 0 confidence. Nothings been timed.,2
Tewatia should have been out 0(1). Arguably Uthappa too,1
Just finished eating utthappa eight now. Umm delicious üòã I love dosa and utthappa,3
Binga with the gold on the dugout . Although kg has had none or close to no injuries compared to any other genuine quick bowlers in recent years. that triangle of pace is very exciting but it might put to much load on your foot and over time cause severe injuries. even steyn had a similar front leg position to kg if i‚Äôm not wrong,6
why am I still so scared bruh,6
[deleted],8
Super over,4
Just bat till 20 ffs you meme characters.,1
So DC about to lose 2 games in a row with next match against rising CSK? Ummmmmm,1
How did lord tewatia become good? Always get confused between him and Rinku Singh.,1
Was Iyer injured during batting or fielding?,1
Ethical vs THE LORD HIMSELF,3
AAJ HAMARA HAGGNE KA PLAN HAI!,1
Who is that man??,1
This over will decide the winner imo.,2
Can we see Ashwin Mankad lord tewatia,1
Just see out Ashwin,2
6666.6,7
how tf was DC still ahead of RR here,3
[removed],7
Tewatia will smack the loving day lights out of Ashwin like he did to Rashid,1
Guys. Kya plan hai?,2
Tewatia shirt for swanny lol,2
Kingfisher's olalellelloloeoe is the best ad ever,5
Tewatiya might get run out,2
Swann :(,1
Is hotstar acting up?,3
Swanny with a Tewatia shirt. That‚Äôs true love right there,3
"After Cottrell and Rashid, is Tewatia going to destroy Rabada today?",6
I wanna see ashwin mankad lord tewatia,2
[deleted],3
I need that shirt swann's wearing !!!!!!!!!!!!!,3
Haha Swanny finally got his shirt,3
"Swanny is a character, just love him on duggout.",7
Tewatia doesn‚Äôt hit spin well. Hence Ashwin,5
"They had to get 14 out of the tushar over, rabada incoming boys",1
Tewatia's kryptonite - off spin,7
Why is swann all out for RR?,3
Tewatia trying to do a Tewatia?,5
Swann is a madlad,5
ASH ANNA NO WARNING ONLY RUNNING HIM OUT,6
Find a girl who backs you the way Swanny backs Tewatia,5
"Ashwin, tell em",2
Ashwin stop time wasting,3
Did Ashwin just warn uthappa or did I imagine it?,14
Don't mess with Ashwin imo,2
Lord reminding ashwin why he is the lord,3
Tewatia respects Ashwin.,3
Shit talking all around,3
MANKAAAAD,3
Did Ashwin give him a warning,9
"We're now behind the RRR, not good.",3
Is this Tewatia guy any good at batting?,1
Tewatia struggles against spin,8
"No one: 

RR: Initiate self destruct",18
tewatia is charging his ult rn give him a couple minutes,13
Just play out the over Tewatia.,3
"Commentator:  :spots the sponsor car (that he'll never drive in his lifetime because he's too rich for it) on  tv:

Commentator: I love that car. It's the dopest shit ever invented by humans. It gives me orgasms at night.",20
Ashwin has the mankad in his head too much. Uthappa hadnt wven got close to starting to leave his crease,8
It seems Lord lacks ethics.,7
Lord is powering up through dots,10
4 Bindi Gend,1
Is tewatia drunk today,3
Tewatia preparing for a tewatia,16
Lord setting us up again,7
"I really hope that this is part of Tewatia's master plan, it's making me really nervous",13
Ashwin is a fucking legend,8
Tewatia treating Uthappa like a kid,8
Fucking Ash is god level,9
Don't do anything silly against Ashwin now rahul bhai.,1
I've supported Ashwin's Mankading. But if you do mankad the LORD. Ashwin I'm sorry,4
Lazy Scriptwriter reusing tewatia story /s,9
Ethical mind had lord under him all over,2
People are gonna bring on offies whenever Tewatia shows up now.,3
Tewatia wanted to get off strike so bad,3
Ashwin has been fantastic this IPL.,7
Hmm so who‚Äôs gonna go for 30?,1
That over could be the game changer.,3
Tewatia farming strike,-1
Ashwin is so good.,3
Tewatia protecting Robbie from the strike,0
They should bring Rabada next over to build on the pressure created by Ash. Hope they don't screw it up.,2
Sounds weird but that‚Äôs a good over for RR. Ashwin‚Äôs last over so important to see out,3
They better score 15+ of Deshpande because what's left is a Rabada and Nortje onslaught,0
Top class bowling by Ashwin..,2
Ashwin!!!,1
"2 KG overs out of 4, though he seemed out of nick today can't really count him out at death",0
The Lord works in mysterious ways,2
I don't wanna doubt the Lord but I think this over mightve decided the match,0
This game has entered the Tewatia Zone‚Ñ¢,2
Last time tewatia slowed an over. ..... I'll just leave it here,3
Excellent from Ashwin,1
Are RR gonna pull a KXIP,4
Lord playing his obligatory dots,1
Ashwin is superb in T20s. He's got to make it back to the India team somehow.,0
"Should have rotated the strike, gonna bite in the back in final overs.",0
Tewatia dont do warm up before the match he does it in the match only,-1
Only RR can bottle so bad,-1
Smartly done. No point going after Ethical Boi.,0
"10 runs from 2 non Rabada overs, smfh",0
Its clearly intentional from ashwin. When the bowler can see the batsman is clearly not ready he shouldn't bowl. Did with smith multiple times and smith had to stop him again and again,1
"BC Robbie, when Lord Tewatia says run, you run",5
Tewatia defending against Ashwin only to attack against ...Rabada?,3
I am glad stokes took the singles he could in the start. Or else Uthappa would be destroyed by now,1
Ashwin is op,2
They need Automatic Emergency Brake,3
"Chase looks increasingly difficult, 3 overs of Rabada and Nortje",-1
"(read on another comment)

How lord plays cricket:

Step 1: make opponent think they r winning for the first 37 overs

Step 2: do a tewatia",6
Ashwin has been Excellent this season,4
I don't know why India kicked Ash out of limited overs team,4
Rabada please rip apart,3
Plebe commentator fails to understand Lord is charging up and foolishly thinks he is under 'pressure',2
"There have been many pretenders to the throne, but Ashwin is and continues to prove that he is the consistently best all-format spinner in India.",12
Why is Ashwin not part of any of India's white ball squads? Too good a bowler to miss out on.,2
30 runs from Rabada's over?,1
Umpire: Lord please don't make me reprimand you,5
"if tewatia can take down kg, we really have entered the wildest timeline.",2
Ashwin single-handedly imposing legitimacy of mankad rule.,7
Rabada bowl some yorkers mate,1
Lord will destroy this pretender called Rabada,3
Been wondering who is that baby Ishant next to Iyer?,1
"Smart move to bring Ashwin into the attack to either get rid of Tewatia and/or dry up runs from the left hander. Things are now going to be difficult with Rabada and Nortje to bowl, going to need to target Stoinis if he comes in",2
"How fuckin good has Ashwin's spell been , in this match.",2
What have either of these teams done to be at the bottom of the fair play table,2
Csk still at 3rd lmao,2
Stop shaming people with a smaller triangle of pace,2
"""Triangle of Pace""",1
Ashwin _/\_,1
next nortje or deshpande?,1
DONT FUCKIN DIVE KG,2
CSK at 3rd lol.,2
Tewatia facing too many dots... And we all know what happens when he faces too many dots...,6
bitch they could‚Äôve run a single there...,2
Uthappa about to make this match interesting,2
Now Rabada will do RR's Demolition,1
My dad just said 'Out' loudly for no reason before the ball was bowled,8
"Wish they'd just do away with the fair play table tbh

No need for it and it adds nothing to the tournament",2
If Uthappa stays DC has hope,2
Uthappa ko bowl pila do,0
Don't get injured Rabada doing those impossible attempts u are our only chance now,4
This is a good test for Rabada.,4
So they did dock CSK points in the fairplay for what Dhoni and Shardul did yesterday. Colour me surprised.,3
Looks like RR has fucked this whole thing up,2
Pressure.,0
RR are botching this,0
Not worth diving for Robbie's wicket kg,0
"Surprise surprise, CSK is still 3rd in the fairplay table and got 10 pts from last game üòÇüòÇüòÇ",8
"Rabada be like ""feeling cute might take a wicket or 2 later"".",3
Lethal should wait till last 2 overs.,0
anyone but uthappa. ffs this coulve been close otherwise.,5
Just call it the upside down triangle.,1
Yo the two bastmen are not happy w/ each other,1
KG no wickeys so far.,2
Agent Uthappa keeping DC alive,0
Uthappa played that before Rabada even bowled it,0
That is not what i meant when i said play out ashwin lol. Now play out rabada and launch when rrr is 28. Thala style.,-1
I see many people doubting the Lord. Don‚Äôt celebrate with us when he pulls it out the bag,1
Will this be the match where Rabada goes wicketless,2
Ponting needs to train them on tricks not to get run out.,0
They're putting the pressure on now. Almost 10 required,0
Swann and Scotty really pissin on that triangle of pace theory,10
Swann is cracking me up today üòÇ,4
chUthappa looks out of touch,-1
The Hypotenuse of Heat,8
"Maths banter on dugout, peak times lol",9
"With each dot ball, lord powers up to another super saiyan level.",6
Dugout talking geometry is so hilarious,8
What part of the bat did it hit?,2
honestly don‚Äôt get uthappa out bc then u have to deal w daddy jof,1
Uthappa has all the confidence of a toddler trying to poop without diapers.,12
My heart comes in my mouth every time a DC player dives,7
You still have the Deshpande over.,1
It's becoming more difficult now. They have to hit a boundary this over.,4
Ashwin should be back in the LOI squad. Kohli can suck it,9
Uthappa having zero clue,1
Will Ashwin ever get a comeback in LOIs?,1
Genuinely hate how KP tries to make everything sound like the most exciting thing in the world,0
Uthaapa edging it like it's England. BRUH,0
Why don't they just try to hit? Who are they waiting to target? They have archer and gopal after this too,-2
Unadkat scored 50 points on fantasy league today lmao,3
We might well be witnessing Uthappa's last cricket match,0
"I don't care if DC wins or loses, I don't want to see a wicketless Rabada",5
Uthappa middling the bottom face of the bat,2
Lord tewatia two sixes c'mon,2
Uthappa has no clue playing express pace. He's just swinging and praying to the seven gods that it connects,3
Ffs Uthappa don't use your tummy to play,3
It takes special kind of mediocrity to play that Uthappa pull shot,3
"Bhago bhago bhago bhago - tewatia to uthappa

He's seen Parag perish and learnt quick. Respect, Saar.",2
Lord on strike.,0
Bhago bhago bhago bhago....!,0
Uthappa is looking like a real fish out of water,4
Uh oh here we go,2
Thats how i would bat against 130kmph bowlers,2
Rabada looks PISSED,1
alright Lord Tewatia,2
one four this over and they cool,2
Fuck... Tewatia can do anything,7
What a shot. This is South Africa's premier bowler.,4
Tewatiaaaaaa,3
RCB vs new RCB tomorrow,4
Clever Lord,2
The lord giveth,4
It‚Äôs starting,3
Dc win by 6 runs,-2
"No matter where your fielders are, the Lord will find a gap

Lovely shot",4
Rattle his stump mah boi,3
PRO GAMER move by Tewatia .,7
The lord is my shepherd üòç,10
Of course he did that,9
Praise the Lord,8
Shot Tewatia let's go,2
"dhawan is actively captaining, that‚Äôs it . Can‚Äôt take dc serious no more",-1
Hail,3
"Tewatia upper cutting Rabada and leaving him shocked, what is this timeline lmao",16
LORD!!!,1
the nonchalance... just Lord Tewatia things,4
uthappa is really bottling this spectacularly.,3
The Lord works in mysterious ways,4
You don't even need to hit boundaries. Plenty of doubles will decrease the rub rate considerably.,8
The last time Rabada went wicketless was 21 innings ago. Today he‚Äôll go wicketless again most probably.,6
Tewatia time of the day.,2
Lord has now reached super saiyan blue.,3
"Robbie is so consistent, hitting the toe with every shot",8
Tewatia teeing off here.,1
This wouldn't have happened if Nokia took the catch,6
That's the LORD right there.,4
Daddy Tewatia ARgghhh!!11üí¶,3
The Lord has got this in the bag,6
That was a work of art,1
Delhi fans we are not bottling this we should be thanking our stars for even getting to this point,1
That's sex,0
What happened to your Yorkers KG?,5
Delhi must‚Äôve watched hours of tewatia batting to find some kind of weakness,3
Lord forgive me for I've just sinned,6
Lord decided RR are not worth his time,7
Tewatia has taken the entertainer in chief role from Russell,8
üôèüôèüôè,2
Lord Tewatia: *Kabada* who?,11
"Uthappa: gets even the slightest amount of bat on it

Lord: bhagobhagobhagobhago (runrunrunrun)",14
Sachin Tewatia,5
"Thanks for nothing, Nortje",3
Tewatia is fuck all angry with Robbie's denial of single's,9
Tewatia sees all world class bowlers as gully bowlers.,7
Why is Uthappa not running??,6
Fast and full,1
Just want a super over,1
Rabada forgot that he can bowl yorkers?,6
Can't see how the lord gonna be able to hit against Rabada nad Nortje.,-1
Deshpande's over will decide the game,3
Playing Rabadas last ball with respect is some 8d move by lord,3
So Deshpande now or Nortje?,1
Lord treating KG Rabada like a KG student.,8
"Who will win this match?

A. RR

B. Lord


*No mistakes have been made in the creation of this poll*",10
Why fear when Lord is here,3
Next time we select a Indian team Tewatia should be ahead of krunal pandya in preference order.,3
AND YOU WILL KNOW THAT MY NAME IS THE LORD WHEN I LAY MY VENGEANCE UPON THEE,3
"RR is the only team to hit Rabada at 8 RPO in their last two encounters against DC, today Rabada has given 25 with one over to go.",1
I'll be sad if Rabada breaks his 21 game streak today.,9
"Nokia now, Rabada again

Keep Tushar at the last",3
My guy. Very clever shot selection once again,2
[removed],6
Great shot rahul. Go RR,1
Smith should be sacked for no contribution dafuq,2
"Mutual funds ,sahi hai",2
"Bc the day I make rabada vc in fantasy, he has to fuck it up",1
Tewatia looking more susceptible to Robbie's run calls than Rabada's bowling,2
Why is uthappa playing? Shouldn‚Äôt that young left handler be playing instead.,3
Who will chris gayle come in for?,1
"No dot balls , no dot balls.",2
Will Tewatia do Dhoni 2016 or Dhoni 2020,2
Do not piss off the Lord uthappa,0
"Tushar Deshpande's over will be interesting. He does well, DC may have a chance with Rabada and Nokia overs.",3
Nokia? So Tushar will bowl after this one probably. Rabada for the last over.,2
Why can‚Äôt RR back Yashasvi instead of Robbie ?,2
Scenes if Tewatia wins this from here and Robbie doesn't do shit once again,2
Rabada's 2 wickets a match streak may be coming to an end,1
Super over coming?,3
Nokia has a chance to redeem himself,2
Not sure about the game but Robbie might finish his career if RR is unable to complete the chase.,3
Tewatia false prophet,2
"RRR nearly 10 now, of course we still have Jofra ""ABD"" Archer still to come but even with the powers of Lord Tewatia I fear that this is still going to end up as another senational bottlejob from Rajastan.",3
Pant would've stopped that smh,1
Anyone else thinks Nokia is good looking ? ;),9
Tushar to bowl the last over? :-/,2
Is Uthappa a cat?,5
Bhago bhago bhago bhago. ..,2
128 Lmao bowl spin Nortje,2
The ball should only hit Uthappa...,0
Carey has been rather unremarkable with the glove,1
Robbie get out and let Archer in ffs,3
Stoinis for the last the over,1
Runs shouldn't be leaking like that at this point,2
Ffs Carey,2
Tewatia acceleration phase against the best bowlers in the world has started,5
This match is so  much fun for neutral viewers. MAN!,7
TFW you realize Swanny is being paid to shitpost.,7
Why didn't DC bowl an over of Stoinis earlier? Deshpande is a young lad playing his first IPL game. He'll be under a lot of pressure bowling in death overs here. Hope he does well.,3
Tewatia with the bhago bhago,3
"Carey is so poor behind the wickets, making Pant look great. Should just make Hetmyer keep next game",1
"Not 160, is  130",0
Uthappa is doing well and nobody talking about him UwU ü•∞,5
That scoop shot is exactly how I would play and think of myself as ABD.,4
Buttler has a sexy nose,3
Bhaago bhaago bhaago,2
Uthappa thinks he is Butler. Cute,3
Nortje will clean 'em up easy peasy,1
csk at 3 lmao,1
Chennai still doing good at fair play after that Dhoni and thakur fiasco yesterday.. what a sham,3
Fair play award is wack,3
"Pant didn't die for this

What is this, Carey",3
Imagine how much Pant would‚Äôve been cursed for that misfield,3
Grab a screenshot of that fairplay table for post match masala üòÅ,4
Tewatia dug a hole by not taking singles in that ashwin over. Back him to get this still though.,5
"Lol, how is CSK 3rd in fairplay?",8
Lord Tewatia,1
">In IPL 2020, Rahul Tewatia has a strike rate of 91.3 against spinners as compared to 171.3 against pacers.   

~ cricket.com",2
Fixer kings at 3rd such a shame to fairplay,5
Lord has the neutral face that someone who lies on their resume but still gets the job has... and yet he's one of the few actually performing. Huh.,2
Haha I think rr lost points after the tewatia tantrum in rrs last match,3
Of course CSK's still near the top of the fair play table,5
Chennai got 10 FP points yesterday. Just saying.,4
18th over is lord's over,2
STFU crowd with the fake ass chants,9
Rr should try to finish it before the last over,3
Pant looks like a baby hippo,5
Robbie needs to be dropped. Also downvoter's mom is a hoe,10
Lord can't do shit against serious page,4
Nokia has been expensive today,4
"What a spin, Lord Tewatia true Spinner",9
Stoinis to bowl the last over,5
Damn amazing fielding from Rabada,10
Tewatia bhai kya chal raha hai,3
Clutch hand Rabada,7
Uthappa changed his name from Robbie to Robin and you can clearly see the difference,3
Jos Buttler and Bradley Cooper are one and the same,11
I'm convinced uthappa is not out because DC don't wanna take his wicket,4
Dont bowl pace and in the slot to Lord.,2
CSK fan here but Rabada I want to give you forehead kiss for that save,5
Rabada made that look so easy,7
Swann loves the Altroz more than his kids,8
Kagiso Rabada is secretly Ninja also.,9
Swann is on something very strong,5
They showed Altroz Swanny won‚Äôt die now.,7
"Gabbar is the stand-in captain, not ashwin. Surprising",6
Uthappa is just horrible running between the wickets. Damn.,8
Rabada using a ball magnet in his hands.,10
Nokia's pace will be too much for tewatia.,5
Nice,2
How tf did Rabada get his hand on that lol,9
Swann cramming the ad in 3 seconds like the Mutual Funds Disclaimer,4
Lord showing his power right here....,2
RR seriously needs some clutch here...,3
YORKER FUCK YE,5
The difference in physiques between Iyer and Pant is so stark.,9
You can't catch the lord,6
Tewatia + altroz = Swann boner,7
NOKIAAAAAAA,5
NORTJE OHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHO,6
HELL YEAH NOKIA 3310,10
Net positive for RR,3
bring out archer,6
Tewatia can spin the bowl even when batting,14
Nokia has redeemed himself,3
Rabada did great,3
"Thank you, now bring Archer in ffs",2
Fuck... Send Jofra to end this,6
"Jokes on you, Archer coming in",7
Hahaha.. charging a 150kmph ball..,13
Oh sweet yorker,3
Hat trick incoming,3
So is Stoinis getting a bowl?,3
nortje fuck me in the ass,7
this is not 2007 robbie,8
Nortje breathing pure FIREEEE LETS GO DCCCC,9
Now jofra can cunt the ball.,10
AGHHHHHH.....We are done. Aren't we?,6
Too quick for Chuthappa,-1
Give him a guard of honor lmao,1
Yessssssss,2
Shaw still waiting for that high-five,2
How did Rabada just pluck that out,4
"Nortje is pronounced Nokia

Imagine if Mukhesh was pronounced Pankaj",2
Too good,1
The guy is leaving rockets at 150+ and you bitch tried to jump out and hit him?,7
DC probably dismissed their best chance at winning. Archer is a bigger risk than Uthappa,6
Well yorkers work... Who knew,3
LMAO uthaapa really thought he had a chance coming down the track üòÇüòÇüò≠üò≠üòÇüòÇüò≠,3
RR is losing a match they should‚Äôve won. lol,4
Prithvi left hanging lmao.,4
"**17.3** Nortje to Uthappa, OUT,  **135-6**

RV Uthappa  b Nortje 32 (27b 3x4 1x6) SR: 118.51",2

Blackheads - gone
Uthappa career - gone",6
Got Fielding by KG,3
"Archer is gonna finish this, isn‚Äôt he?",3
throw this mf Uthappa out of the team,5
What a choke.,5
Yorker at 150. Unplayable stuff.,6
RR fans eat Kamla Pasand,9
Say goodbye to your cricket career utappam,3
Good riddance,1
"Thank you for your service uthappa, we‚Äôll see you directly in the auction now",6
God damn he's fast.,1
Shaw denied a hug by Nokia,2
3310!!,2
How sad Uthappa‚Äôs career has become,3
Lmao dugout commentary really taking dig at altroz....,3
"This dude is faster than Archer, omg",8
"Hold me, big man Jofra is coming and he'll be our end",3
Great fielding by Rabada. Underrated af.,8
dc fans should not be cheering. u have to face two overs against jof and the lord.,2
We are winning this!!!,1
Running towards someone bowling at 150 KMPH?? Smart. /s,7
oh no.,1
Oh Nokia you beauty!!,5
"Ran Parag out, ate up balls and did not finish this. Uselesspa",5
Super over coming guys.don't go anywhere,2
WHY would you POSSIBLY go down the track to someone bowling 150 kph?,4
All over to tewatia now,1
Best thing to happen for RR,1
Nortje express.,3
NOKIA IS INDESTRUCTIBLE. FUCK OFF ROBBIE,2
Jofra about to taste his own medicine,1
Full Plate Utthapam served,3
"Mark my words, this Nokia dude is going places.",3
rare moments where both sides are happy,4
Uthappa no chutney,3
This is why I love cricket,1
How do you scientifically explain something like Tewatia's current run? That much luck match after match is just some meme energy,2
Ahum open with yashaswi jaiswal next match,1
"""I believe Nortjes is the fastest bowler in the world currently"" - B. Lee",6
In comes Archer,1
Butler already showed you what happens when you don't read this guy. Robbie with a completely dumb approach to a chase that doesn't require such stupid shots,6
"And NOW the game is lost for DC, the two Lords on the field",4
If Nokia had taken that Tewatia catch this match has been over by now..,2
Oh shit. Joffra will destroy Deshpande,3
both Nokia are reliable and unbreakable.,2
DC just lost the match.,2
"Full, fast, straight reminds you of a fajita? Wtf? Maybe that's why I can't bowl fast üòî",1
"Lord is not interested in saving these useless mortals ass anymore :( 

Please show some mercy on us lord",2
Keeping Uthappa on the pitch was the only way DC could have won,2
"Why the fuck are all our games the same formula?

Top order fails, middle order saves, middle order dies and The Lord rescues us once again!",4
Robins effort to run down the pitch against 150kmph is comedic,3
"Nokia: **Signs Nokia as brand ambassador**

*Now this is what I call a pro gamer move*",3
Archer first ball six incoming?,2
Jofra up next,2
Nortje breathing fire üî• üî•,3
"Bowler is bowling @ 150kmph!! 

Uthappa: I am going to step out and smack him.",9
Get this pensioner outta the team,2
There goes our campaign.,1
"Lol. As if the ball was not coming fast enough, he charged down.",3
RR have dug themselves in a hole here.,3
Need not more than 3 off the next 3 balls.,1
Send out Tewatia's clone you cowards,5
Nokia is 2 fast 2 furious for the rest of the batsman including Tewatia,1
"I‚Äôm not gonna lie, I thought it was Tewatia on strike and my heart died for a second",3
"Never fear, Archer to smack the fraud Nortje to declare himself the one true fast bowler",6
Uthappa's lazy running made this much harder for RR,7
Oh Robbie r/cricket is gonna eat you now,2
"Charging a bowler doing 150 clicks for fun..

Really Uthappa?",10
Uthappa to open and stokes at 5 ffs RR or get fucked,2
Uthappa is half Tewatia - there is no redemption,3
Think Nortje is comfortably the fastest bowler in the world now. Bowling 150 after fielding for 18 overs is MASSIVE,5
Delhi fans collectively sigh. Their best player is out,5
"ffs drop uthappa. idiotic buy, but even worse actually playing this guy.",6
"Nokia is fast, like really",7
Uthappa needs to retire,2
Uthappa probably felt it to be 165 kph with gow much he jumped out,5
Uthappa is done and has been for a few seasons now,4
He's bowling at 150 Robbie u need snap hands to come down the wicket to that,6
Why would you charge down the wicket to a 150+ bowler? üòÇ,7
Bro Deli is insane. This is without two power hitters. You reckon they'd have 20-30 more runs to defend with Pants and Hetmeyer.,4
SUPER OVER???????,1
Feels super tight,2
"KP ""This is excellent. Dhoni would have also done something like this. The experience of playing with him is clearly rubbing here""

""Sir, this is Wendy's""",20
Nokia = Honda.,2
Jofra Afridi to the rescue,9
somebody pls fist bump Prithvi shaw. He's having his Bavuma moment,5
Dehli's win prediction has now shot up to 70%,7
Nortje was released by KKR and then bought cummins for a hefty price and Nortje has been far more impressive than cummins.,2
I wish we could somehow make Nehra face Nortje for an over,5
"Oye Uthappa, phir se chuna laga gaya oye   (‚îõ‡≤†_‡≤†)‚îõÂΩ°‚îª‚îÅ‚îª",4
[deleted],3
It is almost as if the whole RR wants Tewatia to finish the game,7
Archer swings both bat and ball very well.,2
Tewatia is the reason this is close. 2 runs off 16th over not acceptable at all,7
"Tewatia : 9-11

Robbie : oops I better leave the scene then",8
Here comes RR's best pair,3
154.1 kph first ball to archer.,12
"So, with SK winning their match yesterday, if we lose this, we are out of the playoffs?",5
You come down the pitch to spinners not 150kmph fast bowler,5
Shit communication. They are getting into so many run problems.,7
Uthappa please never come back out on a cricket field again.,4
Robbie made this easy chase to intense,7
154 is the new normal,3
Swann was once ambushed by his enemies at a toll booth. But he survived the barrage of bullets because he ducked for cover in his Altroz - India's safest hatchback.,12
"tewatia : you face him

Archer : no u",26
why does every good t20 game end with it being 27 from 15,8
"The Robin(Hood) of Cricket, Stealing from the balls left and giving to the required run rate",13
The Lord wants to make this interesting.,7
"Rahul Tewatia has scored 21 boundaries (13 - sixes, 7 - fours) at the death in this IPL - more than any other player.

*Cricviz*",13
"Oh boy, Rajasthan is fun to watch. No doubt about that.

This could have been an easy win after 12 overs, play sensible cricket and take calculated risks.

Can't complain as a spectator though.

Wondering if Tewatia can do it once again.",10
What idiotic running is this!!,1
"Jofra almost causing a run out
KP : *Well done Jofra Well done*",5
Don‚Äôt think he can do it today,3
"Another day, another chase, same result.",4
Lord will fail today.,4
Lord gonna scoop,9
Will KP suck Dhoni's dick? ü§î,7
Delhi has always had the best of SA.,8
Is Iyer's injury serious?,2
Nobody wants to face Nortje,3
Nokia bowling faster than Archer's fastest to him is peak big dick energy,10
Yorker,1
Is that Rishabh Pant or Kapil Sharma looking on?,5
Uthappa ran out Riyan and was useless himself. Sack this guy,5

parag run out cost us the game,14
Who is the Mahesh Manjarekar lookalike in the DC dugout?,1
Nokia gonna get cunted next ball.,7
The Lord shall giveth hope to DC,10
Tewatia and Uthappa partnership was so shit,5
Tewatia can finish this in an over if he wants to but he likes to keep us all on the edge.,10

*Slower ball*",34
"LORD: The non-existent is not found to have being. The existent is not found to have non-being. However, the end of both of these has been seen by the truth-seers",4
I mean Nokia bowls a slow ball at 134 kmph....,23
"It is so humiliating, losing a match like this!! :(",3
I have been informed by my close associates that Tewatia may be a False Prophet,7
C'mon Nokia this is the time to bowl a slower ball and finish it off,1
How much of this are we going to blame on Robbie?,15
I think Tewatia is gonna get a Yorker next ball,7
Can't believe Uthappa came down the track to Nokia üòÇ,10
the key to this game will be how much they cunt deshpande,5
Love you saffas,6
"Serious question as we don‚Äôt have the Altroz over here, but how good is it?",8
Tbh nothing much utapa could have done there on that ball,10
Robbie has seen Sehwag come down to 150+ speed,7
It was a straigtforward chase if that thicc bum didn't run parag out.,13
Massive choke by RR here,12
So... Is da1 the acting captain?,11
Should replace Uthappa with Lomror. He's a number 5 and will be an additional bowling option.,10
Big over alert,11

Nortje has been our best bowler this year. Period.,8
The lord keeps the strike,3
Dhawan has captained decently till now,2
152kmph with ez,2
"Scott Styris - Michael Scott


Graeme Swann - Andy Bernard


Brett Lee - Jim Halpert",2
I'm sorry but dhawan needs to be fined for slow over rate. TF is this,1
Very aggressive field setups from Dhawan.,1
This should be Rabada's.. extra pressure in last over.. so they'll definitely do anything stupid here,3
That ball mustve been 170+ kmph relative to Robbie,6
Nortje bowling slower balls at 134 ks. Damn.,6
Tipped toward DC maybe now,3
Tewatia is consistently doing tewatia,3
Has to be Rabada!!,2
Rabada next over plz,2
"I wish there was a timeline where SA had a pace quartet of Steyn, Morkel, Rabada and Nortje",5

God damn what an over from Nokia,3
"Match winning inning by Steve Smith. Cant run, Cant score, Cant captain. Shit player",1
Worried we'll give Stoinnis the ball in the last over.,4
It was only 39 of 30 at one point.,5

This is going to be key over,2
"Shreyas must be hoping, that DC shouldn't make Shikar the captain if he wins this for them",1

You can't be kidding me if tewetia does it again against this bowling attack.,4
Get 6-8 out of this over . Can get 17 last over of the newcomer,1
What a revelation has Nortje been this IPL season. So freaking consistent match after match.,4
"Don't do that, don't give me hope",1
Big gamble to keep the youngster for the 20th,1
That Parag runout by Uthappa was a game changer. He played so well in the last game.,3
They better not go to Stoinis for the last over.,1
Jofra gonna disrespect rabada,1
Guys...S word?,1
RR has fucked this big time.,7
Not in mood for more upsets. Gotta head out now :(,2
"""outside edges that fly to the boundary"", kya chutiya baate karta rhta h.",3
Dhan tan nan.........,3
Match is a goner for RR. Rabada is too good for Tewatia's antics.,7
"Uthappa batted at a better SR than Stokes and took the match as deep as he can. He's being shat on unfairly. Minus the Parag run out, he did no wrong. Tewatia played out an entire Ashwin over, mind you. Not Uthappa.",14
So that was the major difference between SRH and DC,1
Tushar for the last over? I'd bite my nails off like Ponting if so.,4
"Rohan G: ""What Rajasthan need is a couple of outside edges which will fly away to the boundary"" 

The faq lmao",14
Top order failed RR again,6
14 runs in last 3 overs. We are outdoing worst finish this ipl in the same match.,7
Game over,1
Did the DJ just play Dhan te nan?,7
World class from rabada,3
Fuck DC don't give me hope.,4
Archer should not give away his wicket here. Just rotate the strike,3
[deleted],-2
Archer getting a taste of his medicine. Yorker incoming.,3
"Tushar gives a lot of no balls, i hope they know that",5
Who's going last over?,1
Rabada gonna go wicketless after 21 innings?,4
You can feel the heat generated by the Saffer duo even while sitting 1000s of miles away.,6
Behenchod no audience yet cameraman still finds cuties to zoom in on,8
man Archer beat the crap out of our fast bowlers in the death. It's just a matter of connecting. He is goign to catch one.,6
I am not one to question the Lord... but you‚Äôre leaving it a bit late,6
Quicker one 147                                                                                 Nortje- Those are rookie numbers gotta pump them up,9
Archer noooooo,2
I want DC to win. Why? Just see my flair,6
We need Game of Thrones song again,2
"This is just horrible from RR, I don‚Äôt know why I am even watching. Even if RR somehow manages to win, this will still be a horrible performance from RR",6
We are fucked,4
Love you rabada,3
Uthappa u fuckwit,0
Give some more of Dhawan captaincy.,5
Clutch bowling,2
This is the reason why stokes should bat down the order,3
oh maan this isnt jofra's fault. the batsmen are to blame.,3
Jofra getting a taste of his own medicine :),6
Only the Lord can save us now.,1
Rabada keeps up the streak,5
At least Rabada got a wicket.,5
Had to do it to em in the tushar over,2
All eyes on the lord now,0
Rabada is God in this over.,3
THE STREAK CONTINUES,1
it‚Äôs fine whatever I love Rabada too much,2
"you see Archie, thats how it feels like.",3
Give the strike to Tewathia!,2
Archer gone it's upto the lord himself now.,6
Rabada.. Majestic over..lovely,3
Fuck this is a choke,4
Streak intact. KG beast!,5
Reminder that Delhi also struggled to score in the last 5 overs,3
All down to Lord now,7
Heck they've bottled this. Only Lord's shenanigans can save them now,6
A choke that would make Punjab proud.,9
Is stoinis bowling the last onw??,1
Is Tewatia lining up for 20th?,2
Rabada has to end up with a wicket lol,2
A Royal Collapse,2
Rabada never goes wicketless,3
archer face like what kinda witchfuckery is that,3
Did they cross????,1
Rabada continuing his streak,2
Lol rr,1
"Just when you thought Rabada might go wicketless in 1 match, he picks a wicket.....",4
Rabada What a does Kabada!!,2
RR gotsta do something bout that regular top order collapse,6
"C   H   O   K   E

H

O

K

E",5
The Rabada wicket taking streak continues,3
Who will rr blame today?,3
Proper choke,4
Lord is present,2
Prithvi is 2 feet shorter than Rabada,3
South Africa has produced some quality paces over the years!,5
Fake lord,2
THE STREAK ISN'T BROKEN,6
We are here to win fuckers!!,2
Can Tewatia do it again?,2
24 off 8. Always going to be tough but even more so on these pitches.,3
All RR needed was a few overs of accumulation from Smith.....,6
Delhi are playing like the champions this season.  They are definitely going to be eliminated in the playoff üòÇüòÇüòÇ,3
"uthappa and stokes are to be blamed for this chase.

one is so defensive and other one cant control the aggression",2
"Fuck it, give Shaw the last over",5
Need to hit 2 boundaries from the next 2 balls,3
when you try ur best but don‚Äôt succeedd,4
"Rabada 1, Archer 0",4
It isn't over till the Lord is on his two legs,3
RABADA STREAK KEEPS ROLLING,6
I blame smith for this,5
"All the srh fans rooting for Delhi rn.

Vengeance....I mean it will help srhs chances",7
Anything over 20 in the last over is pretty impossible,6
Rabada is a freak.,9
Jofra got a dose of his own bowling + some extra and his face was like tf is this guy doing lol,13
This is over. Tewatia won't be winning this one.,6
Rabada and 21 games streak continues!,6
That stupid run out is what's cost them,5
Wtf happened here?,2
Even the lord can‚Äôt pull this off,4
Parag seen taking Robbie out for a walk,3
Imagine thinking Rabada won‚Äôt take a wicket lol,4
Lmao can‚Äôt believe Rajasthan completely bottled it. Y‚Äôall were 37/0 in 2.5 overs chasing 162,15
"KG Rabada, death overs legend.
How many wickets does he take, it's pretty incredible.",4
YES Rabada doesn't go wicket-less!,7
Can Jofra give away the strike now please?,2
Prithvi loves those hugs,3
Stokes would have been perfect here,6
Rabada OP,2
LORD Robin Chutappa cost RR this game,3
Worst captain ever. Smith consistently shit smith,7
This is fucking village from the Royals,7
Absolute bottle job by the middle order here.. should never have fallen this far behind,9
"I back the Lord to handle anything less than, say, 36 runs in the final over",7
Lord wasting Ashwin's last over really added the pressure,12
That meant a lot for Rabada. These two quicks are a dream.,8
KG Goated,2
"SRH fans rooting for DC. 

RR : and who are you?

SRH : I‚Äôm vengeance",5
Don‚Äôt lose hope in the lord just yet mates,2
Nortje and Rabada is just such a ridiculously overpowered combination,7
How on earth can a name that sounds NOKIA have a spelling NORTJE?,1
'kya plannn aee' üòí,1
Fast bowling fuck yeah!!,1
If I was Delhi management I will give rabada the 15 cr contract over Iyer or pant.,10
Amazing death bowling today.,4
Man I had so much hope for archer but once again the Delhi bowlers do their thing,2
Rahane did something useful!,-1
Such a waste of unbelievable players for RR :(,1
[deleted],0
[deleted],7
"Are these acho ads supposed to be funny, they make me physically cringe.",1
Who's captaining DC on the field? Dhawan?,3
"KP:

That could be bigger than Doni, that could be bigger than Samson's

 ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)",2
"**18.4** Rabada to Archer, OUT, Rabada has delivered what Dhawan asked for. This is nearly a yorker. Quick one. And even though it is not a yorker, there is still not enough room to get under. All he manages to do is scoop it out to point **138-7**

JC Archer c Rahane b Rabada 1 (4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 25.00",3
Is this the first time in his life that Dhawan is captaining?,1
Wear the damn fucking Purple Cap you monster.,3
Fuck you madarchod robin uthappa. Chutiya saala run out kar raya,2
We don‚Äôt deserve to qualify this year if we lose this.,4
"Can Rabada end it now,?",2
The game is still on with Tewatia facing Tushar in the last over,3
god the royals are so fucking annoying. how do they still have fans??,17
Tewatia can still do it.,3
Wow dhawan really is clueless in his field placement isn't he. Absolute circus out there,4
Twetia wicket also. Come on,0
Match over.,2
Rabada keeps his streak alive of a wicket every game.,8
Rabada and last over wickets is a match made in heaven.,7
The scenes if Tewatia pulls off a fast one,1
"RR losing it

SRH, CSK, KKR: upar kahaan jayega tu bc",6
"Well of course there was gonna be a wicket. KG just cannot go a match without getting at least one, dude's a beast",2
"Don't think this is a choke from RR tbh. We kept taking wickets pretty regularly and we're in it even at 54 from 42. And we knew scoring at the death was going to be really really tough, and Rabada+Nortje is superior to Archer+Tyagi luckily for us",5
Man it‚Äôs awesome to see South Africans dominating the bowling like this in IPL for a change. Feels like the last few previous years our bowlers have struggled a bit.,3
My first year watching IPL and I don't feel like I picked a team in RR. I feel like I picked permenant disapointment,11
uthappa is unintentionally selfish and trying to live back his glory days,3
"Anyone notice that Rahane ALWAYS has a ton of bandages/taping on his fingers?? I mean he hasn't played properly in months, is playing his 2nd t20 now, how'd he hurt his fingers??",4
Will be keeping a close watch on Nokia's career from here on,10
Ashwin's over changed the game by shifting the momentum completely.,6
"And y‚Äôall said jinx is uselsss, he got the most important catch fo the game",7
Who's gonna bowl now,3
I know this question must be answered quite a few times in this thread but couldn't find it. Why? Shreyas is sitting,7
Akshar lmao,2
wtf was that parag run out we needed 52 off 41 ffs. fuck you uthappa,4
"Game of who fucks up more continues


Last 5 overs, DC : 32/4


4 off the last 5 overs RR : 17/2",5
Go with Stoinis imo,2
Calling Cottrell,7
"If Tushar bowls the last over, it's going to be trial by fire for him against Tewatia",4
We don‚Äôt need Pant to swing our dicks around lol,6
Need at least 20 left for the last over to win,3
Piece of cake for Lord,4
This sub will lose its minds if he makes 22 in one overr.,9
All up to the lord now,7
Time to ban robin for his pathetic perfomance,4
The Lord requires 22/21 in 6...,3
Tewatia got too overconfident in that Ashwin's over with the thought that he could later take on Nokia and Rabada. I think he got humbled today.,3
I want Stoinis to bowl.. experience counts.,2
Why the fuck would u charge on a guy who basically bowls 150 consistently,5
No fucking way the Lord does it again,8
"If tewatia does it from here, I dont even know",6
In before lord does a ‚Äúremember the name‚Äù .,3
"Tushar Deshpande gonna do a Cottrell, ain't he ?",2
"Said [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/dwn0x8/ipl_2020_player_release_and_retention_thread/f7khnuf?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) almost a year ago, still believe this",5
twat 22???ü§îü§îü§î,3
How can we choke so hard like that in just 10 minutes?,3
Rajasthan KXIP Royals.,2
"Rajasthanis don't fret yet, lord over probability too high",1
This year DC or MI will win the cup. They are cut above the rest.,2
"Rr have bottled it, Jofra motm for me though.",3
Fuck he‚Äôs gonna thrash Tushar isn‚Äôt he I‚Äôm scared bros.,3
kill god,1
Smith sus I dunno man. Why doesn't he score? üßê,1
Are you ready ? Lord is here.,6
Lord Tewatia will pull off a miracle now. I'm calling it.,2
RR basically can't win if Tewatia doesn't bring his massive meme energy,2
This can mean so many things for Deshpande's career,2
Tewatia genuinely struggled today...,1
Surely the lord can't make this,3
Shit Lord retaining strike. Deshpande is fucked.,6
Uthappa man of the match for dc,2
"Damn you Smith, Samson. Added at least 10 runs each, and they wouldn‚Äôt have been in this position. Plus running Parag out",1
"If the Lord wins this, there should literally be a temple for him in Jaipur.",3
Archer should have given strike to tewatia,1
Is it going to be another Twetia show?,1
"Unless Stoinis or the kid does a Cotteril, this game is done.",1
dhawan‚Äôs captaincy is a huge surpise. Ponting would be proud,2
RR: Time for NRR,1
"Feel bad for Archer, all that hard work bowling undone by your top order failing",2
Our fucking bowling attack is way overpowered. Batters have to start doing something for them for a change and not just rely on them for saving our asses,1
"If lord pulls it off, damn!!!!!",3
Tushar please get wrecked mate,2
Tewatia's turn to deny singles,3
Just like Dhoni taking it to last over and it becomes a shootout between himself and the bowler,3
From 71 off 60 to 22 off 6.,6
No Tewatia special tonight üòî.,1
The Lord is going for it,2
"Lol, we have no hope in hell of competing against the top teams",1
We have bottled this massively,2
Man! that paint ad and kareena. ‚ù§Ô∏è,1
No Lord show tonight?,2
Its gonna be Deshpandey,1
Only the Lord could win this,2
"Would you believe it Tewatia once again has the task of salvaging a win , not even shitposting here he is definitely a player RR would hold dearly in the upcoming years.",7
Guys idk why I still have hope but I do.,3
"What is the Lord going to do now? 
Walk on water or turn it to wine?",3
how to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory,4
Super over,1
Can the Lord do it again?,2
Could Tewatia do it again? Is his plot armor that good?,1
fuck this Tewatia is going to do it isnt he?,4
No balls please.,0
Tewatia be like now is the time to become super saiyan,3
Cheeky no ball first please,1
Needed 39 from 30. Now 22 from 6. Absolute God-tier bowling from Rabada Ashwin and Nortje,9
Where was this DC against the fuccboi eleven,2
Uthappam should've run himself out.,2
Tewatia gonna flop,2
Has Lord left it too late,1
It's amazing. They needed 39 of 26.,2
CHOKE,1
Can the lord rise?,1
"I understand Uthappa not being great, but he still got 32 at a SR better than that of Stokes. Why isn't tewetia taking any blame for his 11 off 14?? He played out an over of Ashwin.",1
Ha the fina countdown playing in the background.,0
Superover please,0
"If Tewatia wins us this, I'll personally give him a blowjob",5
Plz no wides and no ball,4
Too many extras given by him this match.,2
"You know, Tewatia may still win this by smashing Stoinis or Deshpande or whoever, but he may just have killed the game by being defensive against Ashwin.",2
"Smith, Samsung, Buttler, uthappa bunch of clowns.",2
"Tewatia pull this off, its better for us if you win",2
The final countdown playing in the ground. Notice.,2
That was not at all a wide,2
That wasnt a wide lol,3
Needed Dhoni there!!,0
"Man don‚Äôt look at tewatia to win u this.. If there was Riyan on the side, it would have been much better",1
Might be too much for the lord to do,0
Deshpande is the main character,3
I thought I was an atheist...,1
Lord works in mysterious ways,1
Absolute scenes if Tewatia wins it from here on.,5
SRH says hii to RR,6
Come on Deshpandey. Don't fuck it up,4
Tushar bc,1
"Omg that‚Äôs the real ‚ÄòPlay Bold‚Äô move right there

Balls on DC",1
Close call,1
A noball would be fun,2
Rahane op,5
No Dhoni to turn that wide around /s,4
Just bowl Ashwin's 5th over and deal with the consequences later,3
FUCKING SAVED US THE MATCH JINX YOU BEAUTY,7
"Butler, Stokes, Smith, Samson, Lord Tewatia himself. RR have an incredible batting line-up. Why are they struggling so much?",2
Why do chasing teams rarely win?,5
insane effort üíØ,3
Would he have given that call against Dhoni?,2
If only the Lord had played 5 more balls going into the last over,3
Why not stonis? he is last over specialist for DC so far,3
Wow,1
RAHANE YOU FUCKIN BEAUTYYYY,7

"Shreyas Gopal asking for a third, i want this level of confidence",6
They ran 1 lmao,8
RAHANE REDEMPTION,4
"Mumbaikar Ajinkya Rahane takes a catch with his fingers pointing upwards. 
Sunil Gavaskar is seen with laser eyes and steam coming out of his ears.",6
Why didn‚Äôt they run 2?!,1
"Stokes looked so good. But he should bat at 4 or 5 and need to be there at the end. There is no one better at finishing games. 

That said impressive bowling performance from DC considering how good RR were batting initially. If Samson/Stokes had stuck around for another 4/5 overs then RR would have coasted home. But everyone chipped in. Nokia/Rabada/Axar/Ashwin and even Deshpande did ok.",7
LMAO only a 1,4
RR are asking for too many miracles from the Lord.,5
WHAT THE FUCK????? ONLY SINGLE,3
Just wow jinx,3
Ffs there's too much pressure on tewatia every mtach,3
Fuck off shreyas Gopal,11

LMAO riyan‚Äôs face there,6
"The last time Kagiso Rabada went wicketless (4-0-59-0) in an IPL match - was in 2017 against SRH. Since then, in his last 22 games, he has always managed a wicket",10
That is some fucking lazy running,2
Gopal is truly a gopal. Lmao didn't run,10
They ran only one ? What a fucking joke,7
"What the heck Gopal you denied tewatia second, you could have sacrificed yourself atleast",8
Can Gopal Redeem?,2
Fuckers ran just 1 now u deserve to fuckin lose MCs,10

"Man, I have shat on Rahane- The T20 batsman but he has just won the game here for Delhi",3
3 sixes reqd from the lord for a super over,1
That's some of the worst running between the wickets I've ever seen.,3

Match losing innings from Tewetia tbh. Killed the momentum with that over from Ashwin.,10
This match had one of the finest death over bowling by both the teams.,13

"Also, obligatory, Back on Top of the Table Baby :)",3
Good captaincy by Dhawan overall,7
Gopal has been such shit. But bully for us!!!,8
Disappointed but hard to hate on this DC team,19
RRCB,12
Some credit has to go to Dhawan for his captaincy in this match. He rotated the bowlers well and the fields set were aggressive which built the pressure on RR in the last 10 overs.,33
Just 25 fucking runs in the last 5. Big L,9
Tewatia has terrible cricket IQ. Every time he hits the ball in the air he just stands there and stares at it. Fucking run mate,83
Great debut,4
Well deserved wicket for Deshpandey.,3
Ricky ponting: get fucked shane warne,16
Biryani delivered to Delhi successfully.,16
Hhahaha wtf RR. How did you lose that??,4

RR ne udta teer liya,2
And i thot kxip were chokers...,3
What a selfish innings from Lord Tewaita.,7
Rajasthan lost it when shreyas gopal decided to retain strike,6
So fellas.... We did it again. Got victory from the jaws of sure defeat. Nayi Dilli,2
The pain lord is going through after batting with 2 shitters,9
RR should have chased this down what an awful choke,4
If dc can win that I don't see how they lose anything,5
"Supreme bowling Performance pulled off by DC, truly commendable",2
"Absolutely shocking from RR despite the death bowling, there was a point in this match where all they needed was a run a ball",9
I'll say it. That was a bad innings from Tewatia.,15
"Lord is still not out, mind you",12
Man so happy for my boy Tushar. Mast last over takli re mitra,8
one of the best death bowling performances,1

Let‚Äôs gooo,6
Fuck RR and your fucking lord..cunts,11
Nortje for motm,1
"Fuck off RR,seriously just fuck off,you don't deserve to play the match ,this team should be banned in IPL,this team made me lose all respect,shitty fucking choker team.Stop with the Lord Tewatia thing,couldn't hit off Ash.",7
I feel RR has Deccan Chargers syndrome,4
Thala Tewatia today,4
Dont blame this on poor gopal and tewatia. Smith is useless as a batsman and the RR management is dharavi level shit.,11
5D chess by Tewatia - this will force the upper order to take more responsibility,0
Rahane saving that Six made the difference in the last over.,9
Ponting is so happy..,5
 News but not-so-news: DC almost qualifies for playoffs,5
RR just got wracked by DC's pace battery,7
Excellent last three overs from the three quicks,4
Tewatia went from Dhoni to Thala in one match,14
"The Lord gets another red-inker, what a legend",4
"Tewatia giveth, Tewatia taketh",9
The Lord is fair to everyone. Today he played an innings an honor of Thala.,12
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH DC!,5
Australian fight shown here,3
So happy for Dhawan.,1
We have a third seamer now! Yay!!,0
Unreal death bowling by DC.,6
Deshpande looks the part. Bit rough but definitely a lot of potential,4
Punter is so happy Lmao,7
Seeing punter happy is so wholesome,7
[deleted],15
Happy Ricky!!,1
"I am starting to think this Shreyas Gopal might have issues in deciding how to run between the wickets 

Two blunders in one over.",3
That must have been the funniest thing to happen this IPL,9
Tewatia pulled a Thala.,14
Dafuq Ponting you weren't this happy even in 2003 and 2007!,24
Lord was let down,-1
Fucking clutch from Deshpande,5
Dhawan ma boi amazing,2
Fuck yes let's go DC!!,1
"Considering RR have won a couple matches they shouldn‚Äôt have, it‚Äôs ok that they lost one they should‚Äôve won",4
"Anrich Nortje

First 5 balls : 16 runs

Next 19 balls : Just 17 runs and 2 wickets

World class.",7
Tewatia's over vs Ashwin changed it. He deliberately blocked 4 balls in a row. RR were ahead of the required rate up until that point.,4
"What a bottle job

&#x200B;

HAHAHAHA",2
Have been saying..Hate Pointing as a player..Love him as a coach,5
Ponting has brought his mentality to this side.,4
Anjinya MoM for saving that 6 and keeping lord away,4
As poor as the KXI chase this. Uthappa is as much to blame as the top order. Trash batting.,2
Uthappa and tewati could easily end it early but we‚Äôre playing tuk tuk in 16th over,3
Fucking how.,2
Yooooooo Rajasthan found a way to lose this! Such consistency :(,2
"Man we clearly had this,wtf happened? Did DC just pulled a tewatia on us? So this is how it feels...",12
Bowling saved us from under par scores 2 out of 3 times,7
Tewatia 14(18) derailed the hype train,9
"**19.6** Deshpande to Gopal, OUT, slower short ball, and Deshpande has his second wicket with an attempted ramp going nowhere **148-8**

S Gopal c sub (Lalit Yadav) b Deshpande 6 (4b 1x4 0x6) SR: 150.00",1
Deshpande us perfectly capable of competing with Harshal for that 3rd Pacer spot,3
"Fuck RR, I'm supporting DC now",12
It's fuckin awesome that we were able to defend 161,5
Who's ready for rcb to fuck up tomorrow?,2
Still can't get how srh lost to rr,4
"Saddened....

Raised hopes for nothing after last win.

No mega auction this year right ?! Let's hope best for next IPL(will be soon)",4
This is on smith 100% and he knows it. will be tough for RR now to make the playoffs.,6
"So lets say RR out...KXIP out...we have kkr srh and CSK fighting for 4th spot...
Lmao CSK still into the race",4
How the hell did that happen,7
Wins like these will do a lot of good to a team's confidence.,6
Awful innings from Twatia,9
Is this the best ever bowling attack in the history of the IPL?,8
"RR fucked this up, including the Lord",7
"Rr gonna join the ""choke me daddy"" club with kxip?",4
Bruh moment,1
Tewatia absolute stinker 14*(18). Maybe he needs those 19 balls to get going.,11
Stokes wicket was turning point. No need for that shot at that time.,3
Delhi‚Äôs bowling ain‚Äôt no joke,5
Why are RR so hell bent on opening with TWO FINISHERS When thier finshing is literally the weakest ( no disrespect to the lord but even he needs a partner ),9
Even the Lord can't measure up to Ethical Mind,6
RR shockingly let down by top order. Just not on!,8
Match winning inning by smith. 1(4),8
Embarrassing that SRH lost a match to this RR team,9
"Nortje is my Motm, Buttler was the most crucial wicket",6
I've just been wondering - what's the point of not shaking hands but bumping fists (using the bottom part of the fist) if you're going to hug right after?,9
uthappa running out parag was the key moment,6
Idk what you guys are getting angry at. Lord is still not out.  /s,2
"Ootl, is Dhawan captain?",2
The lord giveth the lord taketh,2
if DC doesn't win the cup this year...,4
"Everyone will say give Nokia MoM, but it should be Ashwin or Axar, they didn't give an inch in the middle overs and choked them out..",8
"Last 5 overs 25 runs. Excellent bowling by DC.

Adding one more great bowler, this should be illegal.",12
This is punjab level of bottling of a chase here.,4
This was a pure bowlers game and don't even consider a batsman for mom,5
It would've been crime to not let Deshpande take a wicket on his Debut. That guy bowled fantastically,7
Absolute death bowling. DC lads deserved this.,7
Reminds me of a punter interview ‚Äú we fucked up as many times as any other team but we always found a way to stay in the game come back and win ‚Äú,5
RR last 5 overs followed the same script as DC last 5 overs,4
"We can meme Lord bla bla bla all day, but Lord wasting Ashwin's last over was the turning point.",15
Tewatia not out with 77.77 strike rate lmfaooo,9
Tewatia strike rate looks awful now,9
The blasphemous thing was some posters here including the dugout wrongly assuming Lord has cheated by obstructing the field when it was actually Gopal.,10
"Tewatia's innings now in retrospect looks bad, thus is the curse of ""play deep"", finally he also got his bad one",13
The second innings was an Exhibition for Fast Bowling.,8
should do a lot of good to the Lord‚Äôs bloated ego,20
disaster stuff from rajasthan. they should lose 2 pts for losing this considering they were 85-2 at half-time and going at 9 rr.,9
Great death bowling,0
Smith plays only for moneyyy,-5
Sothappa and Kunju Samson need to be dropped. Useless fucks who can't finish matches.,4
The lord works in mysterious ways,-1
Record for scoring least runs in the last 5 overs has been broken twice this match. Woah.,12
"To the fucker who said DC will finish with same points as CSK, a special fuck you mister!!",12
"Gotta feel for Gopal, Tewatia and Parag. Deserves a better team.",8
Swann is such an entertaining bloke,7
"Absurd to blame Tewatia here when top order has regularly been shitting the bed. If he had proper support like Parag, he'd have done it.",28
Robin is a scamster,5
Lol I thought csk was playing shit cricket and they are not even in last three,3
This team has come a long way. From choking 26 of 24 with 7 wickets remaining against KXIP last year to winning this kind of game!!,13
delhi made an amazing comeback with that death bowling,3
"This sub : OMG can't commentators stop sucking on Dhoni in a non csk game


Also this sub : let's collectively shit on Dhoni even in a non csk game",10
"Well, doesn't look like Rajastan are finishing any higher than 7th this season. That was a sensational choke after having the game more or less in the bag. Tewatia did win us two games with his batting but he probably sealed Dehli's victory as soon as he played out that 2 run over from Ashwin, it was always going to be too much to try and take on Nortje and Rabada.",15
BEST BOWLING ATTACK ON THE TOURNYYYY LETS FUCKING GOOOO DCCCC,8
"I get that the last 5 overs are meant to be the death overs when everyone slogs fearlessly, but I feel too many teams are underattacking the weaker bowling options in the middle overs. You can't expect to attack Bumrah, Rabada, maybe Narine etc. in the death, have to pick your bowlers earlier.

edit: overs not years",9
We almost lost this. Not to jinx but our bowling is great.,14
Fuck yes! Super game for us!,8
Make buttler the captain,6
Hilarious to see tewatia and the other youngsters getting hate while the star studded top order chilling without taking any responsibility,60
Tewatia sensed that RR doesn't deserve him,17
"DC is getting through this tournament with their bowling. Thus two south Africans are crazy good.

Add in Ashwin and also axar and this tushar guy and man it's tough.

DC batting still has a hole or two.",31
"DC‚Äôs still my second favourite (about to be first looking at RR today), go on guys. win this tournament",5
Delhi bowling is 10x better than Delhi batting.,17
Where can i get the RR jersey. Looks good,2
[My sentiments right now](https://geekireland.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Superman-False-God.jpg),10
"The position on points table is there for a reason for both teams. One knows how to win, one knows how to lose",6
"Ben did well opening today, but now may be RR will play him in his correct position. They needed him there at the end today.",11
Shout out to Ashwin for 4 over 17-1 his 16th over started this.,15
"As a KXIP fan, I am not even disappointed. I have seen much worse.",25
"**DC bowlers**

16th over - 2 runs

17th over - 8 runs

18th over - 4 runs

19th over - 3 runs

20th over - 8 runs.

Only 25 runs in 5 overs. Brilliant death bowling",23
We hyped Uthapa .. you are welcome other teams,6
"Clearly seperates mi and rr as teams, both chasing 160s against dehli",25
Not the first time such collapses has happened in this tournament,6
congratulations to RR for snatching a defeat from the ~~jaws~~ tits of victory.,21
rahane to be kept as specialist fielder.,27
"To the person who said that DC doesn't have great death bowling well, what now?",14
I kinda like dhawan as captain.. seems very nurturing as well,14
Tewatia is the false prophet,7
[deleted],-6
I can't believe we actually won,13
"80-20 rule. Every choke this IPL has been 80% shit batting, 20% good bowling.",13
"smith says the same damn things after every match (bat deeper blah blah), and then rr comes back and repeats the same mistakes.",25
The only thing that matters is that Tewatia remains unbeaten.,13
"Fuck the Lord,did nothing against quality bowling,he is just very lucky,no wonder he is not in the Indian team!!",1
Robin is responsible for that run out. He should be belted on his butts by parag,9
Tewatia false prophet confirmed,15
"People shitting on Robin, while ignoring, out of form Smith.",40
If the tournament had been shifted to SA instead of UAE ......DC would be on another level....Batsman who likes pace....the African duo...,18
It‚Äôs gonna hurt if DC doesn‚Äôt win this year,17
Absolutely brilliant death bowling. Also how Robin Uthappa hasn't been arrested for fraud is beyond me.,11
Tewatia is just a roughie who cunts local bowlers..against fine pace bowling he will come back with some lube and a towel and gets ass fucked.,-8
Ash üòç,6
Ashwin for team India ‚úä,16
Rajasthan have thrown this away,6
Lord got neutralized like a little bish,13
Is it me or anyone else think Tushar has similar action to Thakur,5
What was Tewatia‚Äôs strategy for playing four dot balls against R Ashwin?,12
Dc reminds me of 2016 srh who had a better bowling side than batting,13
So my friend called me and we were in the 15th over. And I just came back hopelessly and saw that we won by 13 fucking runs. Wtf happened!!?,9
How did we manage to defend 160 now when we couldn't in the last game?,10
Ashwin MOTM pls,16
DC conceded 26 in the last 5 overs and RR conceded 32. Great bowling by Rabada/Nortje/Ashwin and Archer/Tyagi.,18
"Domestic Indian batsmen can't adjust to express pace of Rabada, Nortje etc. Tewatia completely out of sorts against pace. We need to invest more than we are doing in pace in the domestic cricket.",15
Come on RR seriously can't hope Tewatia to revive them every time the batting order collapses.,26
Teams preparing against DC look for playing rabada and Ashwin and nokia ... But the forget their big weapon Axar and give wickets to him trying to go after him.,14
Tewatia needs 30 balls to come good. He only got through the first phase of his innings today.,10
"Whatever RR did, we did better. They bowled fast, we bowled faster. They bowled well in death, we bowled better.",27
Don't blame utthapa blame smith.,13
Why doesn't RR just switch Robbie and Stokes' positions?,13
NO offense but Rabada talks like he is mimicking some-one hahaha,8
"Mind you, lord was not out till end. to da lu mother fuckers stopped the match after 20 overa.",2
"Serious question if Iyer is okay to move around, would you still think Dhawan should be the one giving the winning Captain's interview ?",12
who was the captain while iyer had a date with pant?,11
Last match was winnable but Iyer left the strike bowlers for too late. Captaincy was on point today!,6
Don‚Äôt blame anyone. They were just outclassed by a great death bowling performance . Got to give credit to the opposition for just being better .,17
Petition to move Rob Robbie to replace tuk tuk Raina who for a fact has done no shit in past 2 seasons,3

"Captains refusing to take a greater share of the responsibility is a recurring theme. Own up personally at least once, goddamnit! Smith has been in atrocious form, and what the hell is Rajasthan thinking - opening with Stokes! Might as well give Buttler the new ball. Uthappa has done well at the top in the past - put him in with Buttler: one accumulator, one basher, it's not rocket science!

Zeez. So many shitting on Tewatia when he won 2/3 games. He's a bowling allrounder. Also whoever made the batting order royallyshat the bed. You make Robbie the opener and Stokes the finisher. Not the other way around.,36

We are gonna witness epic playoffs,8
I am back to being an atheist,11
"No one :

Anrich Nortje today : I'm fast as fuck boiiiii",29
Dont make Pant lose his form my benching him for long.,-9
I am going to watch the highlights now. Star Sports is really quick.,4
"To be honest, I am still not ever DC losing to MI but this helps a little.",16
"I've spoken a lot of shit about Rahane, but boi he justified his place with that fielding effort alone.",21
Games like this i wonder if what happened if bowlers are allowed to bowl more than 4 overs like batsman are allowed to go on batting for 20 overs if they can.,15
I am really having a hard time hearing some of these folks from the top of the table.,31
"Stokes is not an opener, he is a finisher

Robbie is not a finisher, he is an opener

Whose decision was it to fuck around with the batting order ?

First Smith decided he should open and now this.",21
"Smith should drop himself, 

bring in Killer Miller",12
"From Twitter 

>Just because Steve Smith is an overseas player & an Australian cricketer he is not been criticized for his poor form & awful captaincy.... But the treatment is completely opposite with Indian players like Dinesh Kartik, KL Rahul if they or their team fail to perform...",30
"Some post match thoughts regarding DD:

* Dhawan batted really well today, dunno why he chose to play slow against Mumbai considering both innings came at a time when DD were in similar positions(had lost 2 wickets early) & also good captaincy at the end
* Our fielding is still poor, at some point this is gonna cost us not only extra runs, but possibly a match
* DC were still 15-20 runs short today too, like they were against MI. Scoring only 32 in last 5 could have costed them the game. Granted DC is playing without Pant & Hetmyer but really need to improve lower middle order
* All bowlers did really well today, especially Nortje & Ashwin. Axar too considering he went for 23 in his first 2, but came back strongly giving only 9 runs in his last 2 while also running out Parag(Thanks Uthappa).
* Rahane needs to be given another chance & shaw needs to sit down if Pant is unfit.
* DC's domestic bench is literally shit, if iyer & Pant are both unfit there's literally one option in the batting department for them & that's Lalit Yadav who's a batting allrounder who hasn't played a single IPL match",26
I wonder how many instances would there be of taking a wicket off the first ball but still lose the match,8
[Here's ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/jazg1j/match_thread_30th_match_delhi_capitals_v/g8svn6x/) the guy who predicted Buttler's 22(9),15
wrong thread.,1
Feel bad for Jofra man,8
