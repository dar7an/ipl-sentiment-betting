"I am not sure if I have given up. But it seems like we used up all the good stuff out of the team in the last 2 years. The loss of Raina and Bhajji is just too much to handle for the team.

So the next 7 matches, I will try to enjoy it like I did in 2018. Like we had 2 years of nothing. Any win is a bonus from now. Hope they play for pride with the pride.",17
Can we please just bat first today for a change ?,56
Must win match today,7
"I think we should actually try to chase in this game. Yes, CSK haven‚Äôt set a total in 7 games and I hope they get a chance now. Neither SRH nor CSK has good death bowlers, and our lack of death bowling was exposed in the previous game.  
 
If SRH bats first, then we‚Äôre simply one Faf/Watson/Rayudu special away from losing. I think our batsmen can take on Bravo and Shardul bowling at the death. But I don‚Äôt think our bowlers can defend 30 off the last 2 if Faf and Jadeja are batting.",3
[deleted],55
This has the potential to be a bore fest. Hoping that I‚Äôm wrong,23
"Our bowlers are improving though. That's been one positive. Only we we managed to stem the bleeding in last few overs. 

I almost want to give them a pass because even the exhausted Kohli was just too good in the end.",30
The most boring match of the Year,15
"Alright guys! based on the first half of the league stage, pick your 11. Max 2 from one franchise, max 4 overseas.

Rahul, Mayank, Sky, Iyer, AB, Curran, Tewatia, Rashid, Rabada,  Bumrah, Chahal",12
Kane Williamson can play at better strike rate than every other player playing today.,4
Williamson needs to bat with more overs to spare. Having the one of the best batsmen coming out to bat with just 3 overs left is like having a Ferrari to only go to the grocery store. Williamson at 3. Pandey at 4.,8
"I honestly don't know what we can do to improve. Tahir in for Bravo? Now that the tracks are slowing down, we just hope that we can strangle the opposition and try to chase the score. As MS said we need to reverse everything that CSK stood for - taking it deep and then going berserk. Go hard in the beginning and hope you don't lose too many wickets. Clearly, if we lose too many, we are screwed anyway. If we lose today, might as well groom the bench for the next IPL from now on. Gaikwad, Santner, Sai Kishore for Watto, Jaddu and Karn. Let Santner open with Faf. If it works, we could have a good opening pair in Santner and Watto next season with Faf three and Ambati four. Or Raina will come back...",9
"I don't think I care anymore, I am just going to enjoy watching Dhonis few of last outings on field, win or lose.",9
The is probably gonna be the most boring game of the season,9
The only way to fix SRH is to ensure Vijay Shankar starts to deliver. Both with the bowl and bat.,6
"K P, Sunny and Neroli Meadows",4
I‚Äôll just be glad if we don‚Äôt sustain another injury.,17
 Am here just to see Thala maintain his 50+ average this season.,4
"If you look at how well the spinners are performing in this IPL (Chahal, Washington, Rashid, Axar) someone of Tahir's caliber can really help CSK. They are understandably preferring Bravo because of his batting but I think they should to play Tahir in some matches.",16
Y'all see any mid season trades happening? I don't see any for MI specifically. I think KXIP would try for a quality pacer like Steyn or Ferguson.,1
Ffs hope dhoni gets the toss luck correct,1
"I thinking the age finally caught up with csk. Since most of them are retired, they haven't played much high caliber cricket recently. Probably explains why the only ones who are performing are Curran and Faf",3

Unrelated but did Dhoni had a hair transplant? His hair looks weird now,8
Is it too much to wish for CSK to bat in such a manner that doesn‚Äôt make me want to pull my hair out?,8

"10 years ago they were 10 years younger and majority were in their prime, comparing this to 2010 is absolutely baseless",9

"Commentators talking about CSK doing a 2010 repeat, as they were at the same points in 2010 as they are now in 2020. MI were also first then, KXIP were also last then. I don't think, it is possible, not just because of the quality of CSK, but simply because of the playoff system, much harder to win the league with 3rd or 4th place. I really hope it doesn't happen again, still remember 38 year old SRT playing out of his skin and not being able to win:/",-1

When does the transfer window open? I heard they were waiting for all teams to complete 7 games.,7
"Given their history, I'm surprised that RCB hasn't bought Khaleel yet.",5
"I think the big gap (even before Covid) from Cricket has ultimately affected Dhoni. He looks exhausted on the field. 

Would be interesting to see if he plays next IPL. Right now it's not about his form but more about his fitness and being in touch with Cricket throughout the year. 

Other retired international players play in the various T20 leagues around the world so they are always practicing and playing. Dhoni is already retired and his inability to play in any other T20 league because of BCCI restrictions would again keep him from any action for quite some time. The only respite he can get that the next IPL is just few months away (Mar 2021) so won't be much of a big gap. 

Hope he finds his groove in the second half of this season. It's just kills me to see him this way.",4
Hope our lord and savior Manish Pandey make a hundred with a glorious strike rate of 120,6
Who was the table topper in this week's dugout ?,3
At last god damn,10
Yaay for a a test match day again where only one team may play t20 style!,-6
My playoff goal is also coming to an end for SRH now. Unfortunately we just aren‚Äôt the same with an experienced pace bowler like Bhuvi or even Marsh.,3
CSK batting first finally,4
Dhoni is a fucking madlad can't hate this dudeüòÇ,15
Csk batting first. Hopefully some good fortune. They can still make it into the playoffs.,7

Lmao they dropped Jagadeesan,1
"Tamil vs telugu today

Southern derby",0
So csk going in one batsman short?,4
CSK won't be chasing this time. Will this result in change of fortune for them? Let's see.,2
"Yea good choice this, dropping Jagdeesan.

Not like we have a shitty batting or anything",12
"Csk batting looks wafer thin, tonight. 2 wickets early for srh and it could be tough for csk to come back. Need a strong top order performance tonight",2
Jagdeesan didn't do that bad honestly in the last match.,1
"Does anyone remember when Robin Jackman kept saying that whichever team wins overs 11-15, they‚Äôre likely to win the game?",1
6d chess by dhoni.. drop batsmen from squad and then lose by 70 odd runs and say one less batsmen cost us the game..,2
"At last it's time, time to start the intent orgy.",1
One batsman short when the batting isnt clicking? Bold strategy cotton.,4
"So basically we are playing 6 batsmen? Well, truly RIP our chances now.",7
So they dropped their only good batsman,1
What's with CSK not giving enough chances to youngsters? First Gaikwad and now Jagadeeshan,3
Jagadeeshan played with intent and betrayed Dhoni last time. Hence the axe /s,11
Hopefully Curran gets promoted tonight,8
"They were doing tuk tuk wit that long ass batting lineup, can't imagine what they'll do with a batsman short today",3
"Even if we collapse, atleast the other team will chase it down comfortably. Won't have to deal with a shitty chase, clinging onto hope and then suffer inevitable heartbreak.",13
Csk finally gonna bat first. I'm sure this will change things around. They'll lose by wickets instead of runs now.,0
"Harsh call this, for Jagadeesan, he played a promising innings the other night. 

Perhaps too youthful though, maybe that's a problem.",7
Surely Tahir has to play ahead of Watson or Bravo,4
"SRH have left out their only pinch hitter, RIP this match. I'm outta here Bois",5

God plz forgive me but i wud have dropped lord shankar

Abishek sharma has given few good performances",3
SRH are one batsman short too.....maybe we can finally see Rashid the FINISHER!!,7
glad they're batting first,2
Not surprising that csk brought extra spinner.I reckon Every team will have to accommodate 2 spinners in their lineup considering how slow the pitches are going to be. Expect low scores from now on,1
Hoping CSK to score at least 160+. I think 175-180 will be above par.,1
Do they think it'll be slow/turn today? What's with the extra spinner on both sides?,1
With one batsman out Pandey may play more conservatively. 55(52) incoming.,8
Bravo definitely has Dhoni's nudes,9
Both teams have gone for a spinner. Interesting.,4
I really hate when CSK don't play youngester like Sai Kishore they should have gone with him In place of chawala,7
"I wish youngsters like Ruturaj or Jagadeesan were in some other team. At least they'll get chances. 

We are fucking second last in the table and still not ready to try something new.",38
"Guys whatever you do, do not start CSK's redemption arc where those fuckers will suddenly get back to winning and will go on to win the trophy. Serious chills whenever we play CSK",13
"Absolutely no issues with SRH dropping Abhishek. Shrewd move. Rashid has hardly batted this season and he's more than decent to be a No.7. Fifth bowler has been their problem, so it's pretty cool to have Shahbaz Nadeem fix it. Shankar and Kane can chip in if needed.",13
"Csk have competent bats down to 7 and Chawla's not useless with the bat, lineup seems fine to me, need the extra spinner.",7
CSK batting 1st with only 4 specialist batsmen.,3
"CSK homies, do you feel Bravo to be a batsmen?",4
Dhoni vs Rashid key battle,1
"SRH: WTF why would they drop Abhishek who was our only genuine hitter after openers. Nadeem should have replaced Sandeep Sharma(why he is even persisted with)

CSK: Also WTF Poor Jagadeesan, made him wait for 3 long years and finally when he gets his chance hits a decent score only to be dropped in next match that too for Piyush Chawla.

Give me a break man. These two teams competed for best team for worst team changes today.",10
"I feel a bit sorry for Nabi at the moment. He is in excellent form with bat and ball, but because of the weakness of SRH‚Äôs batting he just can‚Äôt get a game.

If a fifth international player was allowed he would come in immediately for Nadeem and strengthen SRH‚Äôs middle-order considerably.",7
"Two teams with peak collapse tendency, one with a slow one and one like real quick",9
I am ready to get hurt again,10
Surely Kane has to move to 3 he isn't facing enough balls at the moment,12
Aren't chawla and karn exactly the same type of bowler. I swear their bowling action is same too. And chawla's fielding makes me cry,7
"Q: What is more boring than a CSK match?

A: Match in which CSK bats first.",13
*chuckles nervously*,2
"Man, with CSK‚Äôs spin lineup, I don‚Äôt know how our guys are going to go after spinners.",4
Why are they promoting Dhoni Vs Rashid as a battle lmao...,14
"Thala needs to refrain himself from those test cricket shots against spinners ,try to nudge it for singles",5
"Interesting, CSK opted for 3 spinners",6
Kane mama and Manish need to take on the spinners.,4
Spin bowling is going to be crucial moving forwards. Absolutely loved the spin choke yesterday,3

I feel like csk are gonna come at this game with vengeance,2
this csk lineup is the epitome of batdeep,3
"Faf, Rayuddu or Curran? Whom to select for the fantasy league?",1
CSK sucks in encouraging young talent.,8
Bit offtopic but which Reddit app do you guys think is best for following match threads? The official app is arse and the mobile site gets less appealing by the day.,2
It‚Äôs raining a lot in Hyderabad. Don‚Äôt feel good for the Sunrisers.,4
CSK won 4/8 tosses. No excuses now hahaha,-1
Thank god ipl is happening in uae.It has been raining since morning in Hyderabad,2
"Manish, you can score upto 49 runs but no 50 pls!",5
Sam Curran or Watson for Fantasy league ?,1
It genuinely hurts guys.,1
obligatory reminder that piyush chawla is younger than priyam garg,6
Abhishek didn‚Äôt really do anything wrong to be dropped by I don‚Äôt mind the extra spinner,1
CSK winning it comfortably,0
Both these teams are not the best at chasing so csk batting first sucks for srh,3
"It's frustrating to support SRH.. Neither you are the best - you can brag about... Nor you are the worst - you can rant freely...

Every time you give up hope, they get improbable win and every time you think they are on the roll, they lose an easier encounter...",11
This is exactly why no young batsmen have been able to breakout from CSK ranks in a decade. They never give such guys even a handful of matches. Hope Jagadeeshan gets to play for a better franchise.,4
"Looks like Dhoni found Jagadesan's true birth certificate.

Thala: But but I know I saw the hair dyes and a set of dentures in your bag. Tell me you aren't 24.

Jagadeesan: Sorry Thala, those were gifts for teammates.

Thala: Get out of my sight. You make me sick.",23
I feel this is going to be a low scoring match given how the pitches are slowing down and csk batsman mostly love pace on the bowl and choke against spin. Srh with 2 spinners won't help the cause either. I am already ready to hear *tuk tuk* comments.,2
CSK has batsman till no. 9 still looks so hollow,4
"CSK batting first for the first time since the 1st qualifier against MI in May 2019 - ten matches ago.

It is the joint-longest such sequence in IPL. KKR chased in nine consecutive matches in 2014.

How to protect NRR while defending? Asking for an enemy,3
How to motivate myself to watch this? Help,4
"I stumbled into Watson's Youtube channel and saw some comments that really was sad to see. Hope CSK don't disappoint today, for those people's sake.",7
Finally we have 5 specialist bowlers. Rashid is good for a No.7 batsman in T20 as someone said in previous SRH thread.,5
Dropping a middle order batsman when the middle order is not solid ffs.,16
[deleted],5
Obligatory *I never thought Piyush is as old as Koach*,6
"Sorry CSK fans, your getting no love from this SRH fan, you guys have caused me enough heartbreaks",5
Whining is unbearable here and match hasn't started yet.,4
No Swann yesssss,1
Border gavaskar trophy test 2,10
"Obligatory, they use Piyush chawla as weighing scale to measure 1 quintal wheat...",7
Why drop Jagdessen? He played only 1,5
So CSK dropped the only batsman that performed decently I'm the last match. WHY,10
Didn't realize that R Gayakwad was the second highest scorer in SMA trophy 2019. He should have been groomed by CSK. It is not certain that he'll click but it is better to groom younger players imo,3
MI is getting incredible value out of Krunal. His bowling stats are miles ahead of Jadeja‚Äôs in this IPL and are basically the same as a specialist spinner.,3
Dropping jagdeeshan who played reasonably well last match seems odd,14
"I feel warner is the key today for srh

If he survives the pp

Then warner against 2 leggies n 1 left arm spinner with ball coming in for him is gonna be juicy

If he gets out then there r no left handers in that batting line up",5
there was one only guy who was showing intent and CSK removed him and brought in Lord Chawla.,3

Sunil Tonk-The-Ball Gavaskar,4
Why isn't CSK playing Tahir??,6
"Honestly who all are part of the team to deciding playing 11 for a match in SRH.

I somehow feel Laxman somehow has a soft corner for players like Manish and Garg and might be backing them during those discussions ( if he has a say). Unfortunately players like Abhishek might be losing out due to that.",4

Sam Curran opening. YAASSS,6
Curran opening?,3
Ok Curran to open lmao,6
Sam Curran to open. Interesting.,5
Curran opening,3
Dropping Faf to number 3 would make more sense....right?,6
People just want csk to lose today and punjab to win the next match to satisfy their dying wish to see csk at bottom of table,6
S-Sam?,3
Sam Curran will be the new Sunil Narine. The Narine who failed for 3 seasons. Bad decision IMHO,2
Watson looks extra handsome today,5
What's up with teams experimenting their batting line up against SRH?,7
Curran opening the batting due to a slow first 10 overs is utterly baffling. I don't think this is the answer chief,-3
"FIRST TIME WE ARE BATTING FIRST IN IPL 2020, AND IM SEEING FAF WITH **SAM FOOKIN CURRAN!** LEGGO",9
Sam Curran is opening the batting. CSK have been reading my emails.,17

"Back in 2015- 18 phase, I used to think youngsters like Pant and Iyer deserve a better team and are stuck with a shit team.

Looking at Jagdeeshan who has been with CSK for past 3 years, I have changed my opinion now. Atleast Pant and Iyer got to play all 14 matches right from their debut season because everyone else was just shit.",10

Curran opening makes much more sense to me then Narine opening ever did,6
"Sandeep sharma should bowl three in power play and 1 in middle.

He shouldn‚Äôt be bowling death",6
"Great idea opening with Curran, if he gets a 30 off 10 Brilliant, if he gets out who really cares.",17
If you're not opening with Watto. What's the point of having him,4
"You guys are too harsh on this csk changes to their team.

Csk have shown that any chase above 170 isn't possible for them. So, moving forward I think they will go bowling heavy to restrict their opponents.

If they can't chase a massive total than the right thing to do is to make the total achievable. Interesting strategy but they need to stop runs from leaking at death overs",8
curry chan üòÉ,2
Curran opening feels like it could make this csk side dangerous,7
This match will be either interesting as hell or bored to our deaths. There's no in-between,5
Sandeep's last over against RR which was also the 17th over gave 18 runs and turned momentum in favor of RR. He shouldn't be anywhere near death bowling.,2

Even though Sandeep has a decent economy rate the problem is batsmen look 100% in control against him. He rarely beats batsmen or forces them to play a false shot. Not going to threaten much with that pace.,2
Came onto Reddit just to comment that CSK should try Curran as a Narine-type experiment. Dhoni one step ahead I see.,12
Fam wtf did jagadeesan do to get replaced by piyush lmaoooo fuck this team,4
But why not Curran and Watto?,-3

Lol hoped Sam would be one or two down .... But trying to open with him is still a gamble worth taking.,3
Well fielded,1
Cricketers were allowed to bring a hair stylist weren't they??,3
It would be hilarious if a team had identical twins playing with one a very good batsman and the other a good bowler. They could masquerade as each other so that the batsman could bat twice and bowler bowl twice. However this would mean both developing 2 distinct styles of batting or bowling.,8
Not opening Watson is the reason why he failed in RCB,3
Faf just wants the strike man tf you doing?,1
Shahbaz Nadeem has a bowling average of 10 in test cricket,1
lmao Faf hasn‚Äôt faced even one ball yet. I hope Curran gets another single here,1
Sam Curran channeling his inner Vijay,4
Are all currans shit?,2
"Khaleel masterstroke, distracting batsman with that shit shave",7
Watto was horrible in RCB when was given middle order responsibilities. His fortune changed when he came to CSK where he opened. Now he's back to square one.,6
Why not faf at 3? Don't want Watto to face the swinging ball?,8
Both CSK and SRH went into this match with the mentality 'you can't have middle order collapses if you don't have a middle order',90
Curran and bravo are 2 similar players gotta get tahir for one of them.,9
Ngl. expected Curran to be on 20-30 by now.,7
"tamil commentary: both teams office is in MRC nagar. if you hit six from one office, will land in the other",18
Sam Curran has figured out the secret to surviving in a team of geriatrics.,6
Yeah curran's gonna go out trying to cunt the ball isn't he?,6
Someone's played a very cruel joke by telling Khaleel he's looking good with that shave,62
F,3
lmfao CSK please,4
Watson is genuinely pissed off,6
That's why you give strike bitch,5
Who won last week's Dugout competition?,3
Noooooo Faf :((((,4
Wow this is going well huh,2
Lmao,1
Whatfix girl got that fake ass accent,5
"Golden duck for Faf

That's well bowled",7
Faf fulfilled our wish of wanting Watson to open,21
Why would u give him the strike curran??,7
Sam tried his level best to protect Faf but alas !,6
GG,3
Good boy Sandeep.,5
"Told ya , go sandeep",2
Let‚Äôs goooo baby,3
Hot Take- Dhoni should come at 3 and Watto should Play as the Finisher,6
"Ahaha Watson is fucking fuming that Sam's opening ahead of him, I love it",6
Bad idea to open with Curran and Faf,1
Wow that was some swing,7
Lmao fuck this game,1
Bruh.,2
hot take: Sandeep is as good with the new ball as Bhuvi is. It‚Äôs just Bhuvi is 1000x better in the death,10
What was that half hearted defense,2
And it's started LUL,6
And there goes my captain in D11,6
What the Faf?,3
"Well done,now need to take Sam",2
wicket du? plessis.,4
Faf was the only reliable guy,5
There is the fuck up starting,2
Less than 100 score incoming,4
Sandeep redemption match?,3
"There goes my Captain, there goes any chance of climbing the rankings.",4
All this time curran was trynna protect faf,16
What the fuck thats my dream11 captain,48
What a soft dismissal for Faf.,7
Silly experiment to try opening with Faf imo,19
"People were crying here why Faf isn't getting the strike.

Well this is why",8
"While Sandeep can‚Äôt bowl at the death, you do have to acknowledge he is terrific in the first 3 when in form.

IMO, SRH should just give him 3 overs in the first 6.",10
"I feel that this is currans last chance to prove himself. If he fails then he goes out for tahir and a  batsman steps in for either karn or chawla, whoever does better gets to stay",3
Feel bad for faf,3
"**2.1** Sandeep Sharma to du Plessis, OUT, **got him!** Faf waits ten minutes to have the strike and goes first ball. **10-1**

F du Plessis c &dagger;Bairstow b Sandeep Sharma 0 (1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00",2
Hopefully Watto will come and go crazy since he seems kinda angry already,3
"How will Watson play in the middle overs?
Faf : Hold my bat",3
We'll have a bat first thanks!!,4
Faf noooooooooo,5
Angry Watson incoming,7
"Why‚Äôd csk remove Jagdeesan, their only in form batsman from last game",4
Fap -- 0 (1),8
"3D tactics from Curran protecting Faf from the strike, he did his best.",6
*2018 Final Watson PTSD*,11
"Imagine Currn getting out after playing 20 balls with a sr of under 100, for watto to come in after pp just to get out on the first ball.... It'll be classic csk 2020",4
Wtf was Watson doing with the camera,1
Look how small Watto makes that bat look,1
I hope Faf du eats Fafda and posts a pic sometime,1
By the time Curran gets out of IPL 2020 he's going to get Thalafied,7
Plug one hole and the 2nd one appears,8
How the fuck has Sandeep never played for India. At least give him some chances In England tours...,-2
yeah fuck this shit,5
Problem with promoting lower order batsmen is they often play with opening mindset and look to defend balls instead of hitting from the start,7
Keep Calm and Trust Thala üòéüòé,3
Lol. If Faf doesn‚Äôt perform in the remaining matches then CSK will break the IPL record of the worst NRR.,7
Faf felt bad for Watson,3
 they didn't send Watson cause MS knew the openers will be out early. 5D chess by Thala,10
Watson's facing the swinging ball now. None of csk's plans have worked since the first match where they sent Currant ahead of Dhoni,5
Watson please channel all your anger into batting,1
"Faf was over performing as an opener, made no sense to keep trying that when he's guaranteed to do better at first drop",2
Ok so Shane was the real opener,6
"Get 4 overs of Sandeep done finished right away, he's shit at death",9
"""its happening all over again"".

 \# CSK hangover",3
"After quitting Fantasy cricket, I feel much better watching games. Don‚Äôt have to stress out on it.",13
That one was my fault. I got up,4
Aaaaaand a golden duck for their only batsman,7
"Faf is playing bad since  that kxip match, sad, only he seemed to be in form....",4
lmao and i thought things gonna get better!,3
Who's choking tonight?,1
Sandeep Sharma: A talented bowler and ballet dancer rolled into 1 package while being a budget Jason Momoa.,2
"That swing is exactly why sandy should bowl 3 in the power play and one in middle

Not two in power play and two in death",5
I hope Warner finishes off sandy in power play or middle overs and don't keep him for death. FFS his over gave the momentum to RR and we choked it,1
Why did Watson seem pissed at the camera?,1
Extreme pressure on the middle order now.,1
"Lol everyone one wanting watto to open , well he's only a ball late .... Considering sam faced the first 12",1
Faf duck Plessis,7
"We already have no batting order to chase 160, now the mastermind Dhoni/Fleming has deceided to replace a batsman with a bowler.

Now we have lost Faf. Nice.",5
What crap was this lineup? Why did they drop the only newcomer that was promising for fucking Chawla,8
"**Hates me to say this but openers put a lot of pressure on Faf Du Plessis.
He performed so well when he played at 3 then opening ruined it**",8
Chennai is super kill,2
Curran bby what you doing,0
CSK is staring at another snooze fest if Watson fails today also,8
Fafs first duck since 2014 damnn,10
Thala Curran,5
**FAFS FIRST DUCK IN THE IPL SINCE 2014!!**,7
Maybe the point was to piss off Watson and make him go brrrr...,5
Well there goes any chance of stealing more quick runs.... Hopefully Watton brought his six hitting ability with him today.,2
"Watto taking a single and giving strike back to Curran. So, the CSK plan is that Curran will play sheet anchor and others will play around him. Smart.

Nobody would guess this. /s",8
Noooooo not Faf. He wasn‚Äôt the imposter.,3
"Dang, Curran's played 10 dots in 14 balls :/",4
Has Dhoni fucking lost his mind to pick Chawla over Jagadeesan and not picking Thaheer,7
"RPS 2016 it is!!

We will win final match to end 7th.",7
What is the point of promoting Curran if he's just going to play defensively,7
First duck since 2014 in IPL,3
Sunny G talking about stroking things marvelously lol,4
Jagadeesan out because of too much intent,14
"Gaikwad was the 2nd highest run scorer in Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy (419 runs @ 41.9), CSK should open with him and move Faf down to 3",5
Lol. What shite team this is. Hope the dismantle the whole squad next season and start anew,4
Today is the first second leg of matches right.,6
Curran's playing way too cautiously for a slogger. What did they tell him,5
MS Curran.,4
"Predict CSK's score

146-153",3
"I want to see Dhoni open in one match, just for the memes",7
"Lmao, Sam Curran got the CSK slow batting disease by moving up",5
"Dang, so they actually tried something else. May not work out but still good to see",6
"Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll ever sink in for me how mad the IPL is in bringing together all these international cricketers. 

Watson, who is involved in one of my earliest cricketing memories (2011 ashes) is batting with Sam Curran, who is 2 years older than me and once played my brother in an age group match.",9
Can't help but feel Curran opening tbe batting isnt a sign of great squad building,5
Stephen Fleming looking dead inside!,4
KP might be confusing desperation for intent there.,9
"I like Suresh Raina. Good guy giving support to people in need. No matter what happened b/w him and the management, he will be wishing them the best.",5
Curran learning to take it deep‚Ñ¢.,7
Shit squad selection. CSK fucking doomed till auction or until we make someone else captain.,5
Someone explain me the UpGrad ad?,1
What are these people tryna do ü§¶,2
"Who has Chennai not played yet, this is second match between SRH and CSK",2
Fleming in depression,2
"Was thinking about Lagaan again today and made me realise what an epic buy Kachra would have been for the IPL, just like Rashid Khan. Got me thinking about other equivalents - 

Bhuvan - Overtly emotional hero captain - Virat Kohli

Lakha - Redemption story king - Tewatia

Bagha - Shit fielder, can hit though - Prithvi Shaw 

Ismail - Solid, gritty batsman - Warner

Ishwar - Wanted to do it for the team, but too old - Ahem... Captain Super King

Guran - Overtly talkative, wild slogger - Pant 

Bhura - Specialist fielder - Gurkeerat Mann :( 

Kachra - Insane wrist spinner - Rashid Khan

Tipu - Promising young kid - Padikkal

Deva - Legit allrounder, experienced AF - Pollard

Arjan - ?

Goli - ?",7
Intent by commentators.,2
I have to say it‚Äôs rather satisfying to see CSK struggle this year after having to watch them win so often,9
This will be the most boring match in entire ipl.,5
Out.,2
Fleming looks pissed off,2
Don‚Äôt waste reviews homie. Not like last game out of desperation.,3
Lol only the 3rd over in a 40 over game and people are already predicting doom for CSK,12
Did Nadeem put on weight? He looked like a stick when he debuted in that test match last year,5
Let's start the intent counter : 1,10
"Wot, looks good to me...",1
"How's it going so far? And if csk lose this, they're out?",1
Too close for comfort there Watto,2
I rather watch Apple event tonight than this borefest,0
Warner looking like Littlefinger from GoT with that moustache.,3
Sam Curran already got a wicket without bowling.,3
You know how Manchester United have been dog shit under Ole?  CSK is like that now. Kinda fun to watch won't lie.,3
"Pitch is clearly hard to bat on. Despite the poor start, CSK came prepared with the intention to defend any total.",4
Loving the 70's male pornstar look from Warner,16
Mutual funds sahi hai,2
"""Intent"" has replaced ""corona"" as the no.1 buzzword of 2020*

*Special thanks to Kevin Petersen",8
Exactly what MSD said. Close one hole and 2 more appears.,19
"Umesh Yadav seems predictable in t20 and despite being a short of length bowler he is fairly successful in tests because I have seen at least 1 of 20 balls he delivers does something crazy and gives him a wicket.

Also he is a workhorse with pace. Too bad it is difficult to change bowling styles one learns early in career and I think changing it does more harm than good.",3
Commentators busting out the INTENT‚Ñ¢ early today,7
"Curran is in that weird space where he's a good enough batsman to care about his wicket and his reputation, but he's not really good enough that he can afford to think that way. Narine works because he doesn't care about batting, he's ok with swinging at everything and risking a duck. Curran is better than that, he cares, but right now he doesn't have the ability to be useful when he isn't slogging.",16
"Sam looks so confused right now. Its like the management told him to play his natural game and at the same time, told him to not be aggressive.",2
Sending Curran to open was probably a move they made just for the hell of it. They're just winging it.,4
Great shot for 4,2
Sam curran at the top is the way to the top,3
why isnt watto bowling,2
"No one:

Sanjay: ""Sam Karan""",10
Calm down peeps. It's the 3rd over.,8
Khaleel's yelping is a signal for the batsman to attack him lmao,5
"Had a fantasy IPL group with my friends with pooled prize money in 2018. Was getting too stressed so decided to completely blackout from watching an MI game and just checked score next day

That game MI failed to chase 110 something against SRH and got bowled out for 87. After that I quit playing fantasy IPL forever",3
"Ena dhan KUTTY CURRANam adichalum, batting ivalodhan pola. 


T: Attempted pun.",4
"Look at that ball lmao, he literally spoon fed that to big sam to hit that for boundary",4
Curran is back babbbyyyy!,5
Another Tewatia ?,3
Ok now the shithousery starts,3
khaleels beard separating hyderabad and telangana.,10
Kid's not timing at all,2
Curran playing run a ball is already 100 times better than our previous openings.,4
"We get it Sunny,you watch tennis.",6
"""Like a Rafa Nadal forehand, double handed"" 

I don't think Sunny G watches tennis",8
Looks like Sunny G read french open news,3
SunnyG continues to make the odd comment straight out of his ass,6
Just a different satisfaction seeing Khaleel get smashed,8
Curran at his avg score of 17,3
the only boy with intent^(TM),6
"See, atleast Sam makes his slow start count",4
Finally,1
Sam Curran is the GOAT idc,6
Might be speaking too soon but this is why you need some young blood in the team as well,5
Only a matter of time before Jadeja and Curran open together.,11
r/cricket not knowing what they‚Äôre talking about again. Obviously Khaleel‚Äôs CSK‚Äôs 7th batsman,7
Sammy's getting going,1

Sam Curran's promotion is already paying off. Maybe he was meant to be an opener.,3
NOW IT'S WORKING,3

Ohh Daddy Curran!! Oh yeahhh,7
Wow! A CSK batsman with 100+ SR? Didn‚Äôt Sam get the memo?,20

omg i'm CRYING,7
"What the fuck, Khaleel. Fucking braindead",7
Sam Curran doing the job up the order for CSK after the rest of the Batting Order has failed most of the times,5
[deleted],-3
Let me just bowl 3 balls in the exact same spot... that will work,6
"One of the (many) things that annoys me about IPL is the constant insistence from comms that the team ""is looking to take it deep into the game"", especially when taking about Dhoni. Just smash the fucking ball and win with 2 overs to spare rather than dragging it out until you've got no hope (again, mostly on the case of Dhoni). Effectively saying ""this team is looking to make it as difficult for themselves as they can"".",4
"Lol, surprised it went that far.",3
That is some intent,3

"Well , Curran has done his job",6
Wtf was that from Curran,3
"YOU BEAUTY, YOU ABSOLUTE BEAUTY",5
Night and day difference between the two bowlers.,5
"Sorry for the inconvenience, the test match will now resume",59
Just shows ball is swinging. Khaleel kept bowling the same short ball without using his brains,6
Sandeep feels like a completely different breed from the 2018 finals.,8
"Curran my boy, Your fight is over.",7
Yeah fuck this,5
Not bad though.....Curran got them off to a better start than expected,5
Regardless of what happens from here. This is 10000 times better than tuktuk,41
Did his job. Nice 31 at good pace.,9
Khaleel must be relieved now,6
Sam Curran did what Narine was supposed to,12
SANDYYYY,4
Sandeep channelling his inner Bhuvi,3
"**4.4** Sandeep Sharma to Curran, OUT, **knocked him over with a beauty.** Curran had no clue against Sandeep tonight. **35-2**

SM Curran  b Sandeep Sharma 31 (21b 3x4 2x6) SR: 147.61",2
SRH already in the tail. Time to get penetrate CSK harder,11
WELL FUCKING DONE MARK NICHOLAS,2
"You can go to sleep now. 

Thanks for watching.",6
Scurrans gone and i guess we're back to playing red ball cricket bois!,7
"ah shit, back to watching tuk tuk until 20th over (unless Watson gets going).",2
Why I thought we can have a good powerplay!!,1
You all are just pawns in the Sandeep Sharma redemption arc which started after the 2018 Finals,3
Off topic but how many overs can I watch with 700mb data?,2
Another reminder that we RTM'd Mohit Sharma but let Sandeep go,4
RIP CSK's run rate.,3
Sammy was low.... Watched csk score low... Over and over again,1
End of my dream.....Csk reality will slap our faces with the wicket,5
"Shyam Karan, can make a Bollywood movie with that name.",4
You can't beat a good 30 odd...,1
Mission accomplished. 30 runs scored.,2
"When Umesh sees khaleel, he gets a brotherly feeling towards him",3
Send in Jaddu/Bravo to make it crazy,2
What more do you need of Curran? 30 runs at 150 strike rate and bowls 4 overs.,5
Shit not so soon,2
Tfw you used up all the middle order you have by sending him as opener,2
"Well fuck, that‚Äôs basically the last batsman gone.",9
Curran better than 100% of the other openers in csk,5
Back to test cricket format again?,1
Took a great delivery to get him. Sandeep is quality today.,2
"Curran brothers are mediocre at best, only gets hype because swing is king",0
Why doesn‚Äôt Sandeep ever come up when we discuss Indian squad?,1
SR>6? Not on Thala's watch.,3
"CSK planned Curran to do this and Faf to stick around 
But oppsss",17
"Being SRH FAN, I feel for Curran, he gives some entertainment",8
"The rain in Hyderabad isn‚Äôt letting me watch Dugout:(

Edit- Now even the regular broadcast ain‚Äôt working.",5
Its Rayudu time... 2s become 1s and 1s become dots.,10
Sandeep Sharma is so polarising sometimes he is very good other times he is just so bad when he doesn't get help from pitch,6
"well done sammy, did his job. now pls keep this momentum going bois",1
Sam did his job. CSK had a decent powerplay. It's upto the oldies to get the total to.. uhm 130?,39
"Sandeep ""Bhuvaneshwar "" Praveen Kumar "" Kumar "" Sharma",10
A wicket away from the tail now,7
Did Rayudu come out with Faf's bat?,4
My body is ready for a quickfire 40 (38),22
What a pathetic innings by Sam. Has no respect to Test Matches.,32
Sandeep Sharma - another bowler that r/Cricket has memed into god tier form.,7
"i still don‚Äôt understand why we open faf, he‚Äôs shown he‚Äôs way better and more consistent  1 down",4
Pls watto fire cause there's a long line of tuktuk coming,4
CSK fans look at the positives. You're going at 7.5 RR. That's like 3 more than the usual,10
Mark Nicholas has the worst commentator curse,5
Rr 4 an over from now on till 16th over,3
"Sandeep Sharma can cause havok if we play him in our next England tour, considering Bhuvi is so injury prone now.",1
I really hope Rayudu would run quickly between the wickets after that horrible last innings.,5
Should bowl out Sandeep here instead of keeping his 1 over for the death overs.,2
I N T E N T‚Ñ¢,1
"And just like that, our chances of a high score dissapeared",2
"Mark Nicholas is a professional commentators curse

Still not as good as when Warner was on 97:

""he's never got out in the 90s""

Gets out next ball",3
INTENT^TM,3
R-r-r-rayudu?,1
Literally missed a straight ball lol,1
Rayudu with that brilliant shot,1
"Watson and raydu...hmmm...
Guess 2's are off the menu boyss",5
Warner should bowl out Sandeep.,1
"CSK atleast show some intent today, Sam has given you a decent start",5
Chahar could be really good on this pitch,1
3D glasses were needed to see Sandy properlyüòé,1
Watson looking like a disappointed dad during that Curran dismissal.,20
Sandeep sharma suddenly looking World class with those figures against CSK,9
Faf is a middle order batsman. Why does he even open?,6
Why didnt Dhoni come at #4?,2
Sandy Sharma india test debut when,1
Is Rayudu returning to his MI roots now.?,4
Rayudu garu has emptied a bottle of Mountain dew,5
INTENT^(TM),9
P O S I T I V E I N T E N T,11
both batsmen are reluctant runners. it is gonna be fireworks or tuktuk special.,7
CSK 100 all out in 15 overs to prove a point about *intent*?,10
They are going all out today..no tuk tuks,4
"What a great powerplay this is.

Great swing bowling and smashing bad balls.",3
Jaddu all padded up,4
Sanjay Bangar shut the fuck up with your positive intent already.,3
Csk has got intent today.,3
Jadeja's padded up too.....CSK onto something,9
"Seems like no one gonna play tuk tuk today 
Do or die",3
If Sammy had just tried to twat that as far as he could he would have been fine,3
Can't believe I actually saw SCurran opening the batting. What an unbelievable experience.,8
Intent intent intent intent,3
Ummmmm so liek can we remove intent from the csk batsman ty,2
Curran was a interesting YouTube ad which we could not skip. We are back to normal content.,14
Rayudu couldn't play that shot against Saini.,4
Rayudu has INTENT,5
so England's middle order has Buttler Stokes Archer and Curran? Damn.,12
"INTENT, intent... you want intent? Take this you redditors....",3
The ball does swing a lot more in this stadium than the other 2.,1
baby you're my cvv and i'm your otp :),6
Ambati ‚ÄúStaying in your crease is overrated‚Äù Rayudu,5
Warner brings 3D to bowl against you know who                                                                  Warner - I am somewhat of a Tactician myself,0
Rayudu wants to seal his spot for the next game ... Lol... As if Dhoni is gonna drop him in the first place.,1
Honestly Curran is going well beyond what is realistically expected of him. It‚Äôs gone from no one expecting him to be playing at all to opening and Being one of the better bowlers.,19
Keep Watson as an opener and send Fafdu in at 3 or 4. Don't understand why CSK is making him open.,6
WTF.  This can't be our CSK. This one has Intent smeared all over it.,4
No tuk tuk today i guess,2
"Fuck ya Rayudu,get your 3d glasses ready.",5
"Everyone is showing intent today , good start by Curran today but faf still playing would have been a good result",4
2 lazy runners in the crease. A run out incoming?,7
Watson and Rayudu. Why am I getting PTSD?,10

We are back guys. Rayudu and Watson,1
I don't know what guardian angel saved Rayudu there,5
Sandeep Sharma 3 - 0 - 10 - 2,3
Rayudu showing intent right from the first ball. For him it‚Äôs personal against Vijay Shankar in srh,3
[deleted],12
3 number 7s in their top 7 ahah,4
"Today i learned, Watson can give strong competion to Telegu movie villain's",4
Another Wicket and into CSK's tail,5
It will be 90 all out or 190 .... prediction,4
Oh man cant wait for 3D vs Rayudu,4
"Q from a cricket noob here. What exactly makes one batsman hit harder than the other if they're both of same strength? Why does Rayudu not hit as strong as say, Curran for instance?",4
Everyone prepare the SLOWDOWN,6
Curran shouldve waited for the left arm spinner :(,4
"Wow, Shane Watson looking like an absolute JCB unit.",6
Looks like CSK want to sustain the left right combo,1
Take a shot every time INTENT is mentioned on Dugout.,9
Lol replay of the wicket shows Curran looking like that kid caught with his hand in the cookie jar and watson looking like a furious father,10
CSK batting gives me so much anxiety jeez,5
"What will Sunil G say after Nadeem takes a wicket?

\- 'Shahbaz' Nadeem",7
"So Curran gets to open to batting and open the bowling now?


Is he the bat owner?",56
"I think Sam Curran did his job that he was assigned. Moreover, this was his first time as an opener and I think he did OK.",13
Who has nadeem replaced?,3
All those people abusing Sandeep last game and asking him to be dropped. He has an occasional bad over but over the years he has performed for every team he played in. Gem of a guy. And unplayable on his day. It's a boon for us that we have him when Bhuvi was injured.,29
Rayudu hates SRH man he will fire today.,0
Left arm spin v watto oh no,3
Top captaincy to bring in Nadeem right now,6
Want Vijay Shankar to bowl to Rayudu.,5
I'd like to see 3D Vijay Vs 1D Rayudu,11
Watson at that godly 30 strike rate,1
SCurran is CSK's best player and  is definitely up for MVP this season.,6
Gaikwad or jagdeeshan in for karn/chawla. Tahir in for watto. Sorry but watto is done.,2
Why is Basil Thampi not playing?,2
YJB giving Rizwan a run for his money in who can be the loudest behind the stumps,2
Guys is playing Dream11 any worth? or it's just another scammy stuff?,1
Watson is either making a 90 or a 30 ball 35. No middle ground,15
I think we are going to see a rare CSK all out today,13
KXIP and CSK fighting hard for the 8th spot.,9
Interesting everyone but watto batting aggressive for csk,7

"Once dhoni retires from IPL, who'll be the new face of CSK? It feels like an era is coming to a close for csk once he does. Always imagined the two together",17
Impossible,3
Man that is INTENT,10
Proper intent from Rayudu,1
Watching Kohli & then these guys really puts into perspective how important these 2-3 dot balls in an over become.,7
Let's hope sacrificing a great batsman in Abhishek for an extra spinner is worth it,-1
"Mark my words: CSK to get 150+ score today.

Right now it is not even end of power play",12
Remember Deccan Chargers' legend Thirumalashetty Suman?,41
"Watson is gonna pull a 2018 finals, just watch",22
Good powerplay for CSK.,12
Bowl Shankar you cowards,11
Why 3d and no Abhishek?,3
That is supposed to be our score at 10 over mark LMAO.,7

"Guys , I gotta remind you one thing



*Ben stokes will play tomorrow with full practice*",6
Power outage here. Any tips on how to watch cricket on data conservatively?,5
"Rayudu: ""i may only be one-dimensional but that dimension is the four""",11
"This is a good start for CSK. If they don't lose wickets and slog in the middle overs, they just might put a 165+ target.

And SRH will chase that in 18 overs, but still.. It'll be a good change for CSK.",7
Half the runs in powerplay were given by Khaleel in single over,3
"Curran did his job i think. Had we not lost faf, this is a very good position",2
Rayudu showing intent?!,1
Getting Lagaan‚Äôs Guran vibes from Rayudu,2
"This seems to be match 1 rayudu

Good for csk

Just waiting for watto to join the party",1
Curran handsome without the headband,6
Good call saving rashid,3
Gentle reminder : in 2018 SRH topped the table with 9 wins but their main nemesis was Rayudu. He inflicted 2 defeats and scored a lot of 6s. SRH's nemesis in the final? This old man called Watson. Interesting passage of play this.,5
Rayadu just trolling,4
[deleted],57
"Rayudu playing with 3D glasses.

Can see and time the ball really well.",2
"Barely any singles, only boundaries by these two",7
Watson needs to be dropped. Have jagadeesan open the batting with curran and faf at 3. Get hazlewood for bravo and tahir for watson. This will strengthen the team and also give a good fast bowling option.,2
Of course the gamble worked. Faf went first ball and Watson has 4 off 11.,9
Dont let Watson dig in and settle ffs,9
I almost thought a devotional song was playing at the stadium lol,9
I like today's bowling lineup. Sandeep bowling 3 of his overs at start and Natarajan starting late and can bowl more at death. Khaleel is out of syllabus man. Don't even know what to expect from him.,3
"Curran looked like a young, juvenile Stuart Broad after he got bowled",7
Y the fuck won't u go for nattu and donate 22 runs in an over?,1
Wtf dugout didn't show two deliveries,3
Vijay Shankar should bowl out Khaleel's remaining quota. Won't do much worse than Khaleel,3
Wattooo!,4

Oh no,1
PTSD,4
I'd like to see Rayudu making a decent score and then SRH winning the match.,3
Watson has to be packing the thickest chest in IPL.,1
Why did Sam play the wrong line? Did ball hold its line or Sam erred at reading the line?,7
Oh yes bash him watto,5
[removed],8
Classic Watson shot.,6
"‚ÄúCSK have always been such a fun team to watch‚Äù

2020 CSK: Exists",13

"Srh r fucked now

Everyone batting with intent

180 loading",15
"CSK with the ""We're going down but we are going to take you with us"" approach.",12
That six reminded me of the 2018 finals.,10
Is this CSK's fastest 50?,0
"Watson looks good, he's gonna penetrate us like he did in the 2018 final. We're done.",10
The difference between most teams and Csk is by now they wouldn't have as many dots and rather a lot more singles and probably a few twos as well.,16
Watson plays dangerously beautiful <3,11
CSK are 100% winning this.,6
Kohli with pagdiü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,8
How is Watson against Rashid?,4
Madhuri thicc!,-1
Natarajan's neckbeard looks awful,5
Is amitabh gonna talk about the millions of Indian indentured servants used to build dubai or nahhhhhh,2
"Friendship ended with Altroz, Renault Kwid is new best friend",3
Watson's reflexes have taken a beating...just got his bat down on time to dig the Yorker out..,1
i think curran did his job. they were stuck at 4 rr before he went off. came out of pp with 7.5 rr and that's pretty good for csk.,5
Play our Rashid and target everyone with intent.,4
That throw lmao,6
The average age of CSK's lineup is 31.5 years old. Remove Curran and it's 33.6 years old,16
"Shane Watson Strike Rate (Last 3 years)

1-10 balls - 101

11-20 balls - 153

21-30 balls - 175

30+ balls - 177",7
Srh doing what kkr did with csk,6
Please bolw out Sandeep as soon as possible.,5
So many bits of sloppy fielding leading to overthrows this year,5
Rayudu had a much bigger role in MI.,2
Just cause you got a boundary doesn't mean rest of the balls should be dots. Rotate strike ffs,6
Why is select dugout better than the English commentary?,3
Stupid keeping from Bairstow,3
"Damn, that run to 4?",5
Last I remember few years back Watson was in similar situation only to be revived back by SRH in finals with a century.,7
Dropped the match. Rayudu likes SRH,13

How the hell did that go for a four...,6
Watto can still wreck us single handedly.,1
Watto shawttttt,4
Question: does muscle power matters to hit a boundary?,6
One man's intent is other man's nightmare,5
What's wicket alert in dug out,1
Rashid Khan doing the most despite knowing the ball will reach the ropes lmaoo,4
He needs to bowl the one which keeps low and slides through...trap the batsman lbw or bowled,2
"N historically rayudu dominates Rashid as well

I guess srh needed an express bowler atleast for today",1
INTENT is sexy,6
wow 4 balls without a dot,4
"SRH : exists 
 
Watson : It's free runs",2
Scenes here if Dhoni was the one who dropped that,18
Waiting for Thala now,3
Csk would've got another 10-15 runs. only if they rotated the strike a bit more,5
I'm shit scared looking at these two at the crease.,1
"Rashid having PTSD of a fired up 2018 Rayudu and 2019 Watto who tore into him.

I will quit Reddit if SRH loses to CSK today.,18
Watto can't run for his life ffs,2
Rashid vs senior citizens!!,2
Play him out....play him out,0
Rashid with a no ball?,0
Badri is quite a chilled out dude himself. Couldn't guess that watching his more sedate batting.,7
The way Watto played Narine last time around. Him facing Rashid doesn't inspire much confidence.,3
oh no 2 dots,2

They should run some 2s on this massive groundüò°,5
Rabada miles ahead,2
i had war flashbacks from the glares rashid used to give to watson lmao,7
Those two casual reverse sweeps off Rashid by the Lord‚Ñ¢ should be in ipl 2020 compilation,8
Warner is the best foreign player over the years.,7
Curran would be putting Rashid in the stands rn,11
At least these finished fucks are maintaining a decent RR,1
Fuck me Rashid's economy is 4.99. Wtf is this guy on?!!,36
Even the dugout is boring today. Get Swann in there.,2

Csk‚Äôs batting is so painfully slow it‚Äôs not even funny,1
"When u realise watson did a tewatia against srh before ""doing a tewatia"" was a thing",11

Warner and Bairstow gonna take the singles and doubles Rayudu and Watson are refusing,5
Damn Rashid's over always seems to just go by super quick.,8
64 from 9 might not seem bad for CSK but the guy who made the bulk of the runs and that too at a solid SR is gone,8

"Everyone : why are you smiling, the RR is just 7!

CSK fans : you wouldn't get it!",18
Bowl Shankar. At least I‚Äôll get some entertainment out of itS,7
4.99 rpo in T20 is just crazy. Even for ODI these days it's sort of better than average.,9
You hear 'intent' more than Altroz these days...,6

My will to live is gonna take a Ceat Tyres strategic timeout if CSK keep playing tuktuk,45

Bowl out Sandeep now else a 20 run over in the death...,3
17 wickets from 7 matches in T20 is fucking Godtier,19

Dring everytime csk converts 2 to 1 and 1 to dot.,11
Does Murali have cross eye?,5
Most predictable answer why do questions like this even get asked,6
Its Archer vs Rabada tmrw btw,4
Almost all the balls bowled to Watson by a left arm spinner will be a leg side wide if left alone lol,2
Eeek !,2
Murali like because**,1
the tuk tuk has begun,2
Bruh even with all the intent CSK is barely managing 7 RPO this is sad to see,3

Someone please provide these two gentlemen batting in the middle with wheelchairs. Atleast then they can take quick runs,5
"For all the intent, CSK is still scoring at less than 7 an over.",12
Who did Murali say they were missing?,6
damn got to see the full version of kamla pasand ad.,7
Murali is such a positive person..Always gives good vibes,8
69/2 and 22 runs came off one Khaleel over. Hmmmm.,4
Murali seems like such a wholesome dude.,9
Have we had anyone on-field be mic'd up yet? That's always decent fun,4
Csk going back to their old ways,1
I want 100 in next 10 ...and also watson to fire,3
Just gib me one Shankar over. I can‚Äôt even watch with the rain but I be happy knowing they faced off,2
[deleted],11

Can SRH chase 140 on this pitch?,3
"fek. csk batting is so boring. they can't win this game, much less reach the playoffs with this approach.",4
"Other teams plan: Let's play out Rashid 

CSK plans: Let's play out everyone",20
"Guys, are we back to ""no INTENT"" conversation again?",3
"Please, Watto. 170. Any less, SRH would chase it with 10 wickets to spare.",3
We're slowly coming back to our regular shitty batting.,8
How the fuck did they not run 2 there?,1
We would be like 40/3 if Bhuvi was playing lol,9
[removed],7
22 of these runs were from one over.,3
"Run rate 6.90, score also 69. Nice",9
Nadeem just reminded me of me üòÅ,8
"Don't know why CSK defend Rashid so much, at least take singles off him",3
"Williamson being voted least important overseas player for SRH

*Bullshit*",12
Lmao this Batting lineup begins at Sam Curran and ends at Sam Curran,13
Just play reverse sweep goddamit,3
"CSK killed Bravo's batting potential. He's nothing but tailender for them for years. 

Pity.",2
that was a 2,3
"Hopefully this is the last over we play out, we need to see spark after that decent start",2
Lmao nadeem cant pick up the ball,2
Seeing increasing instances of teams and players trying to be on score 69 for at least 1 ball,2
MARO BC,1
They just took a fishing single off that misfiled,3
At least 100 runs in next 9 overs.,0
"For some inexplicable reason, i just love murali. What a cheerful guy, smile just seeing him",8
"Naeem was worried about second run, while rayudu and watson were worried about first run.",11
YRKFA is probably one of the best things that happened to SRH.,3
nadeem trying his best to tempt them for a second run,4
Loving CSK batting as an SRH fan,4
"When are they planning to accelerate, 160 seems like a good score here...",2
CSK has 11 batsman and still fail to show  I N T E N T,3
‚ÄúhEy MuRaLi WhErE‚Äôs YoUr NoTeBoOk‚Äù,4
*yawnnnnn*,0
"Oh no Rashid, hope he is okay.",2
Imagine searching for a 5th bowler when Murali and kanos can bowl u 8 picking half the wickets,3
What was that question by Sunny g to Murali about note book?,2
Can't remember the last time I saw someone hit a boundary off a spinner.,1
This IPL is the best chance for DC or RCB to win. Rarely would you find Csk play shite like this. And surely they're gonna come back with a better strategy next year.,11
2nd drop by SRH today,1
"This is where CSK  loose middle overs , no running no pushing for 2s",12
A lot of team have been around 70/2 after 10 overs when batting first. But only with CSK do I get the feeling that they'll just tuk tuk their way to 135-140 runs.,8
Murli is just a fun loving guy,4
"Every interview they do mid game may as well be:

Q: Do you think you have some good players?

A: Yes we have good players we like to think

Q: Very interesting. And tell me, does your team like to win cricket matches?

A: Yes we do, so we always try our hardest to win

Q: *audible shock* Well that is very illuminating. Thank you for joining us today. Good luck",94
Rayudu's intent vanished after 5 balls,16
"After a good start, Normal service has resumed with CSK batting",9
"Csk is so scared of Rashid. Just fucking look at tewatia , guy single handley belted Rashid  left and right",6
"Lol look at that guy using the words ""csk, finalist n sure "" in a same sentence 

Fuck doing tewatia,  I need that kinda confidence in my life",8
Murali flexing on us with Sri Lanka's people actually listening to lockdown restrictions,29
I swear if Rashid gets injured I'll quit cricket,19
Should never put the hand in between after the batsman has just rocketed a shot towards you. Kohli did that yesterday with Bravo too.,0
"Ah, typical CSK. The moment Curran got out the RR has just slumped lol",8
"In 2018 Football World Cup, Spain Tiki-Taka(d) their way outside the tournament. 

In 2020 IPL CSK is going to NRR their way out of the tournament.",6
Tewatia would reverse sweep that,6
Ah we love you Sunny G!,2
CSK have a pack of horrible runners. Even MSD nowadays is not upto the mark (still one of the better ones).,4
I don't hate csk but this tuk tuk innings is so boring to watch. Before atleast they could convert it into a good score,2
Muralitharan is such a lovable person.,6
Looks like it is business as usual for CSK,6
Why the fuck CSK batsmen give Rashid so much respect?? He just got hit by Tewatia last match. He isn‚Äôt Homelander,7
"If you can't beat him, BEAT HIM !!!",3
Well done parag,2
God it's so sterile batting. absolutely bored,3
Garg is a gun,8
"Poor KXIP, could have easily been in the Top 5 but are last",7
The problem with the CSK's batting this year is their running between the wickets. You can see almost 50% deliveries are dots here in 10 overs of game.,12
The fielding at the ropes has been exceptional this season. We've seen so many boundaries and sixes saved than in previous seasons.,5
"Oof that was a close one? Hope Rashid is OK. Thag being, were there any cottom balls this ipl?",1
No wonder Rayudu failed yoyo test.,4
"how did rayadu get so washed up?
he was pretty good wasn't he?",8
Murlidharan is anti Brendon McCullum,5
"With the notebook question, murli was basically like ""they have small brain, i have big brain I don't need no notebooks.""",16
Remember when Murali fucked England in England,11
Ez 170,0
CSK will reach 100 in the 16th over,1
"Oddly enough, this sort of safe batting in the middle overs is a malaise that affects the Indian T20 side as well. This is despite having players like Pant and Pandya in the team.",2
[deleted],2
Those cred ads are so cringe,2
"Just 13 runs of   last 3 overs with no wickets falling

Just csk things",1
"Anyone else think, not playing Rayudu in last WC was the best decision? Because we'd already seen this Dhoni-rayudu **anchoring role in death overs** during NZ series.",1
Y'all talking shit about CSK better not jinx them,0
"Hopefully run rate picks up, otherwise Ape, Bajaj and TVS will be looking to become CSK's sponsors",0
SR <100 after 10 balls will never not piss me off in T20.,4
"Stark: Wtf are you doing?

Dr. Strange: I'm looking at different scenarios where this CSK team faces itself.

Stark: How many did you see?

Dr. Strange: 14,000,605

Stark: How many ended in a tie?

Dr. Strange: 14,000,605. And that's not all, I've now lost the will to live.",9
"Rayudu is building partnership, he must have some plans.",7
Bowl Shankar to Rayudu you cowards,7
"Damn CSK sans Curran was already scoring at <6 an over

AND then Rashid came!!!",2
Both these batsmen need a boundary somewhere,0
"I could never differentiate between Nadeem and iqbal, they look the same and r both left arm spinners",0
Expecting Intent from CSK = Expecting a Penguin in the desert,2
you don't play these many dots in a t20 match. this is awful,1
"Can't wait for the time Ash gets to be a commentator, man will ask good questions instead of these time waste questions",5
Watson stopped using front foot?,0
These guys are settling nicely... Will start their attack soon,1
"petition to drop the entire team other than curran, thakur, and chahar",5
Tunak tuk tunak tuk,2
Someone remind Rayudu that the audition for no 4 odi spot is no longer open,5
CSK showing 0 improvement in 7 matches. How can a top tier team be so shit,0
Why don't they have a left hander batting now,0
"8th time ""intent"" has been used this match",0
Only 13 off the last three overs. SRH putting on a squeeze of sorts here.,0
Pretty boring match so far aside from the powerplay.,1
What is this shit batting,1
"Dread it, run from it, CSK's RR < 7 still arrives.",1
I am disgusted by CSK‚Äôs batting,0
"Remember when Watson and Rayudu smashed Rashid and all other SRH players in 2018.

Yeah, I remember, those were the days :_(",5
"Someone please dissolve csk, its annoying to watch.",2
Wow,1
Pandey is fire on the field.,2
Fuck,1
!!!,-2
Yay!,-2
120 should be defendable right boys? Boys.....?,17
Good on Pandey ji. He is not sure.,2
[deleted],3
CMV: Manish Pandey looks like a dollar store  Vicky Kaushal,-1
Umpire playing for CSK by saying the soft signal for Watto is not out lol,2
Maybe they should have sent Jaddu or Bravo in,2
Pandey ji,3
Good guy Pandey.,9
Pandey dont leave us hanging tf,4
Grounded,3
"Hmm, Rayudu came out with a lot of intent and is still striking less than 100.  Excellent bowling!",3
When did Indian fielders become the good guys,4
Oho missed,2
Johnnys booming ‚Äúcaaaaatch‚Äù honestly makes me hard,8
Full points for fair play,5
These Dream 11 fans look like specimens in a virtual Zoo.,10
I thought these guys were scoring well and they are going at less than run a ball? How?,3
whether he's out or not out it doesn't matter,0
Fair play points go brrrr,1
He did it on purpose to keep the partnership going,2
Pandey amazing as always,5
Specialist fielder failing to catch,4
Ffs someone get going pls,2
Think pandey knew straight away tbf,2
"This is a slow wicket. The worst thing you could do is to take 20-25 balls to settle and then get out,  because it is very difficult for a new batsman to get going from ball one.",5
[deleted],-4
I understand not going after Rashid but atleast smack nadheem pls.,2
5D thinking from Pandeyji,5
That's going to send up straight to the top of the all important Fair Play table,3
Pandey really wants the Fair Play points,4
Watson don't save all your runs for the IPL final lol,3
21D reverse ludo by Pandeyji to drop Watto,4
3 lifelines to CSK till now,3
I'm sure the soft signal is based on the fielder's reaction after catching,4
It is no surprise CSK has given up on the tournament already. It was the logical next step after giving up matches.,2
"Should've sent Jadeja or Bravo, at least they hit boundaries. Why can't we have one accumulator - one power hitter partnerships.

Also, Jadeja and Bravo never get the chance to bat and make a difference because our stupid openers consume all the balls.",5
Every team I've supported has lost the match when I watch on TV. I'm supporting csk today but I might consider turning off the tv,5
Now that's some intent Daddy,2
Pandey ji gaining fair play points,4
Rayudu with INTENT‚Ñ¢,4
Fucking finally,3
Nice guys finish last. So csk will end 8th position.,2
How much does the bowling team's celebration affect the soft signal?,6
Did they use drs,-1
This is Called INTENT,2
Nadeem so unlucky today,3
Pandey earned fairplay points for SRH but fans are not impressed üòî,3
"Dont worry guys, we have sam curran to hit.
Oh wait",16
Get Watson out. He could play all the overs and score 150.,3
Rayudu plays that shot a lot,3
"Like I said , [here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/j8jetr/match_thread_25th_match_chennai_super_kings_v/g8c02ie/?context=3) this isn't the worst position for CSK but they need 
 power hitter to salvage this position and I don't think they have any.",2
I have this good knack of picking captains who fail considerably,2
Rayudu hit a six. 3 dots will follow now,2
"To every one asking why are these players defensive against Rashid, taking risks against him in the last 4-5 overs while chasing difficult target is one thing, out of form players who are struggling against Nadeem trying to imitate Tewatia against Rashid in 10th over is whole another deal",4
Is it just me or does the umpire with a stubble look like Ringo Starr?,0
"CSK's batting can be related with reverse plot of the movie ""SPEED"" 
If you try to go fast you'll blow",2
Now tuk tuk thala should come to bat,2
"See, that's the thing which irritates CSK fans. The batsmen can hit beauts. Just that they aren't doing it",8
Csk saving up nrr for next edition of tounrney you plebs.,4
"If we look at bottom 4 teams:

RR is giving regular chances to Parag and Tyagi

SRH is giving regular chances to Priyam Garg and Abhishek Sharma

KXIP is giving regular chances to Bishnoi and now Arshdeep also

CSK is making Sai Kishore, Jagadeesan and Gaikwad warm benches for old, unfit players. Gaikwad got 2 chances out of order and thats it. He is such a good opener that Gill has to bat down the order sometimes for India A just to accomodate him.",9
Playing spin off the front foot. What is this?,1
This is intent,4
Daddy Watto with his BIG DICK. What a SIX,2
Hell yeah. Back to back.,2
Woow,3
26 runs in last 5 overs with no wickets lost. Disgraceful,3
[removed],1
"Wait, was that why the guy who caught the ball didn't celebrate at all? So as to not look sus?",4
"If he celebrates that properly, the soft signal is out and then it may not have been overturned",1
"Shahbaz shouldve thrown it wide, Rayudu used his feet about 5 times against him now.",2
Watson playing 20+ balls is no good sign for opposition,6
"Shane 'Big Match Player' Watson

Arre BC if we don't get to the playoffs we won't have any big matches to play. Wtf is this shit.",5
Watson to play a blinder today and shut us all up?,7
Watson show is about to begin !,1
Lesssgoooooo,2
I wish Watson got out there TT_TT,3
Watching a Dynasty at its end is hard,9
Bad ball,5
Looks like I jinxed it hehe,1
he forgot and took the catch and then asked for DRS,2
[deleted],5
Tewatia Cameo,2
"Nadeem did pretty well, had some chances missed. A missed catch from Bairstow and a drop from Manish.",4
*Wait why it looks like it happened before. I can see flashbacks*,5
"Last 2 balls: 12 runs

Last 2.5 overs before that: 14 runs",9
finally some fucking action,2
"Honestly all csk matches are so boring to watch.
Might as well sleep very early than this.",3
Watson put his entire width into that one,8
Watson not like rashid. Watson angry. Watson tonk.,22
"Nobody:                                                                                     .


Commentators: Intent",6
They'll get to 300 by the end of the 50 I think,8
this would be such a good partnership if these guys could run between the wickets faster than at a snails pace,6
Genuine Q. What causes Watson to instantly start hitting harder after 30 or so balls?,6
"Why does Bangar never get any off days? Why does he start screaming whenever he has to call the action? Why does he try so hard?

So many questions.",5
"Fleming strategy - If all CSK batsmen play like Thala, no one can blame Thala.",16
Watson on one knee üòç...The ball disappears,2
*Watson PTSD intensifies*,4
Both striking better than kholi ü§ó,-6
Yeah do it. Just like always bring all out of form guys and teams back in form.,4
"48 balls, 70-80 runs will take it to 160 approx. And I think that's defendable if you break the opening partnership early.",5
"If Pandey celebrated, I'm not sure that would've been overturned bc the soft signal would've been out",3
Snooze fest so far (‚îÄ.‚îÄ||Ôºâ,2
We haven't had a proper low scoring thriller this season. This can be one,2
Does Watson not run doubles at all? Is it an injury thing or what?,1
Jadeja better do a Tewatia,2
"People getting angry at Watson for playing like this, but this is how Manish Pandey plays every game",21
[deleted],9
We're fucked today. 2 overs left off Khaleel near the death.,8
First ball six and then just 2 runs.,2
Finally suryakumar yadav getting some light. Has been a wall for MI in the previous 2 seasons.,6
[deleted],5
SRH should win this without losing any wickets.,1
6 of the first ball 2 runs of the next 5 INTENT ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è,7
Reminder that it is pretty impossible to lose batting first if you play decently unless you are DC against MI.,8
this soft signal thing is stupid. Just let the third ump decide. Same with umpires call in lbw,5
What a weird innings this is. It feels like CSK are going too fast and then I see the RR @ 7 RPO.,3
In b4 Thala's 19(21),6
CSK are playing very well. They can easily get 180 from this stage.,3
Watson will play the biggest innings of his career. How's that for a jinx?,2
"CSK really pushed the ""experience beats youth"" thing this year. These oldies cannot take the heat in UAE.",2
this game is two fanbases who have no faith in their team saying they‚Äôre fucked even tho there‚Äôs a clear winner here,6
Banger is horrible. Hot the fuck he managed to get into dugout. Even Mukund and Badri are better than him.,4
BoAts ad is pretty cool .,2
Will delete my account if CSK get over 170,2
Whats your thoughts on the Curran experiment?,5
SRH and CSK playing their 2nd match at the same venue. Should've changed it for variety.,1
Man one bad season and y'all are shitting on CSK like they're India Z or something smh,3
If they score 200 then I guess dropping Abhishek might cost us.,-1
Sad seeing Tahir be the Glove Boy :(,17
"CSK mate, just cause you've hit one boundary doesn't mean you can then take singles and dots for the next 3 overs",8
"Rahul and Pandya's BOAT ads look dope.
Dhawan's is okay. 

Iyer's is outright comical. Not sure if he's suited for television tbh lol",2
Scared Sandeep still has an over left. Please bowl him out ffs,3
"feel srh is going to lose again to csk, that one victory was bittersweet af, got the w but lost bhuvi",3
Why do they assume the jobs's done after hitting a 6. Rotate the strike ffs.,3
Purple cap holder doing what junior players do. Wtf CSK?,8
Sad to see last year's purple cap holder carrying the drinks,3
"Come on, send in Lord Kalol you cowards",2
Six of the first ball and just 2 in the next 5.,3
CSK has Tahir? Why isn't he playing?,1
Thala please come and add your contribution in this snoozefest,5
Tahir is the waterboy :(,5
"This might sound silly, but why don't other csk players exercise as much as Watson and become buff? Lot of people are thin  and if many have 6 packs, they could become stronk",3
Tahir running across the ground without taking any wickets.,3
At least we get to see tahir run. As an MI fan i am happy with that.,4
"Tahir, no, stay on the field :(",2
"F for Tahir, last year purple cap relegated to drinks :(",35
Aww that's so sweet of Tahir to run in with the gloves ü§ó Man with a heart of gold!,9
feel bad to see tahir in a bib,7
Is it wierd that I low-key feel bad for MS Dhoni?,11
12th man Imran Tahir's running vs His post-wicket celebration running,11
"Sanjay: ""Rayadu wanted to go arial"" ‡≤†_‡≤†",2
Wish Tahir gets some games,3
"7 overs remain

Rashid, Sandeep : 1 over each


Khaleel : 2 overs 


Nattu : 3 over",3
watto is a chonky boy.,3
"Peak Rayudu dancing down the track, having an ugly swipe at the ball with zero control and top edging it",4
"Is Rayudu,Siraj the only  Andhra/Telangana players in IPL?",6
"54 of 11 in boundaries

38 of 67 in remaining balls

Good test match batting

It is criminal even in odi nowadays",8
Lol why did they make tahir run all the way to give tissues? Dude is like 41 right?,4
It's sad seeing Imran Tahir not playing after his season last year,7
SRH needs lady luck now more than ever.,3
The Altroz and Fair Play Table are in a competition for the least fks given,10
Yeah take on the guy who can bowl Yorkers at will. High iq move this,8
Man I hope Tahir is making  $$$ cause this is just sad.,16
The way srh have cut off Rayudu's scoring options reminds me of peak Australian field settings vs Sachin and co.,8
What tha heck RR did to deserve that position on Fair play ?,1
Csk used to 45-50 / 2 at the end of 10 overs on good pitches...they are showing intent..may not be enough..,1
Only Played 13 overs also played 35 dot balls. Just CSK things.,7
35 dot balls so far. Dont see much difference today even though there seems to be more intent,2
Point blank Nattu,2
Feels hard for csk to justify curran and bravo ahead of tahir on this track,6
I hope csk gives one of santner or tahir to MI,-1
Now this is intent,1
Which day of the test are we at bois?,-2
"Anything over 130, SRH can't chase",2
Nattu where are your leg breaking yorkers man!!,1
"Calling it, 184.",3
"rayadu going so deep inside, I love it",7
Scenes if they're planning to bowl Khaleel during death,4
At this point being beaten by us is like having a 100 year old man break both your legs by throwing his dentures at your knees and then him sloowly walking over to you and bludgeoning to death with his walking stick.,13
I feel CSK has done OK till now. But do they have the fire-power to score 65-70 off the last 7?,7
csk shoulda played Tahir instead of bravo.,6
Srh getting other teams back into form. So selfless.,7
Rayudu making up for not playing the CWC 2019 by playing a solid ODI innings.,6
YORKERS!!!,0
"nice rayudu garu smacking srh, hurts the eyes. lovely player tho",2
did he just say fuck off lol,8
"No one cares about your fucking FairPlay awards, commentators. Teams care about winning. If he‚Äôs not sure if it carried or not, he‚Äôs not cheating, just check it with third umpire",6
Hahaha what was that scream of intent?,6
Duh why look for yorkers so early? Natrajan is good but he should work on variations.,3
When watson will trigger.....,1
What's the pace of Natarjan?,4
Watson Australia Test Match team when?,3
There is a distinct quality gap between the teams. Mumbai have the best team and you can see it from the batting vs other teams' batting. Delhi's bowling is great but their batting is still prone to mistakes. And RCB are still reliant on kohli and abd getting runs. Mumbai are favourites followed by delhi and rcb. I don't think anyone outside these three teams is winning the competition this year.,7
Fakir play award  is the biggest bullshit award....no one knows exactly what is taken into account...decimal points are involved...no one gives a fuck execpt the sponsors,12
a loud FUCK OFF from  Ambati,12
You can't say fuck off and expect the ball to just fuck off to the boundary Rayudu.,13
Watto not running 2s :(,2
time to go for a pee,2
....too late for 180?,0
wow 12 run over,0
10 runs but not bad they tried to hit every ball.,3
Should target 170+ from here.,5
Calling it now CSK will not make the playoffs,6
"Csk playing the whole over without any dot

When did that happen last time?",3
Adichu thoilangata boomers,6
They should easily get around 170 from here.,3
Score prediction? Mine is 166,5
What's the use of boundaries if there are gonna be a couple of dot balls following that,7
Absolute shite level commentary that by Sunny G lite,8
That's points taken off the fair play award there Rayudu,5
I can understand their strategy. If one of them gets out it probably brings dhoni in and he will further slow down the innings,5
Ceat Tyres time.,2
Out of context but which team have lowest rr in overs (7-15) ?,2
I frankly don't see anything above 150 guys I don't see how some people are predicting 180,3
Mo Siraj for Test team,2
Sometimes commentators should just shut the fuck up,3
:O,1
How long was that Watto six?,2
MI and CSK should trade Lynn for Tahir/Santner,7
What's the point of umpire then. It's umpire job to decide it's out or not.,1
12 an over will take CSK to 176 which is the minimum they should target,2
180 incoming for CSK!,0
"Csk scores 180 I guess ,if they keep going on this way.",2
I can't be the only one who thinks Natarajan's neckbeard looks absolutely horrendous,10
Rayudu has been a Rayudud  to be honest but I hope he can redeem himself.,2
"Instead of saluting Manish Pandey for doing the right thing. They're actually implying that he was trying to be dishonest there, and should've done more. Sometimes the commentators can fuck right off with their bs.",8
What is it with Watson and SRH? We can't take his wicket for fuck's sake,5
"CSK demotes Watson, promote Curran indicating that they need fiery openers..

Watson scores 34(34) at No.3

*Watson, ""dread from it, run from it, intent still the same""*",11
Not too bad till here. 160+ should be defendable. Lessgo.,2
Khaleel will come back and take one or two wickets securing his place. Dhokebaaz.,5
I am getting the feeling MSD would blast a few today.,6
Wait! Isn't Jagadeesan in the team?,4
These guys need to try for 2 sixes every over now. there are 6 overs to go and 8 wickets remaining! CSK have decent batters till number 9!,3
Khaleak has 2 more overs,2
"Me : minding my own job and jacking off to por

Rishabh Pant: ye main Kar leta, tum dream11 bano",6
Watto go bezerk or go home,2
[deleted],-6
Is it likely that if CSK found their 'momentum' they can go blazing wins all over their opponents from now on?,2
Tahir not playing is as much as a big deal if Rabada didn't play. Guy guaranteed you wickets,4
Will csk be able to field an 11 if yo yo test is made mandatory in ipl?,7
Am I the only one who feels CSK are having a high Run rate but you check it's just 7.5 üòÇ,11
You can expect a wicket this over,5
Daddy Watto. What a playaaa!!!,0
If they can get 60 off last 10 (Edit 6). This is actually not that bad off a batting performance.,-1
what's treating Rashid like a lil bitch!,5
Shit we r fucked,2
Rashid getting tonked by Watson is it 2018?,2
"Just joined, good to see Curran opening. How did he do?",3
Watson you beauty,2
Rashid get smashed,1

That's huge,5
Shot Watto!,4
Watto targeting Rashid = big pp move,1
Shit. Get Watson out.,1
6 of the first ball like his last over. Please do better than the 2 runs in next 5.,1
Watson and scoring against SRH is the greatest love story ever,3
Watto is the only person to cunt Rashid like that,8
**F U C K**,3
Kiddo getting figured out?,2
"Watson with three sixes still striking at 111 , need to reduce the dot balls and take the two's",2
Rayudu bruh you suck pls,1

KP just keeps saying same thing over and over again,5
Daddy Rayudu joins the party,6
Rashid getting clapped,7
I honestly just had a pikachu face looking at that 6 !!!!,7
Break Rashid and break SRH,7
CSK giving SRH 2018 PTSD,7
Lol the disrespect for Rashid,1
I'm literally crying right now,6
Hahahahah,0
Ambati joining the party!!,1
"Rashid getting tonked, it doesn't happen often, tewatia really did a number on him",9
"How is ‚Äújust survive Rashid‚Äù not a OP strategy against SRH? They seem to have nothing else in the bowling, but I see teams going after Rashid all the time.

Here again, this match is proof that CSK wins a lot of games based on management alone!",1
"Cmon Watto, I want an over with six sixes, you can do it!",1
Smaaaaaaaaaaaaack lmaoo was that pommy?,3
CSK showing whose the daddy,2
"More than half of both batsman's runs have come from boundaries, could have easily made 15-30 runs extra by converting dots into singles",3
"Having kept for Rashid for 2 seasons now, Bairstow might be able to pick his variations if they face each other on the international scene.",3

Rashid is getting hammered by Rayudu garu.,4
"180 on folks

Ipl is still alive 

Except for punjab",3
Rashid is no longer the mystery spinner. He has been figured out. And none other than lord tewatia,-1
[The most accurate meme of all time](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EkDzvMkU4AAB2Fw.jpg),12
I think KP might be on smAAAAAAAAAAAAck,4
Chawal and Karn gon get tonked today aren't they,1
30 of Rashid's 4. I'll take that anyday of the week.,5
KP definitely doing lines between commentary stints,2
Is this the first time Rashid conceding 30 in an innings this ipl?,5
4-0-30-0 Rashid is pretty fucking good for us ngl.,3
Even on a bad Rashid goes for just 30.,5
Lol warner hasn‚Äôt got Shankar to Bowl with Rayudu at crease,5
15 an over from here on will take CSK to 190 runs,3
Why 3D got no overs?,3
Arre bhai bhai bhai ye toh serious le liya! Someone free up a playoff spot for the yellow kit üòí,1
UwU Khaleel ji,2
Rash being taken to cleaners helps shatters the perception of his invincibility. The last match and this hitting if continues will give other batsmen some confidence facing Rash.,1
Man love the csk batting here,1
"I was thinking what is the point of wasting Curran at top if you undo his good work in middle overs. But Watson proving me wrong. He is great in middle overs, CSK might have solved their 6-14 overs problem with him at 3.",1
"*The ball is Virat Kohli*

Rayudu: *smashes hard*",3
Rayudu looks so frustrated with him. Each ball. Sometimes two times a ball.,1
Wait we don't even get to see 3D vs 3D?,1
"KP's ""smack"" should be in the cringe highlights",1
They are gonna bowl out khaleel now itself?,2
Ladies and Gentlemen it begins,1
"After smashing rashid, Watson bends his knee and thanks Lord Tewatia the one true god",5
Lol the fact that Rashid is getting smashed sure gives me hope for a decent score by csk to follow,2
What is up with 2020? Rayudu is showing intent XD,2
Bro how are we still only 116. Need 170 at least for our bowling lineup to defend.,3
The good news for CSK fans is that I selected Natarajan in my fantasy team so there will be two overs guaranteed to go at at least 20rpo in these last 5,6
"""Hey KP, what's your recreational drug of choice?""

KP: ""SmaaaaaaaaAAAaaaacccCcCCKKKKK""",9

*Lord Kalol has entered the chat*,5
Lmao. Khaleel getting a wicket with an absolute pie,5
"No rayudu, but played a good knock",3
Khaleel always gets rewarded for shitty balls. Not complaining though,2
"Rayudu has a neck tattoo?

TIL",2
Shit gets wickets,2
Lmao just threw it away,2
Ok.. I might have said something about getting the feels that  CSK might tuk tuk their way to 135. I want to retract that statement.,3
That was a  freebie full toss,2
Let‚Äôs gooo,3
"Death, taxes and Khaleel getting wickets on shit deliveries",8

Dhotni,2
"P sure waist high full tosses are q hard to get away, cuz you can't get a clean swing at them",2

Khaleel has ball in hand. Brace yourselves.,3
Dhoni shadow batting to get all offensive shots outta his system before going out to bat.,11
Well done Rayudu. Intent shown.,2
Jesus that was so soft,3
Mahi's walk of intent ??,5
Decent ODI innings from Rayudu.,1
C'mon MS flex them biceps,3

65 million years. Zap,0
And khaleel cemented his spot for next 3 matches smh,1
"Vaathi coming, othe.",3
"Thala ON, Runrate DOWN",3
If these two are not going to go crazy in the death and just get out they should at least try to run harder between the wickets and not just try to 'make it up' later by scoring boundaries (which wing happen if they get out like Rayudu here).,2
Time for some tuk tuk?,2
Lol after all that Khaleel takes wicket.,2
WTF are those sideburns of Khaleel?,2
dhoni better have brought the slog bat out now and not on the last ball,5
CSK in the mood today. Will need something top order to fire for SRH to win,3
Thala is in boys. Now we get to see 20 ball 50 and comms sucking him off for 2 more years after this.,4
"**15.2** Ahmed to Rayudu, OUT, **straight to long-off.** Friendly full toss wide outside off, about knee height. He hammers it to Warner's left and he crouches and takes that reverse cup **116-3**

I still fucking hate how CSK beat us all 4 times in 2018.,6
Khaleel is the definition of ‚Äúshit gets wickets‚Äù,2
All the ppl complaining abt khaleel getting wickets off pies...he is getting them pretty cocnsitently so who cares lmao,7
Khaleel always gets wickets of shitty balls right?,1
Oh my lord that was a shit delivery from Khaleel,1
how the fuck did that ball end up being a wicket,4
Khaleel keep picking wickets on utter shit deliveries. Some people are just very lucky.,5
If you can't run 2s you need to go Bang Bang like Gayle.... nothing in between,5
Thala special tonight,7
What's the hotstar viewer count?,3
Commentators are saying never underestimate the power of full toss. Just because you get a wicket with luck doesn't mean it's a great delivery,8
Yay dhonis is on strike srh fans rejoice,7
Being a Dhoni stan in 2020 is hard bhot hardd,5
Will we see an MSD apology thread today?,1
Never trust the bowling of a man with a beard that has identity issues,2
Dhenier off the mark,4
Ah the ability of khaleel where he bowls all full tosses and get wickets when the batsman miss times.,3
Captain of the boat is here,2
Khaleel always gets wickets of shit balls.,3
Dhoni is here Bois 20 in 20 innings,2
Dotni or Dhenier,2
Time for this sub to get charged.,2

Dhoni is gonna end us isnt it,1
Dhoni should do well today given SRH has no spinners remaining.,4
" Bravo hasn't batted once , bowling is average , why is he playing ?",4
Rashid giving sixes and Khaleel taking wickets. Now I have seen everything.,5
150 +/-5,1
"Thanks Khaleel, very cool.",1
"Misiing jadhav now

N blasting those cute defences",5
Someone needs to hold down Warner and shave off that hideous mustache.,10
Remember when Last time khaleel absolutely ‚ÄúRabada‚Äùed Dhoni,1
"We went from du Plessis at 3 to Watson at 3, weird",1
Khaleel seems like a fucktard and a pretty arrogant twat,2
I hope dhoni clicks here today,1
Thala masterclass in making.,2
"Rookie mistake by Khaleel there, could have had 3 dot ball",1
"KP: Dhoni's out there. Is he gonna up the tempo

Dhoni knocks it back towards the bowler and Khaleel slips so they take a single (nothing wrong with defending your first ball, don't get me wrong)

Dhoni super sprinter and Watto at the other end. Runouts definitely on the cards,7
I think warner needs to lose that mustache,3
"So now CSK has shown some intent in powerplay and middle overs, just need to sort out their death batting.",3
Is he going to up the tempo? Probs not,2
Khaleel doing a Tewatia,0
dheinere gonna make it rain here.,3
"Taking singles in the 16th over wtf is this. Bro he's Khaleel, not Brett Lee, he has the highest economy rate this match.",5
The one conclusion I have got from that Lenskart ad is that current Rohit Sharma ate 2008 Rohit Sharma,4
Thala raced other batsmen out the door so that he'd get to face Khaleel.,0
Tuk tuk tukiya dhobi,-2
Good ball,1
"Cmon MS, show us some magic",1
Rashid getting clapped and khaleel going for a wicket a 2 runs is the biggest surprise this match lmao,10

"CSK needs 5 victories from 7 matches to have a reasonable chance at qualifying whereas SRH needs 4 from 7. The table is shaping up nicely.
                Only MI and DC seem to be certain to qualify for the play-offs. Only KXIP seems to be without a chance. 5 teams fighting for 2 spots. It's exciting to be a cricket fan.",3
That was a huuuuge over for SRH!,2
"Unpopular opinion

Dhoni batting in second innings >>> First innings",2
Bruh after all that hitting Watson's SR is still <115. Kohli has spoilt us as far as strike rotation is concerned.,4
It's okay just seeing off Khaleel innit,3
Thala just dont start hitting at last over,4

Fun fact :- Tewatia scored more runs than dhoni in this year's ipl,5
Khaleel's beard might fall off by the end of this match,3

"You know when I said CSK might tuk tuk to 135, and then wanted to retract that statement. Yeah about that.....",2

Great odi innings from rayudu and watson,3
That's it boys. Bowl full toss to CSK men and reap the benefits.,4
Manish jus chilling,1
You would think filth like that wouldn't get 2 wickets exactly the same way,2
A team of has-beens,3
Crowd noise no intent,3
Will they make 140 now?,2
fuck me we lost two set batsmen to absolute filth wtf,2
Nattu gave a free hit to Watson and Watson gave a easy catch catch in return. FAIR PLAY POINTS PLS,6

"Sorry scotty, sawnny does it best yelling out TATA ALTROZ!!",2
I have a bad feeling for khaleel n sandeep here,3
"Altroz as flashy as Dhoni, now I see why r/cricket has so many issues with Altroz",4
Delhi capitalists,10
Dhoni must have quite the package because the comms keep coming back for sloppy sevenths,0
Watto should've waited for Sandeep ffs,4
I have a bad feeling about sandeep's over,5
"Full toss is so orgasmic to CSK, they forget to bat ü•¥",8
Won't even bother with Cricbuzz Hindi today if CSK wins today oh my god,0
Delhi 2014 (2 wins in 14 matches and NRR of -1.182) is the worst team in IPL history,4
Warner looks like an old Scotland Yard detective with a clip-on moustache,1
Don't ruin your figures Sharma ji,3
65 million years. Zap,0
Sandeep either gonna get tonked or gonna take Dhenier's wicket.,1
They showed the Altroz for one second and these clowns forgot about the match lol,2
This sub can shit it all it wants on Dhoni...he is Demigod in TN here...had it been the 90s he could have won an election here...,12
T Natarajan making Thala feel like Abd,7
"Wait wtf that 50 Jadeja scored earlier in the comp was his first ever IPL 50???

Wowee",6
"r/cricket when natarajan bowls 2 full toss for boundaries : 

oh dear oh dear gorgeous

Khaleel does the same and get wickets : 

You fucking donkey",11
So masks are optional I am guessing?,2
"Cunts not wearing their fucking masks properly winds me up more than most things nowadays

Wear it properly or just don't fucking bother",7
Agent Natarajan doing his part here.,3
Who's the oldest cricketer played in IPL besides Tambe and Hogg?,2
What's brijesh Patel doing there?,1
170 will be good,2
Dhoni's waiting for Nattu to bowl full pies.,5
Please get Warner a mask I can't look at that moustache,9
INTENT^(TM),5
I was surprised to see RR with the second highest yorker economy... but then I remembered that‚Äôs not a good thing,4
Lot of bollywood between bcci officials,4
They should just start off every match with players standing in front of the altroz and get it done with. People don't buy cars by being forced to watch it every game,5
"Dhoni :Hits 2 boundaries 

CSK fans : Everybody calm down it's happening!!!",14
Trademark Jadeja.,3
"Why Bravo is in team if he don't bat, better play Tahir then, he's lot better bowler than Bravo is.",2
"Thats how you do it.  
go bits n pieces my boy!!",2
Is it happening? Thala is hitting from the starting. I thought I would forget this sight.,1
"Last game Dhoni : 1,1,6, out


This game 1,0,1,1,4,4,0...........


Great by no means, but definitely a whole lot better than how he's been playing lately.",1
Sandeep takes off mask to reveal that he was Bhuvi all along.,5
"Badly missing

Kaske pakad

Jamke jakad

Lagaaaa

Helicopter frm 2011 cwc",4
I don't what Dhoni tells his partner even when the other batsman is scoring better than him.,2
[removed],1
Sandeep really is not a death bowler. He was amazing early in the match but gets thrashed later.,2
"This shovel shot for a single by MSD is brutal, seen it so many times in the past few years",1
The mask wearing in this tournament has been shockingly ineffective,2
"If CSK score 160, they can back themselves to defend this total, will be tough yes, but we have seen chasing can be difficult.",2
jadeja always hits in 3rd man initially. poor fielding placement imo,3
"Dhoni hits a fulltoss


Commentators:  power!! Timing!!

Bhenchod,  it's a fucking full toss!! Everyone hits it for 4!",5
Why hasn't 3D bowled today?,5
Shot Jaddu!,4
Piyush Chawla would look like the comic Kenny Sebastian if he loses his weight,6

"Holy shit, he almost flew*",5
Oh my god that was a great dive üëèüëèüëè,1
Why TF is Dhoni not trying to smash Sandeep???!,1
whoaaa,4
Did he jam his balls,1
Why kill yourself trying to get Dhoni out,20
Dhoni cursed Sandeep too,3
That would‚Äôve been one of the best catches ever if it happened.,15
That would have been catch of this season. What the fuck. Hope he is not injure d,20
Uh oh.,3
Wow. Almost.,5
What a way that would have been to bring up your 100th IPL wicket,6
Jason momoa injured. Need khaleesi massage,5
Wew..what an attempt,6
Simone Biles would have been proud of that effort,5
wow what an effort,10
That jump wasn‚Äôt worth it :/,6

That moustache of Warner gives me 90s sex offender vibes/s,13
Oh fuck the hand hope he is okay,9

What? Don't tell me he's injured too now...,7
"Finally Jaddu hits a boundary. Has ""Jadeja - the batsman"" been unleashed finally after 12 years? Warnie?",7
Great camerawork lol,12
Superman,3
"You might think that that was a waste of a free hit but that's because you're playing 2D chess while Thala is playing 69D Underwater Sudoku.

Thala was just trying to get Sandeep injured all along.",1
Did we really need that staring from under the crotch shot?,6
Sandeep has bowled well today,2
Dhoni destroying SRH‚Äôs bowling by injuring them,11
Wow if caught that would have been some catch. Hope he is not seriously hurt.,6
Wow he was midair for a lot of time.,5
Sandeep > Batdeep,8
Cameraperson with some obscene angles.,6
Is it a good idea to have a Kashmir franchise? Thinking along the lines of cohesion and etc. Or is it a terrible idea?,8
Would‚Äôve been the catch of the tournament,11
"When dhoni bats, Bhuvi gone... now May be sandeep's time I think",8
Bowling to Dhoni is cursed for SRH bowlers,8
why did the cameraman find it necesssry to give us an ass shot,14
"Best fielding attempt

Easy!!!",5
I reckon he bent a rib there.,3
Almost the best catch of the monrh,11
"Every time csk and srh play, a goddamn injury lol",13
lose ball incoming,1
No more injuries please.,15
Sandeep has actually done pretty well with more responsibility.,20
"Is that bird.

No its just bowler with a broken back.",13

Sandeep marked for recruiting next season,4
The way they're batting 150 seems like a distant dream,1
"Sandeep was trying to get Dhoni out, while dhoni was worried about how others might play fast if he gets out.",9
Sandy's been so good today,3
Kya ‚ù§Ô∏èdu batting hai,2
"Sandeep heard Warner shouting from the boundary ""Drop it fam,we are winning"".",7
That's how you run between the wicket. Watson and Rayudu missed atleast 15 runs,6
Dhoni need to get out next ball to get my prediction of 14(11) right,2
Dhoni loves bowlers who moved back away from bat in his attack. Dhoni's weakness is also against the ball moving away.,1
Will this be dhoni‚Äôs final season?,1
"Welp if Sandeep is injured,  do SRH have a backup?",1
Well bowled sandy,1
"Come on Thala, do it for Star Sports",1
Great comeback spell by Sandeep today after being hit all over last game. Well done.,2
So when is Dhoni getting a bigger bat so he can run singles instead of dot balls?,0
What‚Äôs the average score on this ground?,1
Sandeep gave Rashid's figures for us today.,3
need 30 runs from 2 overs,0
Brilliant attempt. Much respect for Sandeep,3
Random fun fact: Piyush Chawla is 18 days younger than Ravindra Jadeja but runs like he is 18 years older than him.,5
"Mark Nicholas is losing my respect with every passing game. Man, unbearable cocksucking. 

He just described that it was partially good that Sandeep dropped the catch because we get to see more of Dhoni.",6
4 overs 2-19. Way beyond everyone‚Äôs expectations.,14
CSK gonna whack Khaleel for 20 runs,2
Sandy fly,1
"and that's how you convert 1s into 2s. cc: Rayudu, Watson.",1
Sandeep you surprised everyone today. Well played mate. Sometimes it feels good to be wrong.,3
"After the Curran start, anything less than 170 is disappointing imo. Our bowling lineup needs 170 to be able to defend.",-1
"I‚Äôm thrown off by these new PhonePe ads, I got used to the ‚Äòkaun shalu‚Äô one",2
Good bowling Sandy bhai!,1
Deeper. Deeper.,2
Can CSK get to 170?,5
warner looks so goofy with the stache,4
Nattu - why the wide-u??,2
This is not comforting to watch,1
Wtf. Last match these two teams had bhuvi got injured while bowling to dhoni at the end,6
Dhoni should play at 3 as an anchor. Otherwise he isn't useful to the team anymore.,1
165 at least please. Want an interesting match,8
One thing I am going to miss after Dhoni's retirement is Kohli-Dhoni running between the wickets.,46
Jaddu is timing this shit!,4
Tomorrow DC v RR. No no DC v Tewatia.,1
Put a fucking fielder there for this cunt,4
Smart move of giving Jadeja the strike,1
"Absolute blinder here by Dhoni, the pitch has died",2
Jadeja has mastered that shot,4
Sandeep was fucking horizontal in the air,4
"> Two overs left. CSK would want 160 at least if not 165.

Dinesh Kartik: ye me kar lets hu...",1
That's the third time he did that. Wtf is that field placing,4
Not Natarajan's day today,3
When will the mid league transfer  take place?,2
Jaddu playes that shot well,8
Jadeja been hitting the same shot for a boundary every ball now.,7
CSK is probably the only batting team in this tournament who look absolutely non threatening at the death lol,10
"Dhoni to Jadeja: ""there are 10+ balls. We'll take it deeper. Don't lose your wicket. Slow down""",10
My prediction is 164,7
Royal flush tomorrow,5
Jaddu playing the same shot over & over again,7
Even the neck beard dude has some fancy tats.,6
These cunts don‚Äôt even try to swing hard,6
Why is Natarajan having a neckbeard?,2
"This match can be summarised as ""When a  stoppable force meets a moveable object""",11
Low effort high output play by Jadeja,7
Where are the sixes????,3
161.,2
*Expecting Dhoni to hit a six in this over*,3
"That is a fucking sexy shot. It's poor bowling, but a lovely shot",1
Jaddu scoring boundaries with EA cricket 07 shot lol,3
Any thing below 160 should be good srh.,3
Its annoying to see batsmen don't try to hit when there are 6 more wickets in hand with only one over left.,8
"Prediction- CSK get 160-170, SRH lose by 20-30 runs",7
Can't wait for that godly 2 boundary montage at the end and the commentators going gaga over it,4
[deleted],2
Nattu to Jaddu,6
Jadeja only made this far in professional cricket due to above average fielding and thala's well wishes,2
Deepu telling them what shot to play.,1
Yeah Star sports. Show more of those Dhoni stats which mean jack shit now,2
Wide Yorkers give me lot of PTSD,2
Hit some sixes pls,1
Watson and Rayudu killed the game in the middle overs. Fuck this shit.,1
"Which is best cricket ad u have ever seen

For me its 2011 Switch hit pepsi ad with KP

Take tarbooja put inside

Alti palti de ghumake

i used to call it the palti shot n try every 2nd ball while playing that slogan in my mind",7
Genuine Q. How do the cams show such closeups of the players while I can't even see the cams myself?,1
CSK likes keeping wickets in the hut,2
Sandeep Sharma apology thread loading. r/Cricket memed him into figures of 2-19,5
Watson always looks sad or pissed off,3
Is Watto tearing up? ü•∫,1

"Nattu to Jaddu

Natarajan to Jadarajan

I was looking at Sandeep's stats and he's been quite consistent all these years. Never really had a bad season despite playing for 8 years. He gets overlooked but he usually gets the job done.,3
Chawla is 31 years old only in paperwork. He must be 37-38 years old,15

Full toss is the way to go...3 wickets today.,3
Thala is back,2
Pretty decent innings from Dhoni,4
This total is already imposing for SRH's brittle middle order. We might have a chance only if our opening partnership is atleast 130.,7
Yesss,1
at least he has a sr above 100 this time,3
Great intent thala. Better than tuk tuk shit. Pls don't go back,6
Best innings he's had this year?,3

Lollllllll literally two scoring shots in that knock. Thala still gonna blame the top and middle-order today?,-3
Pretty decent innings by Dhoni. Pretty nice strike rate. Prefer this to a 40 ball 50 run innings or something like that.,9
Is this how he maintains his 225 strike rate? Hits a 6 and gets out?,-3

Honestly dhoni should come in at 3. Only good thing he can do is run fast between the wickets with Faf,5
Send in Lord Shardul Thakur or we riot.,4
Finally bravo gets to bat and bowled first ball. Lmao,1
MSD has turned into Afridi but with extra steps.,7

Khaleel Redemption,2
Someone was asking to send Bravo in early. Sigh.,4
Bravo playing as specialist bowler,2
How do you not hit a length ball like that smh should've played Tahir,3

Hot Take- Tahir would add more value to CSK then Bravo,8
RIP Dheni,2

Yo wtf I was hyped for some Bravo slogging,5
Why did Jadeja cross? He should've kept strike.,3
Aao aur jaao,2
That's what happens when you just keep playing for nostalgia,3
Champion DUCK champion,4
Bravo needed to take a piss,3
160 doubtful,3
I dont know how khaleel manage to get wickets so often. Maybe his line and length is so wayward that he becomes unpredictable,2
Bravo Jao,2
Bravo to Tahir should look easy now for Fleming,1
Please cross the psychological barrier of 160 please CSK. Otherwise all the improvements will count for nothing.,5
Bravo is making CSK a 10 member squad,7
Khaleel has been SRH's best bowler today after Sandeep,8
Khaleel Ahmed promoted to Mitchell status after that wicket.,6
Poor camerawork,5
Why don't they show the animated duck like the australian broadcasters did?,8
I honestly don't even remember when was the last time dhoni played like dhoni against quality bowling attack,6
Well if bravo is just a pure bowler then why not play lungi or josh over him lol,9
"No point having Bravo at 8...no point taking this deep.. thakur,karn all can swing",7
Great stop captain,7
Imran Tahir died for this,7
Great finish this for SR,1
We are still one good batsman shot. Watson and Rayudu played an ODI innings. A better innings there would have comfortably taken us to 180+,3
Khaleel haters will say that was a pie,4
"**19.1** Ahmed to Bravo, OUT, **loses his stumps first ball.** **152-6**

Khaleel is like Mitch Starc from Wish.,13
Nice bit of fielding from Wavid,1
"The main players of csk are all retired, this is a tournament for young talents.",5
Dhoni's sixes are a beauty to behold. Even though we don't see much of it now,6
Khaleel ain't getting invitation to DJ Bravo's champion party.,2
Did Chahar not get 32(16) or something against SRH last time did he not?,6
I am happy to see this decline of bravo. Always seemed like a cunt specially to pollard. Whereas pollard is shining in blue and gold literally.,-5
[deleted],5
"Commentary has gotten a lot less descriptive. I wish they'd mention the length of the ball, the shot played, and to what area of the ground it went to.",3
Not sure if 21(13) is an innings worth recapping but you do you Star Sports,7
*lick *lick *lick what a six,2
*alriiiiight* Jadeja,1
There goes our redemption,2
"Guy hits one boundary

Commentators: why is he batting so low? Underutilized",5
Whose apology thread are we writing today? üòÅ,3
Honestly this is a good batting performance for CSK - I don't see them scoring 170+ unless one of them has a rare batting day.,8
One more 6 jaddu,6
"I am okay, at least I can say CSK tried to change team combination in order to win.",6
"Khaleel is so bad man, the way he manages to gets wickets seriously baffles me",3
Lord Thakur should've blessed the batting crease with his presence for the last five deliveries.,4
"Yeah bowl full toss in last over, khaleel you knob head",5
I doubt that SRH can chase 160+,5
A full toss? Really,5
The real discount starc is shardul. He's SThak,16
Khaleel u never learn do you?,6
Hate him as much as you want. That vintage six did give some good nostalgia.,32
Why the hell they keep bowling full toss.,11
Finally a full toss getting the right treatment,9
Bangar's making my ears bleed,4
"That was actually a good shot selection by MS. All he had to do was to get it over the fielder , would have gotten the four. Didn't come off.",1
"Bravo is an eyesore these days. Has to be hid in the field, has a jog and then floats the ball, and bats more like Walsh now than Pollard.",7
Jadeja is playing very nicely. Love seeing him bat.,7
Aise full toss kon deta hai death mein.,3
"Every time Warner takes time to talk to Khaleel, he bowls a shot fulltoss.",7
That's a beauty!!,4
Gg jaddu,5
Full toss to Jaddu. Nice,6
[removed],12
Time to open with Curran and Jadeja,2
"Khaleel fuck you, you idiot. Should we all now laugh at you for that?",4
"Khaleel just being khaleel, fucked up economy but gets wickets somehow",7
Khaleel is back,5
Jaddu low key been very good with the bat this season,10
Jaddu Beauty today,1
Jadeja gonna run through SRH tonight,2
We learn in school not to bowl full toss,6
"srh, no matter how much better they are than csk, are eternal cucks",4
[deleted],8
Jaddu rockets doesn't matter throwing them or hitting them,6
That went like a tracer bullet,3
Jaddu <3,5
Who said it‚Äôs was gonna be a 180 score lol,3
Chahar or shardul should‚Äôve been sent before Bravo,1
Great intent Show by CSK,3
Jadeja restoring CSK fans' hopes in style.,2
KHALEEL AHMED REDEMPTION,2
Is the pitch good for batting or have we fucked up the bowling?,3
Jadeja nice,4
Is Jadeja Dhoni's successor,3
They under utilise Jaddu,4
Laugh na khaleel!! üôÑ,5
That's why I never want to see Khaleel in the Indian team ever again.,8
Jadeja and Dhoni need to bat one position higher up. Give this man more balls to bat ffs,1
And somehow khaleel is still cocky af,3
Jaddu is imposter in Csk,5
Jadeja's played some decent cameos this year,4
MaStErClAsS fRoM dHoNi,5
Always said it CSK UNDER UTILISES JADDU,4
Get SRH‚Äôs top 3 and they‚Äôre gone... that‚Äôs been quite the trend this season actually,1
Had it been MI KHALEEL would have gone for 60 Tonight,2
"if theres seam movement, bhenchod bravo wont do shit and hazlewood would be thinking about how he would run through SRH",1
Whats with this stupid hate for dhoni. I mean people here hate him for breathing. He did his job and got out trying to hit some more what else do you all want.,31
One six would make it better 170 would be psychological advantage,4
"Jadeja>>>Dhoni

As of now",12
"Does anybody know when did full length became the slot?

I think it is first time I am seeing this terminology",2
Jadeja has shown enough INTENT^TM in all matches but he's gone unnoticed because of Curran's INTENT^TM output.,15
Jadeja should open.,6
Why so much discussions for last ball FFS,2
I am probably going overboard but Dhoni's sixes have an essence to them its just beautiful to watch.,16
Haven't had this much hope from a CSK innings this season,3
Why Jadeja was promoted,0
Par score. Could have scored 180+ but that would be asking too much from CSK,0
Jadeja scared that Tawatia might replace him /s,8
Khaleel has 27 wickets for SRH in 16 matches with an average of 19.77 and economy of 9.,8
Jadeja is unironically the best batsman in CSK,21
See. Jaddu could have started hitting in 19th over don't know why he was just focusing on guiding the ball.,5
Crossed 160. Would've got another 20 if Rayudu and Watson rotated the strike better. Still this looks like a decent score to defend.,9
"""J'jeja""",2
Khaleel went from the worst bowler to the best bowler to the worst bowler in no time on this thread.,7
Khaleak back to form,4
Khaleel getting smacked. Normalcy has returned,9
Hopefully Bairstow sees off Chahar.,-1
Umpire doing the funk,1
Kya baigan ka bowling daalra re bhai,5
"People look at the bat after they get out, Jadeja looks at it after hitting a six",7
Jadeja playing pinball with that shot,2
"Jaddu playing too fast here, going against CSK plans",3
Anyone getting dismissed to Khaleel should be embarrassed,18
"Khaleel is a wicket taking bowler, economy doesn‚Äôt matter to him, you need to have 500 IQ to understand his wicket taking tactics",12
How on earth was that wide??????,4
I'll take that.,3
Stupid number of full tosses in the last few overs (yes i know some were wickets but still...),4
[Close call](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/jac33w/-/g8p5gci),5
Ez CSK win,1
That doubled the speed of the shot,2
"Lol, did umpire yeet the ball with his leg",2
Defendable total at least,8
"Mark Nicholas is a fucking idiot

He said ""Chahar knew Jadeja had to face the final ball"" after they ran 2

That was the final ball you knob",16
"Some of the bowling is utter village. Lads, let's bowl a full toss. And another.",8
Kya hua khaleel? Where's that smirk now boy?ü§®,7
[deleted],30
Dont you think the viewers need mini map of the field to see the field positions like in cricket games and tracking of the ball for where it goes??,18
Sanju manju > Mark Nicholas don't @ me,2
Ootl what's the sir in Sir Jadeja mean?,1
No hope SRH can chase this. Whom are we playing next?,6
why does khaleel have a smile on his face w an 11 economy,10
Fairplay,2
167 is a good score.,7
[removed],-11
Jaddu has turned it around a bit eh. Finishing well lately,9
Does anyone else think Ahmed looks like brown Robin Williams?,3
CSK is a retirement home and Faf and Jadeja are the stupidly sexy caretakers,23
Does that dock points from the fair play table? Running of a deflection from the batsmen?,5
Better running between the wickets in middle overs and they would have easily reached 175.,4
Solid total considering the pitch,2
Srrreeni mama fuck off,4
Well lads... I still had hope after the toss. Not gonna watch the collapse and losing by 30 odd runs.,5
Lol the commentator,4
sandeep‚Äôs economy hot damn,7
Jadeja gonna get dropped next match for playing with a strike rate of 250,6
"This is definitely a good total to defend. CSK is back into the game, they need to get their fielding setup right.",8
Decent Score,5
[deleted],6
Why does it feel like Khaleel bowled an amazing spell even though his figures are 2-45 in 4,10
Khaleel should be considered as batsman for the opposite team,18
[deleted],30
Lmao 160 is like 200 for us,19
Should be a winning score,4
"Please promote Jadeja 

Can counter leg spin  
Take quick runs and rotate the strike in the middle overs

They desperately need that",1
Match gone,4
"After years of no Rajasthani player at the highest level, it is so heartening to see two Rajasthan pacers Deepak and Khaleel leading two IPL attacks. Finally we found some local heroes. Rahul Chahar too.",9
"Lol, Did the umpire gave it a nice punt XD?",2
Could've been easy 180+ for any other team with this sort of death bowling,5
Not as dominant as they were in past but a much better show by CSK today. Dhoni just like the last match seem to realise that he can't take it deep in past so he is hitting earlier. And obligatory 'cute' shots by Jadeja. Sending Curran to top seems to have worked out too.,8
"167. We got a game on guys. Decent performance by team. Only if we improve our mid overs batting, we are good for 175+ everytime.",7
What's with the dugout music?,2
Last 5 overs = 50 runs. Not bad,10
With CSK bowling we should win it but we are a weird squad.,5
10 less because of Watson and Rayudu inability to run,24
Why does Thakur bat at #10? I thought a couple years ago he won a few games for CSK with some big hitting at the end.,6
[deleted],12
168 to win. CSK wins my prediction.,1
At least there was Intent today in CSK batting. Everyone kept their SR higher than 100,5
"Jadeja and Sam curran collectively

56 of 31

Just goes to prove left is right in t20",43
hope our openers play well today send kanos next not pandey,0
"considering faf ducked out, i‚Äôm happy w this score",12
"Keep Curran at the top imo, he played very well. Move watto up and Faf one down",36
"‚ÄòWith MSD on the crease, CSK would‚Äôve thought they‚Äôd have got 175 or 180‚Äô Holy shit Gavaskar there‚Äôs a limit to sucking Dhoni‚Äôs dick",5
Good score but still not out of reach for srh.,1
Why TF is Bairstow angry about a ricochet off the batsman? He won a World Cup that way!üòÅ,75
This is a great opportunity for manish pandey to score runs in his preferred fashion,8
Severus Snape is a bit in comm box....ngl,4
"CSK batting was actually good to watch for once, they did show more intent today and they have a good total on the board.

If Warner, Bairstow or Kane does not score big, CSK should defend this comfortably.",24
Chaseable but it all depends on top order obviously,9
"Jadeja and Dhoni saved this innings for CSK. We're once again way too slow in the middle overs, same reason why we lost the KKR match.",17
hope piyush sharma doesn't fuck this up.,4
It's going to be very very tricky for SRH to chase.,2
All I want is a deepak chahar inswinger to go through the Yorkshire gate,15
Srh fans jinxing a,0
"This is a game where Pandey‚Äôs 120-130 strike rates is completely acceptable. It‚Äôs not a mammoth score but one batsman needs to bat through. If Pandey makes us lose again, then there‚Äôs no other explanation than he‚Äôs just a bad player.",11
Delicately poised cement derby at halfway,13
17 full tosses this innings.,5
Easy chase for SRH as long as Warner and Bairstow are playing.,4
Petition to provide rollerblades to senior citizens Watson and Rayudu for helping them run 1s and 2s.,29
Say what you will about Jaddu but he rotates strike better than anyone else in CSK. This bowling attack was very ordinary and we should have gotten 180 minimum. But CSK have been so poor this season this target makes us happy,17
Replacement for Ishant in Border Gavaskar? My choice is Siraj,2
Top cameo from Jadeja. Chasable total but SRH batting is pretty thin. But I‚Äôm backing them to chase this considering that Manish and Williamson will know how to pace their innings.,11
"Given that Bravo's batting has pretty much fallen off a cliff, we might be better served playing an overseas bowler and giving the younger batsmen a go.",9
Decent total. SRH isn‚Äôt thattt batting heavy once top order is gone. should be a good chase perhaps,1
"First baller to Khaleel Ahmed...Yeesh, that's a new low for Bravo. I feel for the guy must feel like shit now.",10
Jaddu has never played bad in this season.,15
"On one hand, I hate it when the commentators and the fans online jerk off about the helicopter every chance they get. But on the other hand, that helicopter shot was something so beautiful to look back. Powerful, vintage stuff.

I'm so torn.",15
I feel like either it would already be over for srh by the end of powerplay or they'll easily win around the 19th over,7
waiting for sir jadeja to rock with the ball,3
Faf 77(33) incoming after that golden duck?,12
We scored 164 here last time against CSK and defended it.,6
Star sports praising Dhoni inning ahead of Jadeja lol,15
"Advantage SRH, but Should be a tight game.Csk do have 7 bowlers today lol",-1
"Csk needed this and needed it badly, they face dc next",3
"The way watson n rayudu were running

I dont think they will be able to take any singles in Sharjah",4
Where was Bairstow angry? I didn't see him do anything,1
"KP: All you need is a player to score 70 and the match is win. Why 70? How about 100, 150, 170",0
Jadeja needs to put more air and bowl slower to do good here imo,1
"Dhoni is a top guy the broadcast makes it their personal goal to make us hate him, talk about Curran, talk about how CSK did a good job. No show Dhoni highlights they legit showed a single in the montageüò≠",15
Csk is losing at least 20 runs by not taking singles and converting doubles to singles.,18
"Everywhere I go, 
I see you ***Intent***",14
The way Chahar swings it back into the right handers. It's going to be interesting watching him vs YJB.,5

"This is an average score. Last game we failed to defend an average score. If we fail to both chase and defend scores against teams that are in the lower half of the table, then yes we deserve to be in the lower half of the table.",16
Jaddu with 250 strike rate with those late cuts and a six. unreal.,7
Open with curran and jadeja. Watto 1 down faf 2 down. Tahir in for bravo.,4
Dhoni did well with the bat today. No criticism today‚ù§Ô∏è,14
They need some youngster in middle overs. Both Rayudu and Watson can't play together.,4
"Just did my part to vote Trump out of office. Thank me later, rest of world",30
K P and Neroli Meadows ‚úåüèΩüëåüèΩüëçüèΩ,6
CSK got the batting order almost correct this time. Need to move Watto to opening and Faf at 3. Faf can be aggressive in the middle order but Watto needs time to build an innings.,8
"Will we see Jonny Bairstow, or Jonny CleanBowledInTheFirstOverstow",20
That 20+ run over from khaleel in the powerplay and his full tosses made the game really difficult for us,5
"Chahar's powerplay bowling will dictate the course of the game. If he gets warner and Bairstow, it's game over for SRH",3
Rayudu actually batted at 4 this match. Lol,11
"If Bairstow survives pace he gonna murder those 2 CSK leggies here, his record against leg spinner is impeccable",6
Worried Bairstow is gonna get clean bowled by a Chahar inswinger again,12
"I'll miss the first hour of the chase, so if anyone wants to do something for me, please take shots at David Warner's moustache. Hideous",5
"Damn, would be hilarious if Bairstow scores less than Curran at the top",11
Watto hit three six . Yet only got hundred strike rate .,2
"I think the Curran experiment should continue. I think more then anything, he keeps the run rate going while the openers are playing themselves in",19
Wasn't prepared for a universe where CSK is the underdog in most match ups.,22
MI fears that if CSK back to form they can't defend their title.,6
Warner's stache is hideous! (helping a redditor out),2
All üëç I need üòä is a Kanos üòç masterclass üò© to shut up ‚úåüèªthese üíÅüèª Thala fanboisüòòüòòüòéüòé,-29
Bairstow's wicket gonna be key here IMO,8
"Boundary hitting in this innings was on point. If running between wickets was better during Watson-Rayudu partnership, they could have got 175 and that would be hard to chase on this pitch.

Even with 167, CSK are favorites unless one of SRH‚Äôs overseas big 3 score big.",16
They'll chase it down in 18 overs with 6 wickets to spare I reckon,7
No way SRH are chasing this with future CSK captain Shardul Thakur in the form of his life.,24
"Surprisingly Csk finished really well today

Even dhoni with 21 of 13 did his job

If only rayudu n watto had been more agressive

Still a decent target

Get 1 in pp n csk in the game",11
SRH fans bitchinf about their middle order but it is that middle order that won them their last game against CSK.,13
"Predictions on when YJB will get bowled through the gate by Chahar?

My money's on 4 balls in",6
"I wake up at night thinking about some rando on r/cricket suggesting Kanos to be the future CSK captain.   
So controversial, yet so true.",16
Warner + Bairstow opening is so OP. Its almost like one of them is guaranteed to go on to do some damage,9
[deleted],15
Let's accept that dhoni and jadeja played well today. Only problem was the dots and tuk tuk going on between Watson and rayudu but overall a much improved performance and good decision having so many bowlers,10
Pandey for 11 crores is overpriced. He's not a match winner in t20. Even Manoj Tiwary can play the same role who was available for base price.,16
Do you think IPL finals should be a 3 match series,-6
Calling it now. Bairstow is Chahar's bunny.,9
"The opening partnership is key. Rattle both of them in the powerplay, and CSK shouldn't have too hard time. The bowlers want to restrict those two as much as possible because when they get going, they're gone.",3

Rayudu would've thrown that ball at the wickets but he got scared by Warner's sex offender mustache.,9
"If Bairstow destroys leggies and is weak against inswingers, why not send him lower down when the ball ain't swinging/leggies come in ?

Same argument would stand for Finch as well.",9
I am supporting Csk because it wil help RR but I am pretty sure I will change side moment Kanos come to bat.,3
Is this thread ded?,2
Did he just use his sweat to shine the ball,3
CSK should buy Kane if they want to really look towards the future. SRH fans will bully me but ya'll ain't got no respect for Cricket Jesus. Why tf would you even utter nonsense like replacing him with Nabi?,14

YJB obviously the bigger player",4
"CSK batting lineup looks so much better without Jadhav in it.

I'm mentally prepared for next season. Anyone else?,9
gavaskar again with 90s wisdom,6
Rayudu is tired after chasing the ball?,5
Rayudu already requires glucose drips,1

Obligatory daily comment: Losing team fans are downvoting coz they are triggered by my comments,9
Upvoted last 100 comments ..,7
Nepotism in cricket is the worst kind of nepotism,6
Bravo is the highest wicket taker in all of T20. He is The purple cap holder of the entire fucking format. Respect the bowler.,9
Blessing in disguise Pandey's wicket??,6
Kane is the most complete batsman out of the Fab 4. I don‚Äôt care about stats. I am a grown man and still struggle with the idea of having his life size portrait in my room.,9
"Just a reminder that peak Warner in 2016 was dismissed in the Powerplay by Ashok Dinda for a 4-ball duck. This was a season he went on to make 800+ runs for SRH and win the title. Although, it was Dinda's best season with the ball too. In a season where most Indian pacers except Bhuvi struggled, Dinda went unnoticed getting around 16 wickets and bowling Yorkers at the death.",7

Almost every match Sam Curran gives undroppable performances,10

This match is done",4
To counter the serial down voters we need to be serial upvoters,3
This running between the wickets is something that CSK fans can only dream of.,5
"Lol 10 minutes ago why are the commentators only talking about Rashid.


 And for the last 10 minutes, let's all just talk about the downvoters :p",4
I think Warner should seriously consider dropping/resting himself lol,6
I feel like mark nicholas frequently uses phone sex hotlines,8
Rarely we see Gavaskar and gavaskar lite commentating together and disagreeing,5

Mods should implement hidden scores for 15 minutes to discourage downvoters,12
Csk played 35 dot balls in the 1st 13... nearly 6 overs...that's why the score wasn't high then despite a boundary every over,8
Boat ads with some cool drip.,6
That ball would've bowled Bairstow,1

Uncles team is so kind to let English boy open the batting and Bowling. Best uncles ever!,7
"if we can keep him, curran will be the future face of csk",8
I feel sad that it's just because of Marsh's injury that Kanos got into the team when he should be a automatic entry in the 11 in any team. SRH needs to buy better Indian fast bowlers,4

Vijayshankar‚Äôs selection in the Indian team has turned into a meme. He didn‚Äôt call himself a 3D player.,8
Bowling chahar out. Wise! But Chahar needs to be good in slog overs for India,4
Good to see 4 overs on the trot,6
Dhoni wants to really finish Chahar's overs early,3
Unpopular Opinion: That Altroz car doesn't look half bad.,10
Spinners still haven't come into play and it's the seventh over. Interesting.,1
I'd pay good money to watch Chawla do yo yo test,5
Has there been any match where the first two bowlers have bowled out in the first 8?,7
Chahar bowling out straight away actually not a bad choice,9
"Whoa chahar straight 4, MS backing thakur and dj to do the job at the end.",8
"An Altroz ad without Swanny feels empty , I'm getting mad sitting at home",11
At least we don't have the excuse of Pandey killing our chase today.,10
Dugout boring without swaney today,9

India has a bucket load of young, talented batsmen coming through the ranks too. That has to be playing on his mind.

Being a pro cricketer sounds hellish at times. Imagine being in early thirties and people start wondering about your retirement.",8
Leg Umpire showing his inner spidey,2
Unpopular opinion: Altroz > Bugatti Chiron,34
"Dhoni still has shardul, bravo, Jadeja, Karn and chawla",5
Respect to Pandey for getting out before he faces 15 balls,7
"No dots, feels so good",3
This is Williamsons chance to play a blinder.,7
Bangar would be good if he didn‚Äôt have the charisma of a doorknob,15
SRH win by 7 wickets,9
"Jonny had enough of this shit, calm down big head. We have to win this.",5
"Harsha Bhogle: What a difference one move makes! Curran provides the start, everyone else can play at their pace, get wickets in hand and a comfortable score to bowl at. Curran broke the lethargy.",5
"Williamson is the actually the dream player Csk would dream to fill Dhoni's shoes.Cool ,calm ,composed ,good tactician, finds the gaps, can change gears....even strikes a few blows coming at death

Bonus:No one hates him....Would sync perfectly with Dhoni, Flemming..... SRH won't let him go",48
"Why do people here shit on Bangar. For noobs like me, he provides valuable insights like these.",9
Chahar gone all in to get bairstow,2
Jony jony. Yes papa. Isn‚Äôt that like an Indian joke,6
Chahar is a good death bowler as well. Should have retained at least 1 owner for later. Curran and Thakur's quota should be completed by 15th over mark.,3
"I remember being in college during the world cup semis and everyone was celebrating when we took down India's top order on a day we didn't expect to win. Imagine our heartbreak on the final day. I wanna see Csk win but Kanos is my weakness, I want to see him get a really good score ü•∫",8
Nadal would be proud of that Johnny,7
"They're effortlessly taking twos

Chaahrgrath not getting wickets is so weird.,4
Inb4 last 10 overs are bowled entirely by spin,4
"When Swann had just started playing county cricket, he used to sleep in his Altroz before he got a contract.",12
Man I wish Joe root played ipl,10
Srh just keep Kanos to fuck up with other teams.,3
Sweeps- InNoVaTiVe,4
I know the pitch is slow but if CSK have to huff and puff to reach 160ish that is very sad for their batting,3
"YJB and Kanos have such different approaches to their batting, yet they're so great to watch in their own ways",7
"I have never learn things like this in any cricket broadcast.

Dugout is really special.",7
root should play ipl no way he isn't better than kane,4
Dhoni has a weird shit catching technique. It is what we called a crocodile mouth. My coach would kill me if I did that. And here he is playing 300+ ODIs as a WK...,11
I wish to someday have the confidence of a guy posting a selfi of himself on hotstar chat box,9
this game entirely depends on how soon yjb top edges a slog,8
CSK has 5 more bowlers.,2
Swann's first time was at the rear of a gold altroz.,7
Chahar has got a very repeatable action and he's always adding some variation each season a thinking bowler very refreshing after watching khaleak bowl...,5
Santner not playing this year or not picked yet?,3
Which side is agent Thakur playing for today,9
Why jaddu?,2
Don't know what to make of Chahar's spell today. Didn't take wickets which is his first job but didn't get hit for runs either. Why Doesn't Dhoni try him at death more?,4
Dhoni and Rayudu after scoring above 100 S/R: Are we the baddies,7
csk winning this no? I don't mind it's good for rcb,1
Looks like someone adds a comma after each word in Bangar‚Äôs script.,15
I call Shankar winning the match today,6
"No Pandey 50, no guaranteed loss. I'm all about the positives right now.",4
"SRH fans don't forget, Vijay Babu is yet to come.",1
Lol Balaji what was that face?,4

Edit: of course YJB goes for the reverse sweep after I post this, great",7
Looked like it went straight.. why is he not referring?,2
Good running between wickets,2
Holyyyy shit bairstow has been missing his shots,4
MS with that special Indian appeal very nice,11
That umpire looks like a mob boss in a Bollywood movie,6
Im sorry but shane Watson is too much of a liability in the field In 2020. This is totally against the Dhoni 2012 policy,6
Lol Dhoni why scream like a fox then not review,10
Umpire looks away to avoid eye contact with MSD,11
Mike Hussey should have been playing in CSK he is not too old for them,13
I love it when players appeal and umpire casually sets the ball count with a poker face.,9
Isn't that the best ump India has to offer?,1
"Johnny before playing a shot :- dafuq ima doin here hitting a ball with stick 





After hitting (post nut clarity) üí∞üí∞üí∞ money bissh run fuck",7
Weekly reminder that Kohli is older than Piyush Chawla.,8
My pajama sense says that Bairsteed will score 50 today and Shankar will hit the winning runs,2
The review process really highlights the real shouts from the fake. I like how they yell in unison and then appear totally disinterested for the DRS timer.,8
Are rabada and nortje the best three format bowling partnership? I‚Äôd say starc hazlewood is better but i can‚Äôt think of any more; sorry but shami is quite exxxxxxxxpensive in T20s,0
Anyone else really like hearing the players?,6
"Curran is already a very canny operator, couple of seasons under MS and Flemming and he's going to be a crusher of dreams on the international circuit.",1
"As a Chennai fan , I am very paranoid of this slow partnership . Kane/bairstow duo aren‚Äôt scoring too fast but they aren‚Äôt struggling either !",13
[deleted],8
lol they ain't bowling leggies against Bairstow,3
"Playing less dot balls is the key here.

So far so good for yjb and willamson.",4
Jesus watto can hardly move in the field,2
[deleted],3
Lmao Chawla swimming,3
LORD!,1
Remember Balaji‚Äôs sixes,2
damn that Chacha Chawla dive,2
Chawla diving around ? What universe am I in ?,11
thicc boy with the save,6
Considering that CSK can get replacement's Alex Hales could be a terrific choice for them. Thoughts?,6
Elegance from Chawla,9
Braistow has played enough,0
I've seen Shardul get Kanos out with gift of deliveries. He does have a knack of getting out to rubbish balls.,4
CSK were at 61-2 we ar at 53&2 they have long tail as well. We are playing too slowly,12
Chawla swimming in hyd roads rn XD,10
Obligatory mention that chawla is younger than Koach,29
Dhoni lowkey looks like Sardar Khan,17
Piyush Chawla is grossly unfit. its unfortunate these players dont work on fitness despite being paid so much to play cricket.,27
Genuine Q. Who's the chawla people are talking about?,7
Lord shardhul get us a wicket,6
Drs had a spring assist there..no away that bounced that much,3
SRH haven't been hitting boundaries but both batsmen have 100+ SR. During CSK innings Watson and Rayudu had to hit big sixes just to catch up to their dot balls.,7
I've seen kohli and Chawla's ages a thousand times yet I still refuse to believe it every time,5
Oh yeah only about a mile too high on that lbw shout lmao,4
Williamson showing takoor the respect he deserves,10
"I want boundary need dopamine
Or a really good wicket... But thakur is bowling so Boundary",1
We need a wicket now. Butt clenching is happening again.,3
Fucking Swiggy wants to charge 50% of the food price as delivery charge. Probably to find those ads between the matches.,13
"maybe it‚Äôs just srh‚Äôs cuckery, but csk looks much better batting first than trying to chase every time",11
Can stokes turn it around for rr? Should he open?,4
Ye haath humko Dede Thakur.........,3
"Dhoni doesn't review an obvious decision.

Star sports : Dhoni is a god among mortals",26
‚ÄúTAKING IT DEEP‚Äù,6
"If I was a girl , I would ve let Watson fuck me ! I think its the best compliment a straight guy can give to another",11
Mithaiwala is sus.,6
I was gonna say that Chawla was injured and then I realised it was Mishra. All these thiccc leggies look the same to me apparently,13
Chawla playing as specialist fielder today,7
Chawla is the same age as Kohli just saying.,4
dhoni is whispering in their ears to take it deep,14
"taking it deep, I N T E N T, what other iconic phrases do cricket commentators say?",16
**People who say CSK play Test what is SRH doing? Be equal if you wanna criticise**,19
No over from Karn or Chawla yet . Could have just played Jagadeeshan instead,10
wtf is this batting?,9
Yes. I was wondering when commentators start sucking off Dhoni for Dhoni Review System. Here you are.,10
A partnership is building. Someone break this already! Preferably Kanos!,3
How are we going to win from here. We don't even have someone like Tewatia,12
CSK shouldn't have taken Pandey's wicket. This combo is extremely dangerous towards the end.,14
SRH can play out 5 maiden overs and still win it.,8
"Good umpiring üôÖ

Dhoni god üëàüëà",14
"Next over for Thakur gonna go for 15 runs, lord taketh lord giveth",5
(Taking it Deep)‚Ñ¢,10
Why so many ads today in select dugout,5
SRH should win if Bairstow stays till the end. if CSK could take out these 2 they will win.,6
"CSK will have to construct a team out of the leftovers of every side. I think we will have a terrible phase for the next 7-8 years as we collect a new core. It took DC like a decade to gather this current squad, we will need to do the same",5
Will we ever have a Strategic Time Out in Test Cricket?,6
"Lenskart advertisement is such an ass, every time it comes I think it‚Äôs live",9
"Side question: the fuck is this Kamala Pasand ad supposed to be.

Edit: I know it's pan masala. I'm asking how is it winning cricket matches.",12
jesus that bravo runout is a beauty,4
CSK should go for Malan in auction,6
"Somewhere between Dhoni and Kohli, Chawla also got old on fringes. He was our u19 captain before Kohli. Sad to see him struggling to keep up.",8
"Baby you are my CVV

I'm your OTP

Download Cred baby

Best way to flirt ngl",11
Poor shankar will get blamed that he can't score 60 runs in 4 over if they keep going like this.,17
[deleted],1
No way csk is losing this . Srh lower middle order looks the least threatening in this ipl.,3
"Chawla is not actually 31 
Gotta be 35 easily, don't we all know until recently every young Indian/asian crickter unless he/she was top notch lied about their age. Don't know about SENA countries. And he's got the babiest of baby faces.",5
"After 9 overs 


Csk 64/2


Srh 57/2",3
"Chawla is younger than Kohli. Also, Chawla made his debut for the Indian test team before Kohli made his first class debut.",13
movable force vs stoppable object,12
Man CSK cannot afford to lose.,1
How are they getting singles do easily?,1
Lots of meme potential from Warner there,6
"Because we're playing against CSK, we're playing for NRR.",8
Imagine it was Pandey playing an innings like this,5
"ngl, barristow looking very shaky with failed unorthodox shots",5
Do you guys think saini and chahar would be just as good as bhuvi and bumrah one day??,8
RR is above 10 boys. *inhales*,2
Srh running is fantastic. Difference between the 2 teams running between the wickets is easily 10-15 runs,2
SRH have looked much better than CSK for most of the first half of this IPL but if they lose this they are gonna have the same no of points as CSK,6
Can  3D Tonk it ?,3
Jaddu looks like that yes guy,1
How much money do you think Ambani offers to Kohli outside the option to play for MI?,2
Stop whining everyone both of them are playing fine considering thin batting lineup.,6
Jaddu bowling nice line tonight,8
Is chawla a dedicated fielder today?,5
Game‚Äôs over,2
"MS holding out leg spinners is smart move ....

Edit : there it is .....",7
That cleaned him up,3
Baristow was struggling for the last few balls. This was coming!,4
That‚Äôs the game ?,2
[deleted],7
"You miss, I hit delivery",3
This bowled is better than any six,8
There it is,4
Rip SRH,6
Csk fans be like - is it 2010?,8
Fuck this shit,1
saw it coming from miles away,6
"Woah, Johnny was struggling",3
Classic Jaddu!,2
"Jadeja whatta a ball son, wowza",2
wow graeme swann‚Äôs theory proved to be true yet again,4
[deleted],2
Who else saw this coming?,7
We missed you Jaddu <3,4
1 wicket away before tail begins.,2
"Loving the IPL, but I just can't wait for international cricket to start! Can't wait to use the team India flair.",6
Aaaaaand that's the match,3
Very Watsonesque innings from Bairstow,3
Bairstow gone. Kane needs to stay till the end. Target is also getting hard.,5
Bairstow and getting bowled. Name a more iconic duo.,4
haha. Partnership broken!! Asked and delivered!,4
Looks like it‚Äôs over.,5
"Spin on, Bairstow gone.",6
"We're the only team in the tournament where
Either both the batsmen are enforcers or both are anchors. There's no middle ground.",5
Who's the new guy who ran up to Jaddu and hi-fived him? Looks like DDP sibling.,3
Jafuckingdeja,3
Jaddu is a fucking superstar. Right up there with Rohit and Virat for India.,2
"If there is a mega auction next year, who should CSK retain and RTM?",3
That's it. Was never gonna be an easy chase but losing Warner early and Bairstow getting bogged down and out has sealed it,4
3D o'clock,5
Bairstow desperate to get back into the red ball side for England,4
Whoa.. sexy bowling,8
"Priyam garg might be a match winner here, looks very correct",4
Samad and Abhishek > Shankar and Nadeem,3
"Now Garg, play like you did in the last game against CSK",4
Is Bairstiw generally weak/average against spin?,3
game over for srh,3
Play for NRR boys,5
Thala Bairstow,8
We are done unless Kane comes up with something extraordinary,4
Why the fk is it so hard to chase nowadays???,2
"These two are running great between the wickets. 

But seriously why is there absolutely no criticism for the way they are batting ???",3
"**9.5** Jadeja to Bairstow, OUT, **hits middle stump!** Classic stuff from Jadeja. Cramps him, ties him, induces the false shot. Good length and tight on the stumps again. Bairstow looks to whip into the leg side and is beaten on the inside edge **59-3**

JM Bairstow  b Jadeja 23 (24b 2x4 0x6) SR: 95.83",3
Ooh Tahir chacha üòç,3
If T20 WC moves to UAE then Jadeja easily gets that second spinner spot,3
"Are SRH's no. 5,6,7 batsmen better than RCB's no. 5,6,7 ?",2
Bat first and win the game seems like a hard and fast rule this season,4
Bairstow through the gates. Classic.,3
We will win this match. Hope we win all the matches and IPL 2020 final and become champions üíõüíõ,4
"Are they not hitting because they can't or are they biding their time?

Edit : I'm so  sorry for jinx.... :(",4
Watching Tahir be the water boy is sad to see. He was the purple cap winner last season,4
Kinda strange to see us not being on the receiving end of a choke,4
Garg PTSD intensifies,5
Garg and Williamson?? Run out coming up,10
"That was, of course, inevitable after I picked Warner as my captain. And this is why I am not a selector as I picked:

Faf (Vc)

Warner (C)

Rashid

Natarajan

Bairstow

Hopefully Bravo and Jadeja can redeem my selections...",5
If Priyam wins this for us I'll name my second born Priyam,7
Man it's hard to see Imran Tahir this way,6
"Second half of this tournament is tailor made for Dhoni.
Pitches are getting slower, I wont be surprised if he plays 4 spinners soon. 

I don't see CSK losing anything while defending",9
"Build a partnership 

Gets out when it's time to strike.

How the hell you will win",2
Jadeja offers so much in all three disciplines of the game,8
Hate the way Warner and Bairstow are playing some games where they don't take any risk at all in powerplays and then they get out anyway due to a bad shot or something,3
"3D - no bowling, no (extraordinary) fielding, not sent to bat üòí",5
"Jadeja needs to be selected for T20 WC. Most of his performances look average, but he seems to have that big match winning impact at crucial stages. What do u guys think?",7
India's world cup no. 4 batting so much down the order ?,10
Sad to see Tahir hauling drinks like that. The man needs to get a match,15
This is now a teenagers vs dads contest.,8
Garg will run williamson out soon!,3
Choke by spin is vintage CSK,9
What's wrong with opening with your best batsmen rather than pretend to be strengthening your middle order when your best batsmen face barely 10ish deliveries? Ex: Stokes at RR this year. Makes sense for him to open ain't it?,4
Jadeja  has been the MVP today,4
Garg don‚Äôt u dare to hurt my willy,5
"Rooting for CSK as a King XI fan cause it makes that 4th seed even more wide open.

P.S. Yeah I know chances are slim for us lol",7
"If a run out doesn't happen, I'll be disappointed..",3
"Dhoni be like : You tryna choke us with spin in the middle overs all the time.
Bitch I invented that!",25
25 balls since last boundary,3
"Win the toss, win the game unless u have tewatia",9
"Jaddu has always needed someone to bowl in tandem with him who turned it other way, be it Ashwin, Kuldeep or even Tahir with his googlys. Great to see him coming into his own finally.",5
Sad that we don't have a tewatia. Only lord can shine in chases this season,10
The mutual fund consortium is really desperate,3
"If you met Karn Sharma in the grocery store, would you think he is a million dollar international athlete",12
Is Tahir selling bhel out there?,13
Lord Karn Sharma,3
Cmon Garg,3
Chepauk choke‚Ñ¢ is on boys!,7
Karn Sharma is thicc,6
3D from world cup to IPL passenger,7
"100 to get and four more bravo overs.. Yeah this one might be done
Good net for kanos and pag tho",3
Orange man sus? ü§î,5
Jadeja is the true x-factor for CSK,7
"10 overs 


Csk 69/2


Srh 60/3",4
"We can't make 32 off 18, in no world can we make 108 in 60.",3
Hoping that garg pulls off a blinder,2
Somewhere in tier 2 cities of india kids are going to sleep dreaming of being the Dream XI game changer of the match some day,6
The only way csk can end the season of a respectable place is if the pitches start turning square...,3
"What should be a 3 year plan for CSK Management?
Big task of smoothly transitioning these players out and bringing in new talent. 
Plus fans are fickle, they won‚Äôt tolerate failures for more than an year.",5
"Gonna be a huge ask for Kane to get us through here, CSK clear favorites",4
Fun fact Karn Sharma is also managed by Dhonis sports agency Rhiti Sports or something,3
Garg ranout Kanos. But Kanos doesn't want to run him out.,2
CSK to comeback in the second half of the tournament with the pitches becoming slower like Chepauk?,9
"No matter what people say, Kane will always feel at home in SRH. Rosco in NZ and Garg in SRH. Run out partner Nostalgia.",7
Once upon a time in Chepauk..... getting the old vibes,6
CSK looks like a different team when defending!,7
"That ""Oh yeah!"" from MS is right in the feelz :')",19
Looks like we've given up and are playing for NetRunRate‚Ñ¢,1
"Chasing is hard this IPL, whenever CSK lost when chasing people blindly said it's because they're old instead of seeing that",3
"Sayee Narayanaa: ""Sam Curran looks like a perfect replacement of Albie Morkel for CSK! Feels like he will be with them for years to come!""

- cricbuzz


Please dont do that to him",6
I give up this is SRH batting you think we're a team that can take it deep and start hitting hard ?lmao,5
Does any team except MI even have a stable middle order?,4
Karn ‚Äúcan I talk to your manager‚Äù Sharma,10
"This year finger spinners are doing lot better than leggies, be it Jadeja, Ashwin, Sundar, Axar, etc",2
That SRH dugout looks as gloomy as a hob goblin now.,1
"Slowing pitch is not the reason for winning...CSK batted second always if not most of the time. 
And SRH doesn‚Äôt win on chasing. 
Stats don‚Äôt lie.",7
Bairstow is not struggling with form but it looks like he doesn't have skills to perform in pressure situation or against spinners.,5
"No offense but Karn Sharma looks like the face of most of the  characters from ES : Oblivion, lol",11
Karn Sharma is the prime example of rich people acting poor,8
CSK and SRH legend Nehraji in the dugout,13
When was the last we scored a boundary lol?,3
This looks like csk batting.,11
"Get Williamson, win the match.",9
This reminds me of India defending 230-260 targets in 2012 with Ashwin & Jadeja choking out the batsmen with dot balls and then boom a wicket,11
"If Kane gets out , they aren't winning.

If Kane don't strike , they will definitely not win.

Lol what a shit situation.",18
"You would think with 3 international foreign player up top, it‚Äôs the average bowling attack that would be letting you down",9
105 off 9. One of these 2 should get going. SRH don't have Lord Tewatia.,8
CSK winning only because they batted first for a change today. Its funny how quickly opinions and overall feeling around a team can change in cricket.,9
"Yep, we'll leave everything for the last 5 overs.",8
Chepauk Choke,6
This is the well known CSK squeeze **TM** that won them so many tournaments.,5
Watching CSK play like this makes me wanna shitpost * 100 times.,7
What are the chances that Nehra has an MSD body pillow at his home,6
Apple event or middle over batting of SRH at 10:30...hmmü§î,6
‚ÄúYeh wala badiya h‚Äù xD,3
"IPL 2020: Win toss, bat 1st, win game

Exceptions being when your opponent is Mumbai or have Tewatia",15
I hope CSK wins more tosses so that they can choose to bat first. Batting second is clearly difficult,8
Jaddu one more wicket pls,6
Kane will win this for SRH. He hasn‚Äôt got a long opportunity this season and just needs some support from the other end.,0
Garg needs to accelerate rn,4
Was there at least a single six in SRH's innings?,5
And we are seeing the familiar Jaddu. Comes and finishes off 4 overs in no time.,7
csk should shomehow get kane and make him the captain once dhenier retires.,17
"Tbf this year was coming for us. You can't expect Warner to score brilliantly every year, an off year from him (by his standards) would cost us badly.",8
Feels just like home,2
The RRR is creeping up.,5
"9 more overs of full-time spinners left after this, looks very ominous for SRH. 

Credit where its due, CSK have handled their bowlers perfectly this game",7
As a csk fan I m lovin it,10
ü•±ü•±ü•±ü•±ü•±,3
Daddy Williamson showing some style!,10
Chad kanos rocking 100+ sr.,7
Is kanos about to snap?,6
"I love you Kane but Where is the INTENT

Edit: I should never doubt KANOS",9
Class !!!,5
I like dugout today,6
So close :(,3
Everyone talks about dhoni the finisher. What I love most is Dhoniconda the constrictor when we have runs on the board,13
Big Daddy Kane LOL,1
"Considering how Spinners are finding it really easy here, I'm feeling that Rashid should have done better than 0-30.",9
Such a joy to watch Kane bat..,8
Here we go men,3
If CSK had Raina this would have been much more Entertaining then they could have dropped Watson ages ago,5
Big daddy Kane!! Calm down  Pommy,16
Hope great player like Priyam Garg won't get affected by Dhoni's presence. Yashasvi Jaiswal already bit the dust,3
SRH Dugout looks way more confident than the fans on this thread üòí,2
2 boundaries after Power bolay came in this over only,4
Kanos have my babies,5
"Kanos makes it all worth it 
Fucking beautyy and does it with the elbow guard, respectful of everyone .",6
 What's wrong with opening with your best batsmen rather than pretend to be strengthening your middle order when your best batsmen face barely 10ish deliveries? Ex: Stokes at RR this year. Don't understand the flak their management is getting.,4
"Loading song .....

""Right here ... Right Now .....""

Fatboy slim",4
Wtf so the only batsman after this is 3D shankar?,6
"Williamson never fails to impress !!
This guy is a legend.",4
Choke me daddy Kaneüòçüòç,6
Should Kanos be permanently batting at 3 ?,7
Big Daddy Kane lmaooo,5
I think we should bring in holder and virat for bairstow and priyam,0
No Kane no Gain,5
Which teams have won while chasing this season so far?,3
It all depends on how chawla bowls now.,5
"I love you Kane, but please get out.",11
Kanos is starting to run away here. Somebody stop him.,6
I repeat. Shankar will win the match today. He was raised in chepauk.,10
"U see srh has warner, bairstow and kanos, u'll think they r definitely top 2( not like rcb, srh bowling was always good)",8
"""big daddy kane""



Calm down Pommy",23
what is the winrate while batting first this season? I think it may be higher than previous seasons,5
Get Going Garg.,1
Oh we haven't bowled Chawla or Bravo yet with one Curran over at the death hmm,3
"I still remember the first csk v srh encounter in 2018. Williamson hit 80 odd runs and finally lost by 4 runs. I'm sorry Kanos, you're gonna have to get OUT NOW!",1
Whoever is writing in cricbuzz is a regular r/cricket user. I see intent intent frequently.,7
"2 boundaries in a row, what is happening, this overwhelming feeling. We are not used to these",12
Big Daddy Kane lol,6
"If Kane was batting at 3 , this match was much more easier.",5
Kane is looking scary man,7
SRH can back themselves.....Bravo will bowl a few and then Curran..... Thakur is hit or miss,5
Big Daddy Kane üíóüíóüíó,8
Gargy boi let's see some lap shots eh.,6
"""Big Daddy Kane""  
That my style of commentary",11
That's gotta be...[that's gotta be Kane!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASmdxXaOzd4),6
Still 4 overs of Chawla to come!!,6
He did not just call Mahela unattractive,11
[deleted],11
Sharma-ji ka beta.. do something bro,6
Fortunes changed because we removed useless nehra.,6
Garg wtf u doing,5
Bruh Dhoni saying badiya karan after every ball. Love my captain.,8
Why that dude Bayliss wearing a full brim hat. My dude it‚Äôs night time. Is he wearing it as a fashion statement?,8
"Opinion: keep pandey as 12th man for specialist fielder and play a bowler or all rounder in his place, pushing kanos to 3",6
"Boon in disguise for India probably with the T20 world cup postponed. They can try guys like SKY and Nattu in the upcoming T20Is, along with Iyer, Pant and Ishan Kishan. I genuinely think India will be the favourites to win the world cup along with England if they can get a solid team with a combination of youngsters and experience. Hardik will get time to recover from his injury and will be a handy bowler. We can try Krunal as well. Many options.",7
Garg bhenchod if you can't hit even Karn Sharma then what are you even doing here,1
Surely these 2 are the most boring teams this tournament?,15
"Kanos is gonna pull this off somehow guys, I'm telling ya",11
Didn't Karn Sharma play a test for India? Wonder why he was not playing regularly in the IPL last few years.,2
"Why Csk might end up last this season... because they have dropped Jagadeesan, persisting with Bravo.....they might win this match ,,and they will retain the same team",5
Kane pls get out ! Don‚Äôt spoil this very rare day of happiness,0
"Nehra is a bum with these cricket opinions, entertaining but deffo not a good coms/coach/analyst.",10
"Wait, Garg knows Hindi, why is Dhoni still giving instructions in Hindi to his bowlers?",5
Garg has to put them floaty ones into the stands,4
I am not saying they should start hitting now but they should totally start hitting it now,3
Garg can't score before settling in. So matter what we shout he is going to take time. If it works and he hits great if he doesn't then that is the limitation of selecting him.,4
Who are the two DC batsmen in the lenskart jakati ad?,2
This is it guys csk redemption smh,5
4 overs of chawla left...don't know if that's a good thing or bad,5
Mfs we ball deep.,4
Dhoni knows priyam garg kidhar achha khelta hai? Do they really prepare for each batsman?,5
Piyush Chawla - specialist fielder,7
Chawla has not even bowled yet...,2
"Chahar just want to touch Kane, he is not leaving.",8
There you go. Tahir.,6
"Chawla isn't going to bowl today, is he?",5
Tahir got that wolverine look,13
Gargggggleeeee.,4
Run out almost. So close to peak entertainment.,5
Can srh still win?,1
Is that Tahir or Wolverine in disguise?,6
"honestly torn between both teams, want some last moment shenanigans so srh should be more viable but on the other hand, Dhoni.

I think I'll just stick to supporting whoever is winning and act real smug about it.",6
God I miss Tahir's energy,10
If vvs saw himself in garg he was goddamn right,3
Garg just go man,6
Need Tahir on CSK.. I love the way he celebrates when he takes a wicket,8
"Tahir seems like such a humble dude, get him in csk if you can.",7
"Last year purple cap winner, this year bench warmer",9
He‚Äôs turned into a caveman out of depression,3
Wait. That was a 4!,2
"Fuck, last year's purple cap holder is yet to get a chance",7
Chawla was the one who caught that match winning catch in CWB in Australia (2008),6
Thala Garg taking it deep,4
"Man, I really miss tahir's Olympic run.",10
"Inject that shot, love it gargy boi.",7
damn tahir looks so sad,8
Bravo is way passed his sell by date,7
Tahir so wholesome please give him a match üòî,12
"Why would you take his interview.

Take raina's interview as well ask him why are you not playing.",5
That's simple elegant shot. Didn't look like 4. Few more these so I can analyse,4
"Don't think Curran should bowl right at the death, he should finish his spell next over",2
Still shocks me how a 41 year old got a purple cap,5
What's the point in playing chawla when you're not bowling him. Dude hardly brings anything in the field too,6
[removed],7
Why are they asking tahir abt young Indian players....he plays for csk,7
Does this Garg has any power in him?,3
Just bring back Lord Shadab Jakati and this seems like old CSK,3
SRH has a very weak middle order. Get Kane and it's match over.. Garg should take all chances and Kane should anchor till 18th over at least.,7
Garg chutiye stop wasting balls . Williamson has 8 dot balls and you already have 6,3
I want to see tahir run,1
How dare they list Faf as a batsman. He averages 19 with an economy rate of 6.3 in T20s with 50 wickets.,8
[deleted],3
I saw Raina on Instagram reels in the nets the other day. BC what are you practicing for,4
Tahir seems like a genuinely good dude,7
"Priyam shouting ""Chalo Chalo"" to Kanos. That's why there's Run out drama between these two.",30
Ooof,4
That was a tough chance,4
Close but no cigar,6
"Oh thank god, I almost thought he caught it.",11
"""There is no doubt about it"" by Nehra ji 100th time already challenging 'intent'",7
Tahir's just a team player. Love to see it,4
Kane will find a way to win of he doesn't gets out.,8
"If pitches get like realllllyyyy slow, watch csk play 4 spinners +bravo",11
Garg need to start hitting,3
CSK are clowns for not playing Immi,7
the only place Tahir should be at is the bowling crease.,6
That was close,3
"Priyam: Chalo chalo chalo

Kanos: Betichod angrezi bol le",46
"Lol Priyam shouting ""chalo chalo chalo"" to Kane out of instinct. (*chalo = run)*",12
"This is like a hostage video.

I am very happy at csk.
They are treating me well here.",28
"If Dhoni loses this match, with 7 bowlers on a turning pitch...

It will be a thing",10
Absolute shit wicket-keeping.,3
What's the rationale in not playing Imran?,4
"BC, need a 20 runs over",7
Bravo leaking runs,4
One of these two will have to go mad.,8
Tahir is so wholesome.,5
Tahir deserves to play.,2
Dhenier making sure his successor looks good to CSK fans.,5
"Speaking of Tahir, how good was he at dc?",1
Nice little cameo from a guy that had the purple cap last year.,14
"Why the garg hate guys, he looks good and is his first season 
Start giving him big time stick if he does it 3 seasons in
Pandey, dhawan unload, garg, gill not so much 
Just a suggestion after all.",4
Is it weird that I wanna touch Kanos's beard?,21
"SRH management should open their eyes and invest in some match winning middle order players ,it's been our problem for years.",5
"""fielding chennai ki takat nahi hai "", in the same match bravo fucked up pandey ji with a direct hit?",3
Just bring hazlewood for bravo,2
Ah Frick,1
IMO kane is the best when it comes to risk free 125 SR cricket.,7
"Chawla to bowl 19th over

Secret Intel",13
Man Kane is such an elegant batsman so lovely to watch.,1
It isn't over yet bois,1
"D. Bravo - Right-arm fast-medium

LIESSSS! He's not a slow bowler whose 'special' ball is the fast one",10
Wait what no Chawla for real?,6
"I like this Pakistani Saffa hybrid accent. On words like ""team"" the Saffa is clearly heard.",6
Is thala using karthiks tactics?,8
"Garg trying to sweep boys, so he wants to hit boundaries.",5
"K hear me out.... If bravo continues to disappoint with the bat, then play Tahir cuz he is a better bowling option on slow track",10
Virat kohli of NZ? Wtf. Kane's kane,36
gote gaye hote,5
"Lose 2 early wickets, stabilize the innings, run rate rises

SRH doing a CSK ... against CSK",29
Pitch slow as shit,11
SRH deserve to lose if they can't hit Chawla and Bravo,10
oye.. Sharmaji!!,4
"wtf is the point of Chawla if you‚Äôre not gonna bowl him, he can‚Äôt even a field",8
Kane is not Virat Kohli of NZ. Kane is Kane of NZ,23
"2 wife's, intelligent cricket.",3
"If a person and a rectangle had a child together, its face would look like Karn Sharma's",2
So many easy singles and 2s,2
Why does karn sharma look like the spin version of Lord Umesh?,6
Karn still playing for SRH on the inside,7
Karn Sharma has the funniest action,8
 Glad MS forgot that Chawla was playing,33
Where are the sixes man,6
Garg....,6
Kinda sad to see that Kane is being treated as the last hope to win the match even tho ma man Vijay Babu is still to come.,1
YES YES YES !!,3
OHHHH,2
3D time,2
Dont mind two wides in exchange of a wicket.,3
"Chawla looking like a proper lala, behenchod Piyush ""Salad""la ban ja kabhi",6
Being a wicket keeper is so chill. Just wave around players and stare at them if they fuck up,6
In comes 3D,3
Garg BC. is this why you played tuk tuk till now. Fuck off,5
"Come on, Garg, wtf man.",7
Send Rashid,3
**3D** time,5
Incoming 3D,4
Garg killed off the match,5
"The way CSK'S season has been , I expected Jaddu to parry that over and make it a six!",4
Garg was struggling,1
Now what? Shankar Anna?,8
Don't worry guys lord Shankar is yet to come!,3
It's good that mark nicholas has a soothing voice cause some of the shit he says is disappointing,5
Garg wasted 3 overs,1
Good shot but too flat,2
Samad >>>> Garg,1
Root Kohli Williamson Smith all have same body type and similar height,5
watching this as a neutral I‚Äôm just interested in knowing how many times the dugout guys get their predictions right,2
 Gaikwad fielding for rayudu?,1
What's point of playing like that. Waste balls and gets out .  It was better if he would have try to hit six every ball.,1
SRH need a Fabian Allen who is the next Russell/Pollard in the making.,3
"That shot was looking real good, untill I realised this isn't sharjah",5
Dugout predicted Garg's wicket.,3
Straight to the man. And we're one batsman short. Time for 3D to do some magic.,6
"Kanos after Garg holes out in the deep ""Chalo chalo chalo""",4
"Right, I have officially given up all hope. I'm off to play Mafia instead",7
that was a weird shot. play straight,2
Congrats garg u just wasted balls,3
BITS AND PIECES^(TM),9
"Even getting out he looks good, but he has to bat top 4, 5 too low with pandey and kano ahead of him 
He opens or bats 3 for his stateside I think",3
Has Chawla done anything?,2
Lo n Behold 3D Player is here!,7
Bc played 3 overs and scored 16. While our khaleel will give it in 2 over. What a noob,2
we have to rely on 3D lord shankar to help Kane now...,2
"Csk Fans : damn play Tahir also we are going to lose. 


Srh fans : we need middle order players, also we are going to lose. 


Everyone else : Kane Kane Kane uwu uwu uwu",10
Impossible to chase this season,6
Things are getting sticky,6
That was middled should not have been a wicket.,5
3D Shankar in,11
"Dugout has got  the script , I'm telling you",11
"**3D**

**3D**

**3D**",12
That was an excellent section of commentary. I liked it.,6
"God, that vi squeaking sound is so irritating",7
Jadeja made it look like eating a cake....it wasnt lol,6
very Pandey like innings from Garg,9
3D,3
Jaddu man of the match. Didn't even have his customary drop on boundary today.,4
It gets extremely difficult to bat in the second innings in all the grounds with the ball gripping and stopping. I think the only team which did decently well in the second innings was MI. Toss is so crucial man.,7
So no one wants Santner in the XI instead of Tahir/Hazlewood?,3
Just Kane now. Plizz.,4
"Garg should get his photo updated lol, his current pic looks like he should be learning coding at Whitehat Jr.",21
Shankar walks out - Ambati Rayudu triggered,10
Shankar dada MBBS .. .. .. ..,6
Only LORD could save SRH from here,6
3D time..,3
Damn commentators are taking a piss off Shankar,4
Thala dropped Jagadeesan because he made Rayudu run too much.,11
3D time!,7
"Only thing stopping us now is a Kanos masterclass, and I won't complain if that happens just like Kohli last time.

3D is here though, should be spicy.",4
Time for 3D boi?,2
So happy for karn. You can see he is trying to give his 100 percent. Piyush gets preferred in the previous matches who also is a terrible fielder.,5
"Should be easy for India and NZ‚Äôs no. 4 batsmen, shouldn‚Äôt it?",9
"Fuck, I forgot Shankar exists.",6
"Vijay had played a breezy knock vs SRH once. Boundaries, 4s, 6s. He is capable.",4
Don't blame Garg here. I this he played well given are playing with 1 batsman less. Blame the braindead management for going with 1 batsman less with batting being our weakness.,4
Williamson would screw us if he doesn't get out,1
Why does kaddu reverse cup everything?,1
"two nice guys batting.. from csk perspective, hope they dont finish last",2
"Inb4 Rayudu comes snatching the ball from whoever would bowl next over if 3D is on strike, bowl 5 wide Yorkers for which he has no answers and then another yorker to the stump and shows a middle finger to him. A man can only dream",8
Rayadu will have +5 fielding power now boys,6
"**14.4** Sharma to Garg, OUT, **picks out deep midwicket!** A clean lofted sweep from Garg, hit powerfully enough that he might have got a four a couple of metres to Jadeja's right. But he's got this from off stump and straight into the hands **99-4**

PK Garg c Jadeja b Sharma 16 (18b 1x4 0x6) SR: 88.88",0
I honestly never seen 3D perform,5
Out goes Garg!!! Now Williamson needs to get out soon too.,0
"3D in, bowl Rayudu coward Thala",5
67 in 5 is pretty doable but wish srh had some pinch hitters,5
3D player in the crease,5
"Since Shankar didn't get to bowl to Rayudu, can we get Rayudu to bowl to Shankar :p",7
"Good call shankar,there is no two.",7
"Shankar has spoken in so many interviews about how CSK is the one team he wants to excel against. 

This is your chance, lad.",8
Shiiit that was some good fielding by qran,0
Can this be the one game that Vijay Shankar shows up for us?,7
67 from 30 is gettable. Need 3D fireworks though,4
"Moment Kane decide to accelerate  , someone gets out.",3
Small sample size but Priyam Garg doesn't look like a good player in pressure situations tbh. Got out for single digit scores in the 2 KO matches in U-19 WC too.,1
Karn a better Piyush?,1
They should have promoted Rashid he can score runs real quick and could have released pressure from Kane,2
SRH are horrible chasers.,2
Karn Sharma the car salesman who sold a fully loaded gold altroz to a broke Swanny and laughed all the way to the bank.,4
Let Rayudu bowl Shankar for the memes plzzz,3
"We didn't get Buttler bowling to ashwin


Give us Rayudu bowling to 3d atleast :(",5
This upgrad donkey ad will make sense if people lick the right body part,9
NGL Rohit‚Äôs acting is so good in the Dream11 ad. ‚ÄúOpener hoon na üòèüòèüòè‚Äù,13
Has 3D Shankar played an innings of substance ever since he got branded with the 3D tag? He's been as successful as 3D TVs were.,5
For SRH this kind of Target now seems impossible to chase. They lack pinch hitters.,4
"Did you mean Karn or Curran

Commentator: ""Yes""",6
We need one big over,3

Specialist death bowler,3
"KKR/RCB guys - who are you rooting for? 

CSK - bocs SRH will get closer to top 4 

SRH bcos this game should not be ""resurgance"" of CSK?

SRH - bocs, F CSK.",1
67 from 30 .....25 twos + 3 sixes,5
If pitches start to turn and grip csk will be a force in second half. Dhoni will play as many spinner as he can and squeeze the opposition .,3
Nooo why Piyush,2
At least 3 sixes needed from V J Shankar,4
66 off 5 should give you hope. Don't look at wickets in hand.,5
There was a time when the commentators would  read out the top tweets during the match wonder why they stopped that,8
Wait it's 15 overs and Piyush Chawla hasn't bowled one yet? Why is he playing? Wonder if he'll get an over in the last 5.,4
Jay Shah picking his nose in Live TV! wtf,6
"Chawla the death bowler

Edit: specialist death bowler",6
Why does Piyush Chawla look like a fat Rowan Atkinson,8

Yeah...it's too late. We really miss a Ben Cutting/Yuvraj/Bipul Sharma kind of number 7,7

They're not able to hit 10 runs an over for a while. Idk how they intend to hit 15 an over,5
How are we so bad at sixes 0 of em so far,10
Faf and Chawla (yet) didn't contribute much and still chennai is in winning position. Nice,3

"The boundaries are too big and SRH has absolutely no power as one of the commentators pointed out. Warner has lost his edge, Bairstow is hit and miss, Kane don't have muscle, Garg is Kane Lite, 3D is.. Well 3D!",9
"So Garg played 17 balls with zero intent, and got out on the first ball he showed intent, but some people here blaming Vijay Shankar for trying to take 3-4 balls to settle. 

Sucks he's not a *youngster* I guess",12
"Win toss, bat first, win match",12
59 off 4 overs is tight he says. Love T20 cricket hahaha,8
Somehow get Kane's wicket and I'll unclench.,6
There is more chance of Williamson running six runs than hitting sixes at this stage,11
Kane definitely looks zoned in. SRH has a real chance of winning it. CSK have been usually terrible at the death too,1
This Chawla strategy analogous to how Narine was used in the past few matches is a really clever way of preventing batsman from changing gear at the right time preventing the finish,3
Chawla is like a government employee. Collecting a paycheque for doing a minimal job,10
"r/cricket when Dhoni bats slowly in a chase: Loser! He‚Äôs just padding stats! He‚Äôs lost it. Go home MS! Your time is done!

r/cricket when Williamson bats slowly in a chase: What a masterful chase. Knows exactly when to accelerate. Do you need a slow blowjob along with that slow innings, Kane?",12

34% win percentage is a mercy given this is our last recognized batting pair.,13
Dhoni talking to the bowler? This match is important I guess,6
I love Kanos and he's holding this together but he needs to up the ante and hit out now. Can't expect 3D to get this done.,7
Get in rayudu to bowl his nasty off break. And show his new dimension to his nemesis,6
3d gone,7

LMAO. I guess that was for the best. Rashid is better than Shankar anyway.,6
"lack of stroke players is a big issue for so many teams. CSK, SRH(very little after its top order) and KXP(only KL, Mayank and Pooran are able to score).  KKR with so much talent are also struggling. Only MI, DC and  RR have shown consistent stroke playing",4
Shankar sucks,1
Something tells me Rashid Khan will tee off as well!,6
That's Shankar's T20 career done.,1
"Match is not even close to over, rashid has ascended",2
3D gone for a wide. Fml.,1
That would have been wide,1
So basically the best way to figure out what CSK is planning against you is to check out where Jadeja is on the field,5
Rashid khan my captain in fantasy just smoke 2-3 sixes,6
Okay kane now you have to start going for it,3
That single scream was Rayudu orgasming,6

"**16.4** Bravo to Shankar, OUT, **taken at deep backward point.** Full and wide, that's the plan, and that's what the field is set for. Shankar reaches out and slices it straight to Jadeja **117-5**

V Shankar c Jadeja b Bravo 12 (7b 0x4 1x6) SR: 171.42",1
SO THE 3D player actually got out for 12(10) and didn't get to bowl an over. Well done Vijay Jankar,2
Ambati just creamed his pants.,1
Rayudu would have celebrated,2
Petition for CSK to bat first every game,7
Other teams are nervous about CSK now. You can‚Äôt keep them out of the playoffs,8
Sir Jadeja is the real 3D player,6
*Rayudu giggles at cow corner*,9
3D GO PLAY WORLD CUP NAH,5
Just get everyone else out I guess....,3
Poor ball but poor judgement and poor shot. Should've left it for a wide. Gift of a wicket,2
"Rashid used to be a pinch hitter at the death in BBL, what happened now?",5
"3 dimensional innings with a forward defense, a ball in the stands and a ball down the throat of the fielder.",4
I guess I'm not watching a good vijay shankar innings today either :),2
Shit,1
Eternal youngster is in,2
Shankar just seems like a wannabe Kedar Jadhav,3
Rashid Khan still bothers me.,2
Feels good to be on the other side of 50 off 20 balls needed to win lol,3
I just realised that csk is playing 7 proper bowlers. No wonder there batting is often shit.,0
Bruh I really like Shankar and want him to do well but every damn time he disappoints,3
Tbh Bravo was poor last season too.,2
Stoinis is gonna have a field day against Bravo in Sharjah,2
"Fact : Shankar has best SR of the match

Haters gonna be haters",6
Why is cow corner unguarded?,1
kanos is still on the crease guizz,4
Ambati Rayudu will be the most happiest person in this world right now,9
So anything above 140 and that's match done for team batting second,7
Damn.. followed with a full toss...,3
"Star sports showing ads for MI vs KKR since the Weekend , Who are they trying to fool ?",10
"Kanos is love, kanos is life",12
"Ughhh even as my team does well in IPL, I just want it to get over and for India to play. Wish I could skip time.",1
This is from where RR won against us last game. We can't even imagine to pull it off in our wildest dreams. Lack of proper Indian power hitters will always continue to haunt us.,7
Get Williamson out please,8
Lights go off. Crazy wwe music starts blaring. Gilchrist walks in wearing  Deccan Chargers Jersey at number 9.,11
Vijay Shankar is just a waste.. never understood how he is even qualified for ipl let alone Indian team.. if people like MSK prasad become selectors this is what we will get,1
Hope Kane does  like Abd today,3
Kane Williamson lost Hyderabad the match,-8
The CSK hate recently almost feels like Idubz made a content cop on them,3
Poor execution from Bravo,6
"2018 flashback

Kane doing everything alone.",11
At least the consecutive 50 streak continues,4
Kane my man. Lone warrior.,4
I Have seen Rashid hiting sixes too may be there's some hope remaining,5
Kanos is literally one man army,4
3d boi got fucked,3
"We can't afford 3D


3D is costly, so we can watch short span in our budget.",5
Please get out Kane. Please.,4
Need a 20-run over,3
97 kmph.,3
Kanos needs to go üö®üö®,2
I've a feeling that we're gonna lose. Idk why.,4
Wtf Chawla charge,3
"I swr, if kanos carries srh I'm turning bi",6
"played kanos, now get out pls",7
Rashid is a dangerous guy at this stage. Can seriously do some damage here.,4
Williamson PTSD,5
Kan fighting a lone battle,3
Man really sucks to be nabi,3
"52 in 36 balls,take a bow kane.

 shame on young cunts in our team. They have so many opportunities still shitting in bed.",5
16 per over for last 3 overs is very doable,5
Our team might be slower but we're certainly smarter.  Now chase 50 in 3 overs with Williamson!,2
I fucking hate the Super V name.,3
SRH dropped both Abhishek and Samad who are lower order hitters,6
big boi Chawla going to bowl in death,2
If cricket was rap. Ambati and Shankar would've clicked a photo together already and squash this non existent beef.,2
3D player has turned into a poor man's Lord Binny,4
Big fan of commentators trying their hardest to pronounce his name and coming up with Rashee Kaan,7
"Definitely Thakur Curran Thakur after that over

EDIT: uh oh",3
Why haven't I watched Kane struggling on any pitch against any attack in any situation?,5
"Bravo might bowl another over. 
PTSD ^ STONKS",6
Imagine the state of your batting line-up if Kane is the guy you depend on to score 50 runs in 18 balls,4
"I'll be the first to say I like Mark Nicholas as a commentator, he has such a nice voice for it and clearly knows his stuff. HOWEVER, he's always complimenting however is on screen, praising their skills and is always very professional/diplomatic. I would love one day for someone like Ponting to do one of the mid-match interviews, and after the interview all the commentators are chatting about how he's such a good cricketer, only for Nicholas to chime in with ""I agree he was fantastic to watch, he was a bit of a dick though wasn't he?"" Or someone like Thakur comes on to bowl and he just explains how his speciality is bowling 6 pies an over",6
Williamson will silence the haters,3
Kanos..not today please :(,1
"Things I like about CSK: Watto, Du Plessis, Raina

Things I hate about CSK: Everything else",2
"bravo bowls too many loose delivery now days
csk should bring imran tahir in place of him
as the pitches are turning here now
and dhoni know how to operate spinners",2
"Now all 4 foreign players are indispensable.

The bowling has been decent

Manish and Shankar need to play better

7 sixes or 4 sizes and 3 fours will do it.,2
Nah not happening 46 off 16  too far for us,1
Where are the yorkers man,1
uh god.. Rashid Khan is going to swing full force.,2
Karn will throw as wide as possible.,1
"Is it just me, or did previous IPLs NOT have this chasing down 60 off last 4 pattern? (Unless the target was 190+)",1
How did that ball look slower that a spinners' yet was the same speed (maybe faster) than most spinners?,3
Love watching Kane play like this.,4
25 run over incoming,2

"Yeah, the Hindi commentators start jizzing about field placement.",2

Superb innings from kane- best of both teams,5
Good night,3
Williamson is a great batsman but he's not a power hitter or Finisher.,3
"It's ok kanos, you tried",8
Respect Kanos. Respect.,5
"I am just few minutes away from quitting Reddit just like i said before. SRH played very bad. Goodbye, you all.",4
Aaaaaand it's over,1
Williamson's placement is on point,2
Csk might be my team but seeing kane sad breaks my heart.,7
Can we not have some luck for once goddamnit,3
CSK is back babyy,1

Ahh shit here we go again. Who do CSK play next?,1
Nadeem doubled in size over the summer,2
"Perfect match

Srh lost

Kane performed

What more I can ask.",2
Our world class spinner gets thumped when he‚Äôs trusted in the death against two inexperienced batsmen. Their b-grade spinner wins the game for them against our experienced batsman. Says a lot about how shit our team is.,0
Just Rashid now.,2
This has not been the type of innings that Kanos can save for the past 5 overs. He did well though,4
Srh losing is a good news for RR,2
Naeem against Karn. Not really liking this,2
"Good, courageous bowling by the leggie. Instead of bowling it quicker and flatter and giving Kanos pace to work with, he bowlers it slower and gave it more air and asked him to generate all the power.",3
Where should I signup to support RCB in playoffs ?,6
Kept the hopes high. Played Kanos.,1
Fuck you csk don't you dare win the IPL from here,9
"CSK needs to get Kane as captain in post MS era. Then try to get few good Indian batsmen(Surya, Rana, Kishan, Shaw, Gill etc must be bid for).",2
Post the post match thread right now the match is over.,3
"Man Dhoni called the wicket before the 2nd ball was bowled. He told karn ""Yeh hath me jayega"".",6
Has Nadeem put on some muscle?,5
That banana definitely helped karan!!,4
Good night guys. At least Kane innings helped us to not give up and loose bad. There goes my hopes of playoffs for this season.,10

"**17.2** Sharma to Williamson, OUT, **taken at long-on.** The plan's come off. Williamson reaching out for the slog sweep as Karn tosses it up slow and at a length outside off. Can't manage to get the power on that to clear the boundary **126-6**

What happened to players like Moises Henriques and Ben Cutting,6
Lord Thakur do your thing,2
Thakur ko nali main bhej de,2
"Rant 

Just imagine being Kane.

You are removed from captaincy once Warner comes in. You are constantly moved across the lineup. You are constantly asked to carry the team to the Victory and yet you don't even get a decent support from any other batsmen and sone idiots would even blame you for taking risks when it is necessary. 

In the end SRH doesn't deserve Kane and deserves to be in the bottom half of the list. 


End of Rant",36

Shouldn't Dhoni get demerit points ???,9
Spineless umpiring,2
Csk umpire,1
You all got it wrong Dhoni suggested that its a wide,9
I want csk to win for my selfish reasons . But not giving wide was a shity decision.,1
So he didn't give it a wide under duress. This ain't fair lol,10
"Give that a wide, balance it out paul.",4
how much csk paid to umpire,10
Lost respect for CSK,10
Ye bhosadpappu commentators wide ka toh nhi bolenge..,2
That was absolute bullshit from MSD and especially the umpire,13
Ngl looking difficult for SRH now,3

Dhoni and Thakur should be written up for this. I'm saying this as a CSK fan.,23
"Good boy, shardul",2
Game over,3

Brilliant umpiring by Dhoni,18

Umpire: I'm not getting paid enough for this shit.,14
FAIR PLAY AWARD,11

Dhoni intimidating umpire,10
Why is Rashid just flicking the bat?,13
Phew üòå üòå,4
Warner reaction is gold,11

Thala has become Ricky of 2008,14

**LORD SHARDUL HAS QUANTUM POWER TO MANIPULATE SPACETIME TO CHANGE DECISION**,13
Hit wicket lmao wtf,5
Threatening umpire lol,12
The ump should call a no ball now,6
Will Karn Sharma bowl the last over? Pls pls pls make him bowl the last over,2
"Hit + catch
Is this happened before?",1
You'd think Dhoni can't stoop any lower huh?,14
Sometimes I wonder if Rashid applies any thinking while batting..,2
Guess who barged in on the field when a similar decision was reversed against CSK last year?,16
That one over and that one dropped catch will haunt all csk fans forever if we lose,1
Double wicket! This was rare!,3
Thakur you gem.,2
Dhoni didn‚Äôt even yell üòÇY‚Äôall love to hate,0
Samad in pandey lut for srh can't drop garg so soon.,0
Reiffel intimidated by thala. But well csk not playing fair now,8
"Haha. The catcher didn't got a catch, I think.",2
Why do we even have umpires? Let dhoni make all the decisions from now on,12
[deleted],0
Dhoni has actually turned into a bully now. Nothing can be more disappointing.,15
That‚Äôs what you get for idiotic stances,0
Why was that not given as wide?,6
Bro..this looks fixed..... I am sorry I don't want tovbe that person. Wide not given. Nadeem said something to rashid before this ball. Idk.,-6
"Again, at least he tried",7
Wait what xD,1
Lol Rashid,-1
"For all the bullying, how the fuck CSK keep on winning fair play awards? This isn't the first time Dhoni and co pulled this shit.",7
Ggwp Bois,2
Thats a wide. Stupid umpire.,12
Fairplay doesn't matter if you are not making into the playoffs.,2
Was that a wide? I'm confused.,2
"All the shit shardul gets , this was one hell of a over , WELL BOWLED",4
*match fixing comments intensify*,2
Watson are watching the batsman run: ‘Ö( Õí €ù Õí )·ï§,5
People who had Chahar in Fantasy Team - Abbe yaar ab cheating karoge toh mein yeh game nahi khelunga,2
Yess Tucker my boy. What an over.,2
Hit wicket nullifies catch. Hence not out /s,6
Wouldn't trust Bravo to contain Rashid in the last over - good he's dismissed now.,1
Man if that reaction doesn't draw some attention the standards are under question! What was the umpire doing there!,12
Thala has way too much power in world cricket.,8
"Thala is a trash captain  , Umpires should face consequences for that",12
Dhoni go fuck yourself bro,10
"I now want csk to lose it, how the fuck can you intimidate an umpire",2
Dhoni bullying the umpire to not give a wide.  this is the problem when  players are treated as bigger than the sport.,18
"lol they wanted thala to win so bad, they made Rashid get out two ways just for safety",5
Fair play to CSK for helping out umpires with their workload,10
Got out twice off same ball,5
"Omg it is a Hit wicket.

My inner voice: Aadiya aatam ennaa....üòÇüòÇ",4
Dogshit umpiring Srini Mama activated,10
Hahaha got out twice from one ball,2
"Want DC to whoop CSK ass after this incident and out of the tournament. If not DC, MI will do it themselves.",-3
Ahaha out twice in one ball wtf,9
"Damn that was nasty, however it would still be the umpires fault for being swayed if he did but nasty stuff from Dhoni",4
the amount of trust Dhoni has on Bravo... man,2
Why does Dhoni's hairline look so wierd?,-1
Fuck dhoni,4
I think Dhoni's evil twin turns up for CSK. He never was this aggressive in the national setup.,7
HAHAHHAA MY OPPONENT HAD CHAHAR IN HIS FANTASY TEAM LMAOOOOO,2
Fake captain cool and fake finisher,1
where's curry chan üò¢,1
"First fielder dropped catch, now umpire uncle dropped coin",5

"SHARDUL THAKUR, OH MY üí¶üçÜüí¶üçÜüí¶üçÜüí¶üçÜ",1
Dhoni influencing umpires again?,8
FO csk,1
Watch CSK still get full points in the Fair Play table.,7
Love it when r/cricket cringes when a umpiring decisions goes in favour of csk,4
"Shouting at the umpire before he gives a wide, hit wicket, this is some classic gully cricket stuff",9
Rashid put zero energy into the shot. Could have tonked it.,3
"Why is everyone blaming dhoni, players always do that. Literally every player does that. It was spineless umpiring",7
"""If it's two dismissals, what about the other batsman being given out""

Kill me now plz.",2
Dhoni acting like a school bully.,2
CSK will still be at the top of the fAiR pLaY aWaRd.,7
Chahar should have yoinked the ball at the umpire,1
What the actual fuck was going on that over,8
Imagine being so bad that you have to bully an umpire into not giving a wide so that you can save a run üò≠,2
I'm still furious about the retracted Wide this is shit,8
Now watch CSK move to the top of the fair play award.,11
üëÅÔ∏èüëÑüëÅÔ∏è Could this be.... ?,1
Dhoni has gone rogue lol,12
"**18.6** Thakur to Rashid Khan, OUT, **taken at long-on.** Low full toss outside off, looks to play the helicopter shot but once again he's not behind the line of this for that shot. Holes out. **Oh but he's also got so deep in the crease that his back leg has pushed off stump back.** **146-7**

Rashid Khan hit wicket b Thakur 14 (8b 1x4 1x6) SR: 175.00",0
"~~young afghan boy fucked by old daddy~~

young afghan boy fucked himself",4
"Lol what's with Dravid and cardekho ad, too funny it's like he doesn't even care",3
Rashid so scared he actually hit his own wicket.,-1
"Dhoni said ""he was moving"" and the umpire decided against his wide....

If the batsman moves the wide line moves as well.",9
"Fuck oFF the Umpire should be banned man, these are the cases which gives suspicions to match fixing.",9
Thakur has been seriously good this year. Should be the main death bowler not Bravo!,0
Thala shouts and a wide ball becomes legal delivery. Epic level: thala,18
This is not fair play,11
Ok why does hit wicket go into bowler's account as a wicket??,2
Umpires will reward CSK with 11 fair play points.,20
"Oh bios we got this, so much hard work",3
Nadeem with dancing shoes on..,4
Captain cool ....my ass,14
"Oh yeah because if the wide was called SRH would have won with 56 balls to spare. Give it a rest. What they did was wrong, but don‚Äôt fall victim to Pietersen doing his best Piers Morgan impersonation",-10
Moved back and forth only to miss LMAO,9
"When you wear yellow shirt, you start umpiring sometimes",14
You either die hero or live long enough to see yourself turn into Ricky Pointing.,10
Lol Nadeem not like that boy. Stay still and whack whackity whack,8
"Goodbye, people of aar slash Cricket. I am going. Wish you a very happy Halloween.",4
CSK have won 6 Fairplay Awards,10
"People dance down the pitch, Nadeem dances across the pitch",10
"Bruh nadeem, stay calm",9
"Thala can show his displeasure over a decision, just like any other captain does. It's on the umpire to stand by his decision.",26
"I really loved dhoni until this moment, poor very poor",8
Captian calm is back after intimidating the umpire over a wide ball.,12
Idk why Dhoni gets so passionate only in CSK matches.,11
Just saying that ball earlier was deffo a wide,9
Dhoni basically threatened the umpire into not giving a wide in the last over,5
[deleted],-12
"I've seen keepers and bowlers try to influence the umpire all the time.

The onus is on the umpire and not the players. Can't blame MSD and the bowler. It was a wide and the umpire should have stuck to his guns",15
Why don't they give two batsmen out? Sunny talking like my dad with 2 drinks down lol.,7
Why is the batsman doing Kathakali on the crease?,6
Give the captaincy to kane and watch how both him Warner play better than this,11
"Unpopular opinion but the reason we‚Äôre in the bottom half of the table is Warner‚Äôs performance. Every year Warner is one of the best batsmen of the tournament. So far this year he‚Äôs not. 
 
Every other player is performing at about the same level as last year and 2018.",15
Ngl it seemed like a dot tbh. Idk what yall are on about,-5
Wow.... Bravo is nailing those Yorkers.,2
Now watch CSK top the fair play award table with this shit show going on,14
Man these guys will still top the Fairplay charts.,10
That's why I hate dhoni and csk too,-1
Dhoni reminded umpire of the script /s,15
Just don't bowl a fucking no ball,3
This was a doable chase. SRH fucked up in the middle overs,9
"gonna say it again, there‚Äôs only one tewatia this IPL",15
So Chennai has Big Show in squad?,3
"Go easy on Rashid he's not a batsman, he's a pinch hitter like Jofra Archer",10
"Nadeem: I do the salsa, I do the tango",2
Wtf bravo suddenly inform god level yorker specialist,6
3 sixes and a four. Let's go boys,2
Well that's game over,5
That was disappointing as hell. How tf do you not give it a wide,4
Will dhomi's shout end up in highlights? I missed it,8
[deleted],-4
I'll just remember this match for that wide,4
OMG the meltdown. Lmao,9
"What fault of Dhoni is there lol

Every player argues against Umpires decision. There are plenty of instances of Warner arguing against Umpire calling wides in this season alone.

Its uptown the Umpire to not be influenced by this.And this isnt some local Indian umpire either.",9
I think you all are grasping at straws for that wide. Even if it was given it wouldn't have made a difference. This game was lost in the powerplay.,1
Scenes if Rashid‚Äôs wicket was a no ball,15
Thala fans downvoting comments. Pfft,8
"Imagine being so desperate for a win that you now use your power to bully the umpire

Fuck this shit",-6
Csk haters gonna blame the whole match on that one wide,9
[deleted],13
Can bravo bowl out Khaleel? :3,5
Would love to see such passion from dhoni during India matches,9
[deleted],7
Who‚Äôs dick do you have to suck to bowl the last over? Guaranteed wickets every time,0
CSK does shit like this & then their fans get mad when people call them cheaters lol,1
Dhenier is a cheater,-6
"Lol, every team protests after a wide yorker is called a wide, blame the umpires, not the team for doing it. Umpire should not be so easily swayed.",22
"In b4 robelinda2 posts a ""Dhoni cheats"" YouTube video for that wide ball",1
cApTaIN c00l ! SMH,-10
Guys! Take a breath and think rationally! Every team players argue with umpires in the death and if the umpire chose to give wide it is on him. You can't blame the players for arguing which they tend to do due to adrenaline!,16
Come on Dhoni. Let the umpire know what he should signal.,12
"People in the comments reacting as if Dhoni has no right to show frustration.....

Not his fault the umpire did not give a wide!",25
Dhoni came onto the pitch to contest umpire decision and now shouted at umpire to change a decision. Time to take the stumps and ball and threaten to move out next time to complete the transition to gully cricket level.,11
Incredible bowling here from Bravo,5
Tewatia kicked us from playoffs and Csk is dragging us down with them.,23
Looking at Bairstow innings. Why does he either completely bottle it or perform really good?,6
Love how this sub fixates on the most inconsequential things,14
Amazing how Bravo can control the line till the very last instant of release.,17
2016 bravo would've definitely danced,9
Cheating super kings RIP,-12
"Srh needs to look on their middle order. nabi might be a good choice, but whom will you replace?",2
Everyone getting downvoted. Is this unusual for a GDT or par for the course?,1
After match the whole sub be like: Yes pretty sure CSK won the match solely coz of that one wide call. What a bullying team.,19
Will Bravo bowl a maiden here?,3
Butt unclenched,10
"Fuck off Dhoni, scumbag",-11
As if a wide was gonna change the result lol. People need to chill. The batsman also moved and the ball literally went above the meat of the bat.,11
Dhoni just ruining his image this IPL in every possible aspect,0
inhuman last over by Bravo damn,5
Thala supporters = serial downvoting confirmed?,-3
TIL appealing to the umpire for a decision is wrong. Blame the umpire for being fickle you fools.,11
Best finishing over? Seriously? Bowling to tail lmao slats,6
Imagine a captain appealing. How could he think of such a thing. Ban the fucker.,3
Yayy.  .. we wonnnüò≠üò≠üíÉüíÉüíÉ,5
"**19.3** Bravo to Nadeem, OUT, slower ball at a good length on leg stump. Looks for the slog and skies it up pitch side. Bravo yells mine and settles under that to take the catch and close any realistic mathematical chances for SRH **146-8**

S Nadeem c &amp; b Bravo 5 (5b 1x4 0x6) SR: 100.00",1
"""Friendship with nrr over now winning is my best friend""

-Dhoni, probably",30
"Anyone remember when Bravo bowled the last over to Yuvraj when India lost by a run, back in 2006? That broke India's streak of 17 consecutive successful chases (was a record back then, might still be the record).

Bravo was really good at bowling the slower ball. Also dismissed Sehwag on a slower ball in the same series",14
laude ka captain cool,-4
"whatever happens this is on Umpire, captain always tries to influence them. Poor umpiring continues.",16
"I don't comment on SRH v CSK matches as I love both teams. But not letting umpire call it wide was probably worse than last years onfield argument. I actually enjoyed that, but this I didn't like. Even if that was a wide they would have still won. I can't understand what prompted them to say it wasn't a wide.",8
Can't imagine the rejoice in this thread after DC beats CSK.,-2

Bravo making sure he plays the next match,15
bravo now Yorker specialist?,3

"Csk is back, giving heart-attacks to fans",16
Bwahahaha 1 run in the final over,12
Ambani and Srini mama's el cashico looks to be brewing,7
Who do CSK play next?,5
Why are we even surprised? This is the same guy who went into the field and had a lengthy conversation with the umpire just because a decision didn't go his team's way. Fairplay my ass,-3
"At this point people just want another reason to build (upon) their anger on Dhoni. Like that wide would've made *that* much a difference that it's worth Twitter and this thread going bollocks over it

And suddenly people care about Fair Play award? Lmao",25
Reactor meltdown countdown......Umpire sus,6
Serial downvoter can suck it,7
"Okay lmao hold up hold up. Why are you all questioning the entirety of dhoni? He is human, he thought its not a wide and reacted lmao. Have you all not seen players getting animated at umpires and the umpires still not changing the call? oh my god.Onus is on the umpire.He is captain cool but lmao dude is human. Heard someone say how lower can dhoni go. All he did was react lmao.",54
"BTW do you guys get so triggered when bowling teams appeal for every LBW that's clearly not a LBW too? No point in hating teams for doing it, International umpires shouldn't be so easily swayed.",22
Feeling bad for srh. Yall a good team,5
Aunty jeet gaye. Stop praying lol,7
SRH have checked out mentally from this season it seems,3
"After seeing that whole wideline fiasco I want DC and MI to absolutely *destroy* CSK, no mercy",-10
Gonna be honest folks dhoni didn‚Äôt make anyone do anything paul reifel isn‚Äôt a 10 year old,21
Srini mama smiles from the heavens...so long suckers,1
Lmao CSK will cross Royals on points table on >!NRR!<. How the turntables,7
"SRH losing , CSK winning ........ Let's all talk about that one wide


Let's also forget the wide that was given when Shardul bowled to JB


Let's also forget no wide given when Dhoni was batting",16
Dhoni bullying the umpire hurts the credibility of the tournament.  Makes IPL look like a farcical league where winning and losing are not decided fairly.,-11
Losers are the people who actually beleive Fair play award is actually FairüòÇ,11
The paati is the secret boiz.,13
"How to fix something in a team where you're unsure about what's broken! You think it's the bowling, you think it's the batting and at the end of the day, you end up failing in both.",10

YAYYYYYYYYYYYYYY,9
Anyone else think that wide decision was the Game Changing Moment of the Game?,-7

"Csk won by 19 runs, this should shut up 50% of the comments",13
"We won by 20 runs, decent comeback.",7
"Wow, I've never seen such a thing happen on a cricket field. Everyone blaming Dhoni, but that umpiring is so poor. Would rather he just blatantly make the wrong call instead of getting coerced into it.

These cunts are getting paid off I swear.",18
Sounds like crowd is chanting some satanic verses.,4
CSK Russell is out on the field. Man's living a dream life!,6
Half the sub is more intent on finding moments to shit on Dhenier than actually watching the match LMAO. He‚Äôs living rent free in your heads.,33
">	The umpire shall not adjudge a delivery as being a Wide, if the striker, by moving, either causes the ball to pass wide of him/her, as defined in 22.1.2 or        brings the ball sufficiently within reach to be able to hit it by means of a normal cricket stroke.

https://www.lords.org/mcc/the-laws-of-cricket/wide-ball

Calm down guys! Agree, the umpire shouldn't have changed his decision by listening to the players but that's his fault! Also it's not a wide. Rashid's bat was in the middle of the ball's path. He missed it!",2
Dhenier denied us a wide. Thanks to that cunt of an umpire.,15
Need to check N.Srinivasan‚Äôs bank transactions from last week.,10

"In hindsight they could and should have sent in 3D ahead of Garg. Has been in this kinda situation far more often and is a much, much better six-hitter. Nothing against Garg but his knock kinda has turned out to be the difference. You can't have a phase where you don't hit a single boundary for 6-7 overs.",1
"Every Keeper and Bowler try to act like it's not a wide but a brilliant delivery just inside. The Umpire should have given a wide, this is another shitty umpiring error this season",13

May be next time around send Rashid Khan as a pinch hitter at 4(kane at 3) and let Manish Pandey shepherd the middle order at the end. I am not sure anyone besides Kane and Rashid are worth retaining for SRH next year. Make Kane the captain and build with new team.",6
The last time CSK lost 5 out of their first 7 matches was in 2010 when they won the IPL lmao,13
I‚Äôm an RCB fan but if anyone thinks that CSK don‚Äôt have a great chance to qualify is kidding themselves. Wickets are getting slower and slower. This suits their spinners and trundlers,4
i rooted for srh till the end so this do be a sad moment,14
"WIN-LOSE IS SECONDARY. That was a Wide given by umpire, after which Dhoni & Shardul manipulated the umpires to change it, by fighting with him. That was a big disgraceful moment.",-6

As a neutral fan I picked csk to support because they started underdogs. But the first ball I watched their batsmen were playing with intent. I knew they are going to win. So much for underdogs! üòí,13
Wide scene here is pretty similar to bowling sides appealing for lbw on every ball that hits the pad. The decision rests on umpire and mind you paul reifel not your usual run of the mill umpire that can be influenced.,10

"SRH should've always gone with Shankar/Abhishek as the 5th bowler ploy and played 7 batsmen, from the very start of the season. That's out best bet. Even top teams have a weaker fifth bowler. DC have Stoinis and 3 of RCB's 5 are 5th bowlers. It's the indecisiveness of the management and captain, that'll make us lose the tournament. Warner isn't the kind of captain that can make 5 specialist bowler trick work. Even someone like Kane failed with the 5 bowlers trick in the final third of that glorious 2018 season. The issue with our team is the inability to stick to a combination and taking too long to take hard decisions. (In the 2018 season, they waited until the end to drop Manish Pandey. Which meant we were going into the Playoff without an experienced middle order.)",1

KKR who ran away with 2 wins from matches they should have lost is our competition for the 4th place in playoffs. But i imagine we will lose to Delhi and Mumbai for sure so our streak of playoffs every single season comes to an end,2

If you're so adamant of playing Kanos at No. 4, then why not give Garg a go at No. 3 where he's an absolute natural. They need to include 3D in the team. He's the only guy has that power in this team to clear the fence. Samad/Abhishek/Virat are needed to be rotated. Given the season is as good as gone, no harm in gambling with the youngsters. But they won't..",11

"As a non Indian I feel people here are missing the point.

An umpire of a match should not feel pressured or intimidated to not make a call. Yes it's on the umpire in that sense, but we should understand power dynamics as well.

Dhoni the isn't pant or ABD. In India it's pretty obvious to me he has huge influence. For me, this whole thing left a bad taste in my mouth.",8
 I am more than happy to be the villains of this league. Fuck everybody,30
"CSK supporters shouldn't be surprised why they're labelled as the most toxic fanbase in the IPL. It's person worshipping taken to a level where y'all can't admit anything Dhoni does as wrong and applying every sort of mental gymnastics to absolve him of any blame.

I used to love Dhoni when he represented us, but these last couple of years has really changed my perception of him. Walking on the field, arguing with umps just before he makes the decision is just not on and something Dhoni himself would have found wrong to do 10 years ago.",-17

SRH have shown that CSK is not even best test side,16
This wide nonsense is like KXIP complaining about the short run in our match. Basically be good enough to win the match without these moments is the answer!,5
"CSK looks better when its not chasing. Plus if Bravo could start to score few runs, batting would look better. Still its looking like the 1st season where they will miss play offs. I hope I am proved wrong. 

SRH looks listless. I dont like even Bairstow/Warner this year. Last year they were the most devastating opening pair. Only Kane and Rashid seem to eary their pay. Need a reboot of the team again for next auction.",8
"Lmfao people really out here acting like that one wide would've changed the course of the entire game , like they lost by 1 run not by 20 run. Name one person who wouldn't have been fired up in such an intense situation. Ffs I swear r/cricket is more of a Dhoni hate circlejerk at this point , I came to this thread expecting some critical analysis of today's match , people appreciating Thakur's bowling , Curran's batting , that absolutely phenomenal last over, but no , It's all just waahhhh dhoni bad he held a gun on the umpire's head and made him change the decision. What kind of umpire would let himself be influenced by some aggressive appealing and change his decision , then stop waiting for LBW decisions since all of those appeals are aggresive af.Ffs  


 I want to see CSK win this season just to see the salty people here who think themselves to be cricket Gods to meltdown  


Yes these incidents happen quite a lot and what happened was wrong but that one wide ball wouldn't have changed the freaking match , SRH was well short of CSK's performance and that's undeniable",34

Do people care about Rashid's feelings anymore? He was so heartbroken when umpire reverted his decision! Such a painful sight on the cricket field. He might forget how to bowl the doosra after this. Worst thing ever happening to a young man üòî Dhoni please stop hurting ‚úãüõë,23

"SRH has been bad consistently and the problem is we aren‚Äôt bad in the same areas consistently. We don‚Äôt know what exactly the problem is to rectify it, before we nail down on something there‚Äôs another problem rearing its head",12
So Srh did a Csk against Csk today. Nice.,18
"Think natarajan should bowl 3 overs in the death i.e 16th 18th &20th overs while Rashid should bowl the 15th over.khaleel should bowl 17th and 19th.Losing Bhuvi screws up the flexibility in the pace attack,his death bowling is more difficult to replace.Sandeep is doing fine in the powerplay and should bowl 4 consecutive or the 4th one in the middle overs.
Shankar was actually brought in place of samad for his bowling,then today nadeem was picked ahead of abhishek,nadeem is a proper and decent bowler so there is no need of Shankar's bowling.Srh shud stick with samad who is a good hitter of the ball,he should be the finisher for srh,shankar batting that low coming in place of samad and not bowling makes no sense.

Warner 
Bairstow
Manish 
Williamson
Garg
Samad
Rashid
Nadeem
Sandeep
Natarajan
Khaleel
I guess this is the most balanced team for srh and even garg is not a power hitter so I think srh shud experiment with garg opening along with Warner and use Bairstow as a finisher.Warner shud play aggressively instead of anchoring",3
"Inside part of Dhoni's stare is made up of a death threat and outside part is covered by some intimidation, so all he had to do is look at the umpire and the umpire reverses his decision.. That's the secret why he getting decisions in his favour. BCCI won't check this bcoz BCCI=Ganguly=Srini=Dhoni so don't respect them. SRH will win. CSK injured Bhuvi but their daddy Nadeem is back, they can't threaten him with death to get injured like they did to Bhuvi after the last match.",20
