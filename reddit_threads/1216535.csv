To make such an open statement about young players in itself is a shitty thing to do and people backing and supporting dhoni are ridiculous. A lot of players be young or old could be confidence players. You see someone like shikhar, he's a confidence player. As a captain, you're ideally supposed to at least have some trust in the players you fucking bought in an auction. They could be talented otherwise you wouldn't bid for them in first place. Give them enough chances and if they fail, you can talk whatever shit you want to about them. But making public remarks like that after not even a couple of innings might put so much pressure on the players and might destroy their confidence is ridiculous

Coming to twin ducks, honestly, facing Boult when ball is doing a bit is hard for some of the best batsman. We saw how our stars struggled against swinging Boult in WC semifinal.

He is really looking unsettled. He is overdoing the walking thing to force some intent, get some momentum, put the bowler off,..etc. This approach is clearly not helping him. 
When Dhoni came up to the stumps, he was forced to stay in the crease and started watching the ball and played on merit.
But he didn't learn from it, and went back to his previous approach the moment he had the opportunity and paid the price.
RCB should give him a break, and open with kohli with Moeen at 3.",10

This is more an Udana kinda wicket. Bowl cutters every ball.

It is really rare that both Kohli and AB hold back for so long after getting set, if the aim was for 180 one of them would have attacked from the 13th over or so like they usually do when we bat 1st. They must have thought 160 or so is a winning score and planned for that, only for both to get out with exploding.

Just need to find a good overseas seamer and decent Indian spinner and should be a good side for next season.
