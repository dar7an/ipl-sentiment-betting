"Come on CSK, win this one game please. Hope y'all learnt something about how to make a comeback from KKR yesterday. If both RCB and MI win today(which currently seems highly likely), we're gonna be quite fucked ngl.",0
I’d stick with the same team as the last for CSK. Except somehow try to play Sai Kishore maybe. Let Rituraj and Jagadeesan have another go.,5
Finch 101(56) today,5
[deleted],10
I hope it’s an OP meme match today so we can all have fun.,7
I hope Jadhav plays today. Missing his brute force defensive shots.,26
"Everybody is busy predicting who will win the match, but the real question who will Dhoni give his jersey today ?",17
"Are they playing on the same pitch that was used y'day in SRH/KXlP game? If yes, then the contest is equal. Tahir will have a blast.",14
The only way CSK is winning this is by playing 3 leggies and hoping that RCB management send ABD at 6.,12
Nothing against RCB but I think CSK is gonna win today. The bottom of the table team always messes it up for teams in the top 4 at the end of the tournament.,18
Lets gooo Unkillsss,4
Rcb should win so that I could see the mental breakdown of msd's chapri fans,8
"This game is giving me the vibes of the famous encounter in South Africa when RCB nearly bottled a chase of around 120 when they were cruising in the tournament

Good old days of Praveen and Dillon Du Preez swinging it in RCBs favor",9
[deleted],13
Hope Ab destroys the Csk bowling line up,26
[deleted],-2
Just gonna support CSK today. No need to thank me.,-9
I'm cautiously optimistic.,14
"Maybe I'm having high expectations, but I want this match to be entertaining... I'm sure RCB will fulfill that thanks to ABD, Koach and Lord Siraj, but then you have CSK... nuff said.",6
"RCB green has historically been entertaining matches, one way or the other",8
Why is star sports so obsessed with CSK. They aren't even showing anything about RCB.,7
Even though I should be supporting CSK but I wont. I don't want  DC to rely on other teams to do their job. So here to a hard faught match and hope for a close contest.,1
"Mandatory RCB vs CSK comment

Fuck IPL trophy, all I need is a win against CSK",11
RCB in green gives me good vibes even we have lost in green too still!,7
Why is star sports so cringe what bullshit apprentice and master,-1
My only hope is that RCB don't choke. I don't mind if CSK happens to  play well and they lose.,2
Shit I just realized UK time. Fuck me.,0
"RCB desperately need to get in the top two, if punjab makes it to the playoffs somehow, their stint ain't gonna end well if they are #3",18
"Star Sports pre-match shows are the epitome of cringe lmao. 

Also, just got to know a few days back that there is animated show on Star Sports about Virat called "" Super V "" where he is shown as a superhero.  Like,  seriously what the fuck, man !?!",10
"I lost a challenge yesterday and changed flair to KXIP from MI, can I still speak shit about KXIP?",-8
Monu Kumar is finally making a debut after 2 years and 11 matches this season,8
"Only good thing about IPL coming to end is we won't have to see cringe Thala Dhoni and CSK tributes videos on Star Sports. "" Will Thala dhoni fire today?"" Enough of this bullshit. Only two more CSK matches and cringe pre show to go after today 🤞",3
When is RJ Balaji returning to Tamil commentary? At least we can laugh while commiserating.,4
"Mahendra Bahubali and Super V in the same game. For the last time this season (yeah almost). 

All you sane cricket fanatics - Stay away from Star Sports preview shows today. May the force be with you, guys. Loads of love.",1
Virat chooses to air-fry CSK first,2
RCB bat,7
Monu Kumar’s spark plug will be tested today after being in the garage for more than 2 years.,12
crap. not another csk chase!,-3
We'll have a bat thanks,6
Finally Moeen!,3
Moeen in for Udana,2
RCB to molest CSK today,-5
No Udana,4
Moeen with a 5fer,5
Last night shouldn't be a factor considering SRH is light on batting. But then so is CSK so shouldn't matter,7
Should've bowled first,1
"gReAt iNiTiAtiVe

guess the other gReAt iNiTiAtiVe match",-3
Mo is in!!,1
lol dugout predicted santner inclusion last night!,5
Santer is in.. It's like they are setting teams based on social media comments.,21
Now this has to be RCB's best XI,0
Moen is a good change,7
"Kohli, please let us win the match if you are an admirer of Thala",4
"I'm not the biggest dhoni stan but seeing him like this defeated sad and almost given up makes me very very sad, I dont like seeing him like this.",65
"Happy with the team. Yeah season is over but atleast we are giving everyone a chance now .

Hopefully Gaikwad and Jagadeesan can play now without any pressure and make contributions.

Also going back to three spinners is nice . Used to be the CSK tradition since IPL started .

Hopefully we revert back to Curran (or Santner ) opening the batting and Faf can come in at 3.",6
Wait Monu is the same guy who Sakshi posted a photo with kissing his head?,22
"As a keralite, would have loved to see KM Asif back but I like Monu Singh too. Been waiting for 3 years and a pretty chilled out guy I've seen from the videos he's in. Think he's related to Dhoni's wife too",9
Mo will be a permanent fixture from here on. Good all-round abilities and a golden arm.,6
The Tahir-Santner partnership should be exciting. No one has gone with two foreign spinners this IPL iirc,8
Tahir and Santner to kill RCB,8
"CSK team( batting line up based on my hope )

Santner

Gaikwad

Faf

Jagadeesan 

Curran

Rayadu

Dhoni

Jadeja 

Chahar

Monu Singh

Tahir",3
So RCB bat till NO 8 and 6 proper bowlers. 12 over of spin. Should be a good one,47
That poetry was really nice :(,0
Moeen Ali finally IN. RCB squad getting further strong,11
"alright guys! First time since pandemic started I have a whole weekend to myself. Moved to hometown just before the March lockdown with my parents. WFH was beginning to take a toll. This is welcome break. I am ready with a blunt to watch this. Hoping CSK plays some exciting cricket, at the same time not keeping my hopes high. Though I am ^high",16
"Fantasy Q- who should i captain from DuPlessis, Curran, Buttler, SKY and Bumrah? Currently on Faf",2
I just love it when there are 10+ overs of spin. Innings gets over quickly.,11
So Finch and Maxi are playing all matches no matter what!,20
"Seriously when will rcb realise finch isn't gonna pull a Watson, quit while your ahead.",3
Is Dube dropped or injured?,0
[removed],-16
CSK might just win today,5
Guys! Finch is just fine. He is not giving any bad starts. Let’s not try to fix something that’s not broken.,8
[deleted],8
So lads which RCB's gonna show up today?? 49/10 or 263/5?,6
I really want the youngsters in CSK to perform well today and show their potential,4
Monu finally getting a game after being MS' chamcha (hanger-on) for so long,-11
"Few things in life are better than the extra hour of sleep you get the day the clocks go back

But watching RCB destroy the last slither of hope for CSK might be one of them",12
I really hope to see Tahir running around like a madman several times in this first innings.,-4
"I have this idea. To make the ending of IPL more entertaining,there should be a match between The team which won the ipl trophy in that season vs Playing XI consisting players of all the remaining teams. What do you think?",7
"I just have a bad feeling about this green jersey

I bet Tahir and Santner will pull some shit",7
CSK should buy Starlight from The Seven next season. She is a youngster with lots of spark.,12
"Thala preparing CSK for 2021 IPL. Since there'll be no mega auction, they'll need to figure out the best combination.",8
"Tahir 4-0-16-4

Santner 4-0-20-2",3
no Udana  we are putting too much trust on Siraj.,8
"Monu is a name that I can root for!

Let's go..",4
"RCB squad looks great, just that Dube needs to come in for Gurkeerat. Dube is an extremely good late game finisher and can bowl if needed as well. Gurkeerat is an anchor test match player, which honestly do we really need at number 5 in a T20 game?",9
Unrelated but I am so glad that srh lost yesterday. We don't fucking deserve to be in the playoffs because we are going to lose the eliminator anyway as we have done thrice now.,3
Can someone explain Why's dube being dropped even after decent performance? Gurkeerat isn't as good as dube also.,9
"I think, Gaikwad and Jagadeesan will continue to play the remaining matches. I hope they use this opportunity.

If not for pride, at least for upping their rates for next auction",9
Is the show Mirzapur worth watching ?,0
Moeen with a 10fer today,8
I think Dube should play instead of Mann.,8
SS Tamil trolling Kedar Jadhav by playing the clips of his batting misses.,15
Very smart of Kohli to drop Isuru Udana today. He knew that a Sri Lankan will definitely get thrashed on Dussehra.,104
"In the previous years, rcb would have been in csks and position and vice versa lmao",8
Kohli is using up all his coin toss luck instead of saving for aus tour ;-;,52
CSK will win easily today. Finch will waste 20 balls,-5
"The other day, just because Gaikwad and jagadeesan got out for a duck, MSD's toxic fans took to Twitter and said Dhoni can never be wrong and when he said he never saw the spark, that's true and you don't doubt thala.

To make such an open statement about young players in itself is a shitty thing to do and people backing and supporting dhoni are ridiculous. A lot of players be young or old could be confidence players. You see someone like shikhar, he's a confidence player. As a captain, you're ideally supposed to at least have some trust in the players you fucking bought in an auction. They could be talented otherwise you wouldn't bid for them in first place. Give them enough chances and if they fail, you can talk whatever shit you want to about them. But making public remarks like that after not even a couple of innings might put so much pressure on the players and might destroy their confidence is ridiculous

Coming to twin ducks, honestly, facing Boult when ball is doing a bit is hard for some of the best batsman. We saw how our stars struggled against swinging Boult in WC semifinal. No this is not comparing kohli to some youngster but boult is that good. If people want to suck on Dhoni's dick, no body is stopping them. But not at the expense of commenting on others while their entire team Shat the bed(including Dhoni) this season",8
Ah man. Udana was really good for RCB. I see no reason to replace him.,7
"Manu = Manchester United

Monu = Monchester United

Am I doing it right fellas?",7
Okay bois time to meme finch into form,21
The team which plays a lot of sweeps and lap shots for 1s and 2s on this slow pitch will win today. That means RCB are winning because Kohli will make a century without hitting a boundary with only 1s and 2s.,1
Finch's USP is his leadership.,5
Monu looks like my 50 yr old uncle,1
Did Sunny just say Jadeja has been disappointing with both Bat and Bowl?,5
"Should have bowl. You can end it first inning , why wait for second inning.",-2
Look at that avg age and send that to csk fans who say that they bring in many youngsters,0
Monu looks like discount Amit Shah,6
"RCB have bit of ""Bat Deep"" thing going today with Sundar at 8, can go hard right throughout the innings",3
Monu is that one creepy uncle we all are uncomfortable with,8
Monu looks like a tiktoker from Dharavi,5
search ipl on google and go to the match. prob is RCB 60- CSK 40 even before the match has started !,2
Off topic but do you think covid will completely vanish from india within 3 or 4 months?,2
"all the talk about csk being old, but rcb has an average age just 1 year less",6
Imma pull for CSK today,1
"Come on CSK, Show some fight!! Make my day a little better!!",2
Come on Finch!,2
"Damn Mo Ali is playing today, wanted to support CSK but ugh",4
Ain't nothin brings MS down 👍,2
CSK should also change their jersey a bit in 2022. Got a bit boring,4
Why did we choose to bat?????,3
"All of us are talking about either MI or dc being a strong, but this year rcb seems to be strongest their bowling is in top-notch form ,  batting may be little inexperienced but if finch finds form, they would be unbeatable .",1
"As a cricketer making his debut, I am more scared of Monu than either of Tahir or Santner",2
Get ready for painful first 10 balls from finchy,8
RCB's green is really good,3
Pitch tailor made for DP's 30(36),5
So we're playing against 11 highlighter pens today,5
"Don't depend on theory that pitch will slow down in the second innings, the same happened in the last RCB match vs KXIP and then there was Gayle storm.",2
"New player makes debut

r/cricket: lets make fun of how he looks bois",31
"Think every IPL been won by team that finished in top 2 since IPL format changed to playoff eliminators and qualifiers except SRH in 2016.

So finishing top 2 is massive for RCB. So would be nice if we could at least ruin that and have some positive from this train wreck of a season.",2
Will we get 150+ today?,1
Those red pads and gloves with the green jersey are such an eyesore.,17
Come on Finchy!! Would love to see you play your natural game today!,4
This green jersey RCB always reminds me of their game against GL. That was carnage,14
"RCB never lose in green jersey

Edit - Just checked they have won only one time in green. LOL",2
I have a feeling this will be a customary 250 score game with century by either abde or kohli. It invariably happens once every season .,1
They should've gone with the golden pads on this jersey.,7
RCB looks too strong on paper today. So it’s fair to assume RCB will lose this game.,12
Congrats RCB 2 free points for ya,3
"CSK fans: CSK have nothing to lose so they can win.

CSK: We have nothing to lose. So team proceeds to lose.",39
Hopefully CSK fielding should be better today with younger spark plugs,2
Aaron FLINCH  in the house...,3
"Love the green jersey wish they used it more, maybe during all day games.",4
Anyone know about Monu Kumar? Which state does he play for?,3
Do you dhoni will retire from ipl after this season?,5
I have a feeling CSK will win today.,2
Chahar bowling to finch. This isn't going to end well,9
Finchy scores more with his butts than his bat,8
Prediction : Santner will bowl the second over and open the batting,5
Will Finch end up in a new team next IPL?,5
"As a mi fan, it's weird supporting csk",6
The green RCB jersey reminds me of some chaos I witnessed a few years back. Hope that happens again,8
There has always been something missing from finch’s game which prevents him from going to that next level of elite batsmen .,8
CSK groomed Chahar as a youngster,11
Couldn't they buy an extra set of 11 pads,8
[deleted],10
Finchy being finchy,3
Finch 70+ today. You heard it here.,9
Lol i thought it was a catch,8
Dev should’ve come for 3rd ffs,6
"Bruhh whatever finch scores
I'll take it as a bonus runs!!!",21
How is a world class player like Finch so afraid of swing?,13
Man finch lives on the edge. Maybe it's just me,14
Praveen Kumar flashbacks,7
Finch to make a century,9
Santner should bowl next over,5
Google was giving 60% win probability for RCB before the start of match. How does this even work?,9
"If Finch actually finds forms, everyone else is truly fucked",50
Finch not wasting balls!,4
Finch's quota is over,7
I hope these boundaries will make him realise he is a pretty good batsman even against swing and doesn't need those ramp walks,27
Forced Finch to smash couldn't defend now coming ahead in pitch,7
Finchy playing with fire & I love it!!,11
Green day Finch day...,11
RCB fans be thankful we gonna bring finch back to form.,17
Are we going to finally get a Finch show today?,6
Great! Power went out.,8

"MI folks, finch for lynn, deal?",5
RCB is going to be bowled out for 48. you heard it here first. thank me later.,-10
I don't get why do so many f\*\*king batsmen like Bairstow and Finch open when they can't even face a swinging ball?,11
Dugout is really insightful,5
Desi Lyon coming to bowl,75

Monu looks like Joginder Sharma without hair.,11
Bruh minion Monu,8
"That arm must be quite near to the 15 degree bend, no?",7
Monu is *sparky*,4
It's weird seeing a fast bowler bowl with full sleeves,5
Want Abde to come in early and hit a 45 ball 130 . Please one time .,4

How did Finch open for Australia with this technique is out of me,12
finch just hit a six and get out,5
Monu doesn’t look like IPL quality tbh.,12

This is the longest over ever,11
"Can't see match rn. How it's looking and what's csk squad?


Edit : MONU IS PLAYING!",8
Green kits with red pads is quite the look,11
So confused...why is Nathan Lyon bowling pace with Sreesanth's action ?,49
Pretty sure at the start of season nobody in CSK camp would have thought that Monu is going to get a game.. probably not even Monu himself.,11
Even that would have been a wide lol,8
"Unlike Sharapova, those grunts by Monu do hardly any good to his delivery. Ugh.",14
Finch should just stay inside the crease and swing. He's so powerful,5
not what I expected a guy called monu would look like,11

He is really looking unsettled. He is overdoing the walking thing to force some intent, get some momentum, put the bowler off,..etc. This approach is clearly not helping him. 
When Dhoni came up to the stumps, he was forced to stay in the crease and started watching the ball and played on merit.
But he didn't learn from it, and went back to his previous approach the moment he had the opportunity and paid the price.
RCB should give him a break, and open with kohli with Moeen at 3.",10

"If Dugout can do this type of analysis on a single player, imagine the analytics team of the franchises, wonder what gold they would have on every player.",16
"6D chess from ABD to get 42 year old tahir to chase that, now he's too tired to bowl well",19
This season hasn't yet seen a Jadeja masterclass in the field where he just ruins the opposition's batting with an out of the world catch or a direct throw.,11
"Hotstar showing an ad about the CSK documentary, Roar of the lion, in which Dhoni says 'I always say what doesn't kill you makes you stronger' like he came up with it",22
Finch even if he makes fuck all for the rest of the games will not get dropped. So stop whining.,9
"Wtf are those goggles, Sam?",10
Cheeku having kela in timeout nice,7
Monu kumar will be the new shivil kaushik today.,3

Sam with that CURRENT,4
Curran flashes and flashes hard!,4
Dussehra Mela goggles for Sammy boi!,8
Curran looking fly,6
"RCB can really just knock it around tbh. With Moeen to come in later, and with CSK's 'death bowling', can see some fireworks later",5
Curran looks ready for a pool party,7
Who was that Ahaaa guy.. xD,3
"LMAO SAM!

WHAT ARE THOOOSE",6
Curran reminding his boomer teammates about his age with those green shades,11
Sam also wants to save the planet,10
Sam wtf lol,2
Those sunglasses look goofy lol,4
Why is Sam Curran wearing RCBs shades,4
Kohli always finds singles,5
Australians having a bad ipl even though they were match prepared,2
Swanny taking on Curran for those glasses LMFAO.,2
Did Curran get that from Swaminathan by the Chennai beach for 20 rupees,3
Unpopular Opinion- Comparing women on the basis of how good they look is not cool. Lets limit ourselves to cricket eh?,6
"Sam Curran with the Fuckboi goggles 

Probably a cougar gifted it",9

Man Bangar is good.,1
Tahir will run out of the stadium if he gets these two.,3

"The field is preventing the second run frequently, smart",0
Do yall reckon Siraj will carry his form or will he go back to his old ways,0
Inb4 kohli 43(39) and abd 103*(45),9
Rcb in the middle overs is really slow,7
May I ask why Dube isn't playing? He's a much better hitter than Gurkeerat and can bowl 1-2 overs if needed.,4
Don't take chances with jaddu Bois,7
"Close shave dayum, was Jaddu",5
Kohli has sacrificed a death bowler in Udana (still don’t trust Siraj based on one good match) and yet Finch hasn’t delivered. He doesn’t deserve such a long rope. Udana and Moeen should both play,4
"Don't risk those runs, please.",5
Swann smoked some good shit today.,11
Jaddu missing this is sad,7
Hoping that Tahir will play for CSK in 2021 too.,10
Rcb has the lowest run rate this season between 8 to 15 overs,8
Sam's the imposter,7
"One thing distinctly missing this season is batsmen rarely use their feet to spinners. Even top batsmen. 

Everyone's sitting back and either waiting for the ball to be overpitched and range hitting like Samson or waiting for it to be dropped short which is tricky in the big boundaries at Dubai and Abu Dhabi. 

Even domestic Indian batsmen don't play spin as well as before.",4
160 target should seal the game for RCB,3
Man even now I'm having heart attacks.,8
These two are looking good,5
"De Villiers don't go for a quick single. 

We will be happy to see tuk tuk on the other end rather than you getting run out.",7
When you realize Monu still has 3 overs left,7
"This is going exactly like last match. Kohli taking quick singles and doubles, while the fielders are running in the sun and getting tired.


Kohli is going to accelerate soon.",8
Why did RCB suddenly decide green today?,0
I sense a carnage if these 2 don't get out. :),2
Tahir's hairs looked grayer than usual the other day as if his mehdi guy can't visit him due to social distancing norms,3
Curran with his 80's disco/porn glasses looking cool,8
Some real tactical stuff from MS. Nice to see an unorthodox field.,5
I say bring Monu. They'll do something And we might get a wicket here.,2
When will FInch get dropped? Even Shane Watson was dropped. They have yoing Phillipe to replace him.,3
CSK is lacking *spark* in their fielding.,5
Lenskart ads are hilarious,3
"""Shot. Four. de Villiers!""",5
Mo gonna bat with 2 bats lol,1
Anyone knows the name of the girl in the Airtel X tream ad?,-1
What is RCB’s plan to win the cup? Kohli+ABDV each score 70+ in 2-3 playoff games or they go home?,3
"A boundary an over when available, else take singles or twos till the 14th over or so has pretty much the MO of these two for years now.",6
This is the ideal T20 middle innings right? 4-5 singles and a four!,2
Strike rotation porn,7
"Banton would have been a great backup option for finch instead of philippe..

banton also a wk and explosive openor+ right handed so the left hand(paddikal) right hand(banton) combination stays...

if kkr does not retain banton then rcb is gonna go for him next year.",3
Monu has 3 overs remaining with ABd and Kohli set. Lol have fun chasing 200+,8
This is the first rcb match i am not watching live :-(,6
Absolute scenes when monu gets both of these out,5
Unpopular opinion: RCB should play with 3 overseas and bring PP in. PP to go berserk and if he gets out no problem because it brings in VK early,9
Kohli stop please.,3
Why do you have to change from helmet to cap for spinners and pace.,2
Red Pads with Green outfit is interesting,3
"I heard that Gaikwad was very aggressive, but seeing his last match, he could barely connect the ball. I also heard he contracted corona along with chahar. What's the chance that impacted his performance permanently? Genuine q",7
How much is Dhoni paid?,4
Black Cocks,10
Hurry up and get out Chutiyas so I can watch the glorious beard,3
Sam Curran doing his sunglasses shopping from HeraPheri's Akshay kumar,9
Hope Moeen doesn't do a Scotty,11
Dugout is talking about the New Zealand Black Cocks,9
I'm so tired of commentators jerking off to ABD and VK,1
Is KP no longer commentating? I do not see them around these days,2
"A very good spell.from Santner, we should have got him earlier",3
Proper cringe commentary this.,2
Survived Santner. Phew,2
In last match RCB was 95 in 15 over still made 175 without abd,2
Black cocks,2
Wow the overs are just flying.,2
Monu my boy where are you :(,3
"CSK

Throws: 38263881719387
Throws on wicket: 1",2
Black Cocks is the answer,1
"New Zealand chose ""Black Cocks"" as a nickname for their badminton national teams

Cheeky Swanny",5
Why no green pads?,2
"Fuck!! Kohli can't bat against leg spinners these days.

I blame Zampa.",1
"Finchy is getting it way too complicated with the walking up to the bowler early on. 

If he can get hit in the dick every match he’ll score a 50 every time. Easy  stuff.",2
The scale of the jio csk ad is so bad. All of them look like midgets on the balcony.,2
Jaddu vs Santner to see who finished their overs more quickly,1
"As a saffer, watching AB score runs off Tahir is like watching your parents through a messy divorce. I want them both to succeed always don't make me choose!",6
The overs are passing by in a hurry. Just imagine Jadeja coming on here.,2
Man this pitch has no pace left in it. Anything above 160 should be a competitive score imo,5
"So Jaddu, Santner and Tahir are all in. Left it all to Sam Curran to handle pace AND carry the batting, have you kings??",3
You are now witnessing the famous RCB tuk tuk.,12
Kohli still 0 boundaries,2
"SRH couldn't chase 120 yesterday after scoring 56 in the power play.

Considering we generally score around 25 in the power play 100 is probably the max we could chase .",3
Spin yorker,2
Good that at least we are chasing today instead of batting first to score 130/6,5
Yorker!!,1
Would you rather Monu or Jadeja bowl the 3 overs that CSK needs?,4
Dhoni is much more pleasant and encouraging of his players in this game.  He looked like an angry mean old man in some of the previous outings.,4
I was promised a Tahir running spree... Where is it?,4

What's wrong with Santner? He is a gun fielder usually.,3
Teenage level fielding,1
Double missfields!!,0
So many events in this Ball,3
The fuck was that passage of play,3
That's what these two do to fielders.,3
Santner quietly finished his quota giving less than run a ball. Dude is underrated.,8
RCB are the slowest scoring team in the 7-15 over period.,8
The pitch is slow. Very slow.,4
Yikes such bad fielding,7
six different angles lmao graeme,3
Wtf is this outfield that was hit so hard,5
Dhoni keeping Monu sir for death overs as he doesn't want to see his mate Kohli trembling and sweating.,4
Dhoni contemplating to retire after all these miss fields,0
Lol they’re saying “brilliant” stop... gtfo of here,7
Santner does have a hunchback damn,7
Santner quota over so early woah,6
Hits his thumb,5
I fucking love dugout man,11
I watch Dugout everyday to hear Swanny take the piss out of the third umpire.,20
God just give a four dont want 200 replays to decide it's not a 4,13
This is why CSK is at the bottom,1
"That was 4, dafuq",12
Swann doesn't give a f 😂😂,11
All the dugout comms getting on the Swann bandwagon.,6
Please someone get one of these out,1
Is there a r/yesnoyesnonononoyesno?Yes ?,4
"Anytime Kolhi-AB, Anytime now",2
"Even at the age of 41, Tahir is bowling brilliantly",7
Don't have dugout on my channel. What did the swann guy say?,2

These two are gonna go crazy after Tahir finishes his spell,3
"Murugan Ashwin bowled brilliantly yesterday, was it the same pitch?",3
Faf used to bowl leggies too right?,1
Swann has made dugout better.  I'm sure he brought some new audience to the broadcast as well,3
RCB's homage to the last great living legend of the game,5

how tf am i supposed to hear that? any specific channel??",7
"Masterful

Ominous

Number 1

Ultra-Cool",3
Everytime Kohli gets out all I have on my mind is “GOTTA GO GOTTA GO GOTTA GO”.,2
I think IPL should have a yoyo test to maintain standards comparable to international cricket. CSK is fielding like it's a charity game.,2
"Swann has been so caustic at times. Bless the man, bloody funny.",3
Another drop,8
Jaddus hairline is....something else,2
No one wants Kohli to get out,4
"Jadeja gonna bowl at the death today.

This is gonna be fun",5
What SRH did wrong last night was not getting this 1's and 2's regularly like Virat and AB.,9
Dunno who it was that predicted like 85-2 after 13 overs but they're looking pretty Nostradamus-esque atm,13
We are seriously out of luck!!,2
How many catches CSK want to drop before it stops being funny?,7
Is 150-160 enough in this pitch?,5
What are these field placements brooo,9
What even is CSk fielding this season?,7
Cmon vk get a move on please,7
"How to beat rcb:

Step 1: expect finch to play like finch

Step 2: keep DDP and kohli till the 16th over

Step 3: send ur strike bowler to abd when he feels rr pressure

There u go, rcb below 160 score",20
Jaddu needs a barber,5
CSK needs an astrologer to get some luck going their way. Maybe go for RPSG Goenka’s astrologer.,11
Did they seriously play Monu to give him one over?,14
Dropped catches don't go well with CSK.,20
AB getting his golf swings out anytime now,21
Don't feel bad RCB there's Monu Kumar at the death,12
Ah. Got reminded of all the drops off Dhawan. So nostalgic!,11
Rooting for Jaggi and Rutu to come good for MS and Fleming. They'd love some positivity even if they lose today!,9
"Kohli and abd really need to start going, they still have Gurkeerat, moeen and Morris left.",6
Bring monu back,3
"Play youngester. Give him one over. 
Peak csk.",1
Dhoni wishing he had picked 3 more spinners today.,6
"One way or the other, CSK should’ve made place for Tahir from the start. Spinners have thrived in the UAE",9
"~~Sonu~~ Monu, Tujha Majhyavar Bharosa Nay Kay",7
Last 18 balls no boundary.,7
Bowl Lyon you cowards,2
"Is it just me, or ABD is louder than other players? Hearing his calls every other ball..",2
I think Dhoni forgot that we don't have a death bowling in place.,6
I think the dugout feed is owned by star sports while official feed is owned by BCCI,4
CSK made team for these slow ass tracks. Imagine 7 games here.,4
Tf. I thiught that brown  hat fielder's full body was outlined with blue,1
"Kohli and ABD be like so CSK fam we have been told by mike to show a special demonstration on how to run doubles and singles, so here we go",2
BRB watching mi vs kxip highlights from last week,4
Every game I watch it and every game I am convinced at running between the wickets Kohli is currently unparalled in world cricket.,5
Kohli/ABD partnership has lost some of the oomph it had in previous seasons.,0
Fucking cunted that.,2
"Sam Curran will obviously bowl a couple at the death.

But for the other two death overs our options today are 

Jadeja 

Chahar

Monu Singh

If AB stays till the death can see them two overs going for atleast 50 min",2
Kohli gonna tuk tuk till the 20th over without getting out,1
What a shot by Ab,2
Shot AB,2
"So it’s going to be Monu at the death 

Yayyyyyy",3
Yes Tahir deserved wayyy more games,1
kohli be like why take 2 single when dot and double do trick,8
Monu can be our Shivil Kaushik today.,6
I am one day late to ask this. Why didn't Shaw play yesterday? Dropped or injured?,0
"Oh, what a timing.. even faf couldn't reach that",5
"24(26)

24(22)

That was a good phase for us.",10
Here we go it’s starting,8
AB is going to pump Monu and Chahar at the death. CSK need to get him in the next 2 overs.,12
Is the ground slippery?,2
Monu shonu looking so chotu,10
 Bruh moment by Monu there,5
Aight my Morroco Pasta Pizza is here wish me luck,15
It will be bad if any of these set batsmen lose their wicket.,1
No boundaries yet for Kohli.,-3

What a shot Koach,3
Fasten your seatbelts boiis! Here we go!,4
"Oh man, Dhoni folding his hands and waiting for the Ball to come back while watching even the young fielders mess up things lol!",8
Inb4 one of these guys get out and people start calling for them to be dropped.,20
First boundary for Kohli,4
Did he hit it between the legs?,5
are these guys expecting csk to bat like how they did last game?,1
Why isn't csk realizing these people will start picking up runs soon and not just singles forever?,7
83 in the last 6 with Moeen and Morris to come is do-able,6
The rampage is gonna start anytime now,12
150 is par here so RCB is batting sensibly.,8
Tahir better not lay his hand trying to stop that ball.,9
Not many players can take 4 on that ball,9
150 is the target I'm guessing,2
No Tahir wicket today! Ffs 2020,19
Tf is BKT,4
I have a feeling Jaddu might go for plenty,2
Monu is a tiny boi.,8
Can anyone explain why tf is kohli called KOACH,5
"Ez win for Rcb, they're gonna get 170+",1
Ab needs to play out this over. Then it's absolute carnage,6
still csk match to lose. They have the momentum just need to apply the choke,1
"VK, AB there is something called onside also",4
"Who is going to get Dhoni's jersey today?
Maybe padikkal",10
"Still feel RCB need an  attacking Batsman down the order in Dube, not Mann

Sundar is there to steady the ship",9
Need atleast 160,4
Chahar and Curran have 2 overs both.,5
Ooof play this over out please.,-1
"World's best batsmen playing at run-a-ball batting first.
Going to horrible watching Jaggi and Rayudu in the Middle overs all over again!",2
He was nowhere near lmao,3
We need one more Monu over please,4
we have moeen and morris left lads,8
"Sunil ""Flights are about to take off"" Gavaskar.",10
149,6
Someone should make a post about why kohli is called koach and pin it in the sub.,14
Lol sunny G,7
I’m cringing for Gavaskar because he’s already repeatedly predicted ‘flights taking off’ every ball but it hasn’t happened yet,7
Kya slow khel rahe hain yaar,0

65 million years. Zap",19
wtf virat,1
You know the wicket is slow when ABD is batting at a strike rate of 100. I'll take anything above 160 at this point really..,13
Monu will get both of them.,1
160 realistically,4
"Sam Currans shades are some of the most horrific I've ever seen, fair play",5

2 dots, and 4 singles.

Plenty of hot singles in the area.,13
"Never watched Sunny G bat, but I have zero respect for him as a commentator",-2
130 would be a difficult target for csk. xD,-1
Lyon to bowl,3
I’m scared for CSK if ABD and VK are struggling to hit big shots,3
Monu looks like that Shel silverstein dude from the Wimpy Kid books lol,3

Jadeja finishes an over by the time I pee and get back smh,2
This monu guy looks like Nathan Lyon,2
MONU LETS GO,6

Carnage starts.,1
Why is Lyon playing from CSK?,3
It's time. Release the KRAKEN....,1

Unpopular opinion: Moeen Ali shoud played at 4 he has the highest strike rate in middle overs since his debut in 2018.,1
Garry’s back let’s go.,1
Big over alert 🤣,0
What is wrong with these RCB fans? 126 was defended here yesterday... Chill out,4
Fuck yes death bowler Monu,3

people are predicting 160? no way. 140 at best,-1
"Last csk vs rcb RCB at 15 -95 -> 20-178

This match 15-99 ->20-??",2
Ooh he’s from Jharkhand,2
Mighty over incoming,2
Wow he is like five feet tall,0
"Let's go buddy!!

Whole CSK is with you.",1
From when did Lyon started bowling fast,2
Who tf wants an interview now.,2
Jadeja and Santner have bowled 36 balls and Moeen has faced 0 of them. Can’t help but feel this is an error from RCB and overcompensation for their mistake vs KXIP,2
Katappa back into attack,3
We all woke up today for Monu v ABD,6
Is this yesterday nights pitch?,2
Monu is a nice name,7
[deleted],7
 Moeen Ali and monu kumar are katappas of this match.,7
Lemskart should sponsor a misfield of the season and show the worst misfield as ad till next IPL so as to shame the misfielder. Better incentive than catch of the season to field good.,11
this is now more like Chennai pitch and conditions.,3
The GOAT for all GOATs: Monu Singh,2
In b4 Monu gets Lord status,4
Chad Koach vs Virgin Monu who wins?,1
Gavaskar keeps predicting boundaries but wasn't he here just yesterday for the other game. The wicket is hard to bat on,0
I feel bad for any ragging Monu might’ve faced in his life,14
Virat shivering seeing the real GOAT,9
Bachchan is selling this Dubai thing real hard... think he has a stall there?,4
Definitely don't wanna run into Monu in a dark alley,7
I don't get why Santner has hardly played. Decent bowler and would have improved the lower order batting.,2
"Man I can't watch Monu vs AB and Virat. Please boys, he's a kid!",4
Monu Kumar is a new face so I guess Kohli will reckon giving away his wicket to him.,11
How old is Monu san ?,1
BREAKING: local man with poor knowledge of the pitch has strong opinions about the run rate,10

It isn’t a Monu over without an obscene wide,11
Monu looks like Birju from CID. The guy who always spills out the plan after 1 slap from Daya,8
Bowling coach thinks he is very accurate. And he bowled two wides down the leg side in the first over.,2
Monu Kumar will be perfect in a Roadies sketch by TVF,5
"Just had a look at Monu's shoes...message ""fuck it,bowl fast""",3

Koach looks frustrated!!,2
"Kohli will hit him for 3 consecutive 4s, and then will get lbw to monu",2
No ball,1
CSK literally picked Monu because of his height. Or lack there of. LMAO,3
The pitch is clearly tough to score. Calm down mofos,4
RIP Monu,0
Freee hitttttt,1
No way do CSK's youngsters give old vibes. It's in the DNA.,3

This is gonna cost him now,1
Free hit to ABD,1

Oh no Monu!! What you do?,2
Erm constantly commentators talking about Monu's height is kinda getting old rather quick.,8
"Monu out here looking like Indian Nathan Lyon, and the yellow doesn't help either",8

This pitch is fucked if ABD is struggling for timing.,8
Can already see Saini getting tonked everywhere,10
You think Monu looks like Lyon? Give that guy a longer beard and Curran's sunglasses and you see a Hashim Amla,11
Can't believe this is Kohli AB Partnership. I'm expecting utter carnage in the last 4,10

Binging with Babish is quite a handy bowler I see,15

Looks like Monu likes to bowl 9 balls per over on the regular,17
lord jadhav blessed RCB,6
"Sry lads, doesn't look like a 249 to me today",19
"Minus bowling a lot on the pads, otherwise he's accurate",10
"It was a very good over, the figures might suggest otherwise but has bowled pretty well",17
Fielding is agricultural,6
Is the pitch thaaat bad or what,8
RCB inspired by yesterday's DC chase? Or Dubai pitch did full 360? From 200 plus scores to 150?,10
AbD with a SR less than 120 😨,7
Need 60-70 in the last 4,6
"If bowling doesn't work out for Monu, my man has a solid career in acting as the minion of the villain in South Indian movies.",9
"Okay, officially too many for CSK. RCB can declare now. XD",9
From a cricket perspective- commentators always talk about the weird angle the ball reaches batsmen when Holder bowls. I wonder how it is when the ball comes from Monu Kumar,4
WTF when did the match start?,2
CSK batting gonna struggle in this pitch,6
"RCB will easily score 170

We will limp to 130 max 

Just a repeat of the reverse match",7
"Boys, playing against CSK does not mean we have to play like CSK.",9
"RCB can get to 150+, which should be enough.",4
Faf and Curran are just going to bitch slap Saini and Siraj aren't they?,0
Lol only one boundary and it's a 13 run over.,3
Don't judge the pitch by Kohli's batting.,5
The only way is up for Monu dada. He can improve everything about his bowling.,4
Unfortunately installing new spark plugs didn’t improve CSK’s fielding. It’s still shit.,7
Seems like some people in this thread didn't see yesterday's game on this pitch. It's slow.,7
Why does monu bowl leg side?? Some good balls in the over and then this on the leg side.,3

140-150 wins them this game on this pitch imo,7
"Monu bowled an 8 ball over including a no ball that only went for 13 lol

9 off the first 7 balls as well",9
"ok RCB. do the right thing, declare now.",21
Just tuned in but why is Megamind bowling for us lol,13
[deleted],3
We couldn't even score 120 in sharjah.we are gonna get fucked here,4
Monu should play the next game as well. Just shield him from De Villiers and Kohli in the last 4!,5
CSK Fans trying to reverse jinx RCB,2
Htf RCB has lowest Rr in middle overs not csk,4
The low run rate during 7-15 overs is really scary and I feel it may cost us real bad one day for sure,1
we should use morris like narine,3
"Around 240 runs last night, same used pitch on a day game. It'll probably be low scoring",3
Over rate  ⬆️,4
114 now. I guess that will be enough. Anything more is bonus now,8
Rcb will get to 160. CSK won’t reach there in even two innings,3
The runs synchronization of kohli and abd is cool😅,10
Monu = bald Rajat Bhatia?,5
I hate these pepperfry ads with a vengeance,3
CSK will lose by 100 runs today.,-1
"People moaning about the slow scoring rate; bear in mind this is AB and Kohli who are finding it hard to hit boundaries all over the place, after having been in on this pitch for 10 overs. That should give an indication of how this pitch is.",18
Why does ABD look tired,6
Fuck I'm already feeling sleepy imagining CSK's innings on this shit pitch,5
Is Monu Kumar relative of Dhoni?,4

Oh no,4
Hitting Jadeja like he suddenly remembered Jadeja's run out in Sachin's 175 innings against Australia on 5th November 2009 at Hyderabad,8
Am I the only one who likes this green+red combination?,9
What the fuck is that on monu's wikipedia page,5
Every time koach steps out of the crease my heart beat drops to zero,1
"These pitches are getting slow asf lol.

"Guess another player who keeps the towel in front while batting. Has similar style of play. Coincidence, I think not.",2
"If this pitch really is as bad as it looks, anything above 145 should suffice",3

Curran won’t be bowled out. Wow,11
That Keo Karpin girl looks creepy af,0
this is literally thst chepauk pitch in chennai. A landmine and a spinner paradise. Csk usually excel at these kinds of shit pitches. Dhoni blasted a 224 against australia in this type of pitch,11

UGHHHHHHHHHHHH,1
"**Ball is in air**

Is the pitch so difficult? They couldn't really accelerate.,5
Chiku needs to improvise,1
Come on. Send in Morris.,1

Can't believe ABD's strike rate is so slow,5
"Fucking hell lads,

Monu Singh probably got bullied for his hairline and bowling style alot yet he now shares a dressing room with legends like Fleming Dhoni,Faf,Watto,Bravo, Raina, Jadeja and Bhajji.",13
If we can restrict them to 145 we can win this,6
RCB already crossed the chaseable score by CSK... So no worries,6

Holy crap India top 4 are all top scorers this IPL. Brohit is the only one who hasn't performed/,3
Faf caught a ball without doing circus near the boundary rope.,7
150 looks difficult now,4
A pitch like this is even worse than those flat ones. Low scoring games are only fun when the ball is doing something,5
126 got defended here. CSK has worse batting than SRH and RCB has 2 quality spinners + Moeen. 150+ should do it.,7
This might be a good chance for a run-out as Koach might forget he doesn't have ABD at the other end.,1
In b4 Moeen Ali does what he did last year to Kuldeep,2
155 please.,8
what a shitty pitch,5
Unfortunately for CSK they don’t have strike rotaters but only dot ball consumers in the team. Winning probability too low on this shit pitch.,12
Moeen with that extra shield with the beard,2
Shouldnt rcb have attacked earlier? Like couple of overs ago?,2
You guys think AB and Kane belong to the same level?,-5
Who's Santner in for?,1
Moeen and Tahir both criminally underplayed this IPL,7
Moeen should hide the ball in his beard in the run up and just castle the batsman really,3
Sensing a God Innings from Koach,4
"If Curran doesn't bowl this over, Imma head out.",2
Morris is better slogger than moeen ali. Is that too hard to understand for rcb management,1
"Not getting to 150 is criminal, with so many wickets in hand",2
Looks like Moeen is gonna run a lot of 2s,2
Did csk play on this pitch before?,7
YOUR BEST BATSMAN SHOULD FACE MOST BALLS merchants in mud.,14
Moeen has had a terrible year with the bat.,6
Damn! How fit is Kohli! Been there for like 15 overs in the heat and still running the 2s,19

Ok Morris now Koach ffs Morris please,7
Wtf was that moeen?,2
"What's gonna happen now 😢

Please King. Take us over the line",5
So hard to get any real power on this pitch,1
Random suggestion... Play moeen at top in place of finch... He has opened the innings for England and maybe use finch as a all out pinch hitting  finisher,5
RCB doing RCB things,1

Moeen ali is better suited at top ... Benefitting from powerplay ...,7
Pls send Morris,8
"Lads, stop trying to launch straight. I've seen one six in the two innings I've seen on this pitch, and like five guys getting caught.",6
Give strike to koach ffs.,1
BETRAYED BY KATTAPPA,2

Catching practice lol casual as you like,2
This is my kind of pitch,1
"**18.1** Curran to Ali, OUT,  **132-4**

MM Ali c Santner b Curran 1 (2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50.00",2
Better be Morris now,2
It appears Virat think anything around 160 will be a solid score on this pitch. I don't see any other reason why ABD or Virat doesn't start hitting early on.,4
Send Morris,1

Where is my boy gurrrrrkeeerattman?,2

I like this. This is a nice contest between bat and ball. I don't want to see a 180+ run fest everytime,3
"*Moen after facing two balls

All right imma head out",4
CSK should just clone Sam Curran somehow and play 11 of him.,11
That's a ridiculously harsh wide,7
Pollard falling over that advertisement board is funny ngl,4
Another Koach fast running masterclass?,7
4d chess by csk to use Jadhav to possess opposition and win the match. Thala masterstroke™,5
So Koach isn't that bad captain either happy to see Morris lol,4
I thought bappi da's cred ad was awesome but Udit and Alka killed it. Especially the rap part at the end,7
"Moeen Ali did the right thing. 12 balls to go, Morris and Washy in the shed. No point taking singles or playing cautiously.",14
Dhoni stare didn’t work 😜,1
"Kohli needs to take strike to get them to 145 ish. A new batsmen, especially someone without finesse like Morris will struggle",7
Seems like RCB management is on this thread.,2
"Ball hits the bat

Kohli: Two Two, motherfucker",12
Not too worried about the Moeen wicket tbh; just highlights that you can't just come in and smash it on this pitch.,8
Where is my test match gang or is it only reserved for CSK??,3
CSK should easily win this.... if Mike Hussey and Suresh Raina play well today,11
Csk will believe they can chase this. Just need one guy to stand up.,4
Safe to say CSK are absolutely fucked on this pitch,7
Kohli vs Curran: We know how this is going to end,1

"I have been feeling from well before this match that cheeku might just want to not win this game seeing how low his good friend mahi has been all IPL. Not calling it fixed at all, just saying he'd be feeling really bad.

I want photo of Morris and Monu together,3
"I actually think this is a pretty good score on this pitch. 

Young CSK players will need to find spark to win this game.",5
Dunno whether to cheer or not for that 50,5
"Is the pitch this way only at this time of the tournament and Csk are using their spinners to strangle the opposition

Or has it always been this way and csk just shit the bed with their team selection of trusting  Chawla and Karn",6

Headshot,6
So chahar gonna bowl the last one?,2

Once again Kohli getting 80% of his runs through running,12
Kohli calling for no ball before the umpire xD,6

"Something somewhere tells me apart from ab virat doesn't trust others ..That's why when ab gets out before him he prefers to take it deep and take chances in last 2 overs to avoid all out...Safe strategy but rcb scores 15 , 20 less.

Best csk player for a reason,15
"Damn, that was an amazing ball for a free hit",8
Where is king kumar? Wth is this shit?,2
Wicket here like Shankar.,0
Imagine not bowling out your highest wicket taker,11
Every bowler bowls like Michael Holding after conceding a no ball,5
Mark and sanga dropping truth bombs,2
Why is Curran only bowling 3 overs?,11
So only 2 boundaries for kohli till now? What has happened to him this season?,2
Kohli out this over,5

Faf.,4

Faf du pleases once again,4
We went from 200+ scores to 120+ scores in no time,11
Fuck you Faf.,1

Kohli being Rahul with the 50(43),2
Is it  safe to say test match players will succeed in this pitch?,2
Fuck faf....,1

Brilliant catch from Faf,6
Does Faf even drop catches,12
"Don't do this CSK, don't give me hope",6
How big is this ground ffs,5
The way RCB batting lineup is batting CSK will really have to do thier best today,5
Kohli bc waiting for 20th over to accelerate like Thala,4
Faf is a frigging superman,10
Faf best outfield catcher in the game atm. Fact,12
Only Faf knows how to field in CSK,13
Ok dont hit it down the ground clearly :/,5
Duplesis is omnipresent.,8
This is what CSK had in mind with this squad on Chepauk,43
It's not the old age pensioners it's just faf.,5

"Tough pitch and all, but this is exactly the kind of target which Dhoni's team will feel confident to chase down.",3
This is the guy CSK didn't even bowl last game,6
"Ah, someone caught on the straight boundary. Who could have predicted that.",7
Faf getting a catching practice is good for next season.,5
Damn Faf doesn't know how to drop a catch. Not really suitable for IPL,12
He made it look so simple,1
good job 0.5 sachin,1
That sounded like it should have been a 6. Wtf is this pitch,4
"**18.6** Curran to Kohli, OUT, yet another man perished trying to take on the slowness of this pitch **138-5**

"""Magnificent innings from Kohli"", seriously sanga?",5
The boundary rope is actually made of Faf,10
Wonder why no commentator ever points out how fucking slow kohli plays in every game. Literally incapable of hitting boundaries consistently,4
Are the Currans from South Africa?,-1
Good innings,2
Again a wicket of the slower ball. I hope RCB have not blundered this by dropping Udana.,4
I don't think it was THAT MAGNIFICENT sanga.,2
Aakash chopra would have made faf and catch rhyme seeing that fielding effort.,1
Inb4 Gurkeet and Morris getting 20 runs of the last over.,1
Such a pitch this is that 50(43) gets called magnificent by the commentators.,9
"Just adapting this innings, can't help it with this pitch. Nothing conventional here it's a struggle.",2
Lol it's not magnificent. Just an average knock,7
"Bruh how hard is it??

Don't loft where jaddu and faf are standing",6

I don't know what's gonna happen in the finals if the pitches are already like this.,7
"Has Faf ever dropped a catch? Literally never seen him drop one, ever.",3
He has caught almost all catches at long on. What  a Gun Fielder!!,1
I have a hunch CSK just might win this match. I think this pitch suits there batting line up.,5
Sam my boy got 3 wickets!,5
Udana could have been useful on this pitch.,6
Kohli by Run-Machine you didn't mean *Run*-machine. Right?... Right??,2
"Morris: Hey how did Moeen and AbD get out on the right side of the ground? I thought they were left handers. 

Koach: Here, I'll show you but I'm a right hander so I'll get out on the left.",7
That second ball wasn't a wide . Cost Kohli his wicket with that extra ball here.,8
Damn even AB struggled? Wtf,11
I don't believe this slow pitch BS. I think csk will chase this down,10
Faf showing how to field to everyone,5
"Ball goes towards the ground

FAF: It’s free real estate",15
That was rather an easy catch because FaF made it look so easy,8
Alright let's calm down giving a relatively slow 50 too much credit in t20,6
"Seriously, why do they play T20s on such shit pitches? Keep the slow pitches for Tests.",6
Burr-keerat Singh,3
This is like how DC played yesterday while chasing.,9
Commentators would have shat* on their tactics had it been another pair,5
"I get that he wants to accelerate but it's not possible on this pitch, why not stay there and push for 2's?",3
Pitches like this should only be allowed in Sharjah,9
"I absolutely believe rcb will win this, this pitch looks terrible. If ABD and Kohli can't hit, I don't think anyone in csk can",6
"If you're thinking this is struggle, wait for 2nd inning",8
i think Udana might have been amazing in this pitch.,7
Dugout simping to Kohli for this innings; can imagine the hate Rahul would have got for a similar innings,7
"Even if we don't make the playoffs, it's at least gratifying to see our boys in yellow still cause a bit of problems for the RCB gang.",4
"Slow wicket + massive straight boundaries + Faf patrolling them is just one helluva combo. 

Faf covers ground so quickly and his anticipation is world class.",14
"Kinda have a feeling that CSK may win this one. With this pitch, hitting boundaries is super difficult which CSK hasn't anyway been good at. But rotating the strike and hitting a 150 at the end of 20 overs is totally doable if they maintain the SR by taking those quick ones and twos.",4
This pitch is real slow. Yesterday everyone struggled and today also. 150 should be a competitive score,9
50 off 44 is not ideal honestly. Once you've played 30 balls you must bat the remaining balls at around 180-200 SR.,-1
What's the point of batting depth till 8 when u dont trust them.,-4
If you apply skinnyvirat cheatcode on virat kohli you get gurkeeratman,2
"Faf du Plessis, love you professional, but hate you personally!",-3
Lmao did that ball spin after the pitch!,2
Faf on the boundary is like a frog catching flies. Does not miss.,8
"The ball is not at all coming on to the bat. Pitches are deteriorating as the tournament progresses.


I get that there should be a contest between the ball and the bat, but we are just going to see some 130-140 scores.",8
"When chahar and Curran look like good death bowlers, yk the pitch is really shit.",4
"Don't hit in areas reachable by Faf, rookie mistake /s",11
Curran won't finish his quota of overs. Sigh...  #JustDhoniThings,6
All twos and no hits make Koach a dull boy,5
"Everyone saying the pitch is slow and 150 enough, trollers ready with alternating caps text when CSK starts firing.",1
Ali is rubbish,-1
"All of CSK Fans : Let's have Meme Siraj and Not Lord Siraj today, please please please !!!!",4
They have not really bowled all that well in the final overs.  But haven't paid the price for it.,5
Sad to see Steyn play just 1 match,1
Is the final being played on this pitch? Please tell me no,4
These are the UAE pitches we hate and despise.,6
Since batsmen get hot during the  game esp here why not create helmets lined with those liquids in cooling packs on the inside? Ipl teams have the money right?,3
"If Morris is struggling , pitch is slow",6
wow Chahar with wickets now!,1
Pitch looks difficult to bat on.,4
Scurran and Faf should just form their own team cause they deserve so much better,3
I hate slower balls now,6
Csk fucked us,4
"This pitch should suit Csk and their game plan to a T .

An interesting chase beckons",8
Does Du Plessis have the most number of catches at the boundary?,2
BEAUTIFUL YORKER,3
Stick with singles and doubles please,2
Death bowling Chahar > Powerplay Chahar,2
My sexual orientation is crunchy wicket noises.,5
"If RCB lose today, I want RCB in the eliminator. They have a bad record against meme teams. KKR has definitely became a meme team this IPL. But first we need to qualify.",1
"If AB can't hit a six in an innings of 36 balls, you bet this pitch is slow!",31
Dude has passed couple of catches to others. Still has highest catches.,28
CSK gonna bottle this,5
Why is CSK save for a few misfields suddenly performing this match out of all matches?,13
Chahar is one handsome bastard,3
"CSK gonna cruise past this,aren't they?",7
Udana would be good for this pitch,3
"Imagine being yorked by Chahar

Good ball though",5
Morris shocked not to see Shami bowling.,2
"Wait, I thought we were going to shit ourselves in the last 4 overs... What is this magic?",3
At least Chahar isn't broken yet. Nice to see him smile and bowling with a plan,3
"This isn't even fun to watch. Maybe an entertaining day 2 pitch, but not a T20 pitch.",3
WHAT A DELIVERY,2
Dhenier went easy on RCB's ass. Should've unleashed the full power of my main man Monu.,10
"**19.3** Chahar to Morris, OUT, yorker. The pitch doesn't matter here. This is just the quick yorker after that big slower one last ball. Disturbs the furniture **139-6**

CH Morris  b Chahar 2 (5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 40.00",4
"lowest score defended by RCB ?

Against CSK?",1
[deleted],0
CSK can win this game,4
Chad chahar smile,1
Ramp shot from Washington incoming,2
I just want to see VKs face when Dhoni fucks Morris,-4
Wtf has happened to Chris Morris' batting,-4
"Unless some youngsters turns up , the usual suspects in csk would again defend their way to make a meal of this chase ...Last over finish or shitshow on cards ?",2
"Until Kohli was out you guys wanted boundaries, now you ppl want singles and twos. We'd give anything to have someone like Kohli in our squad",10
Looks like we can't get 150,6
"RCB the real BatDeep

They have an opener at 8",14
A score of 140-145 looks good on this slow pitch minding yesterday's night game,8
"Yes CSK be spoilsports, This is the Way.",11
Why tf did the camera man cut away.,2
"Fuck, slow outfield too man",8
They are doing a good job of tiring faf,8
Sundar took one ball to outscore both Moeen and Morris,8
"Ball won't even reach the keeper, can't wait to see how this clown team are going to bat 2nd innings",8
Too early for wE hAvE a bAt tHaNks?,3
Not a bad shot for your first ball,2
Nah. Should have sent gurkeerat man instead of virat if they only wanted to rotate strike. If anyone can hit at death its abd.,-3
"Just remember last match here when kxip struggled their way to 125 and srh shit the bed chasing it

Maybe we should watch csk's batting before judging",10
So many batsmen. Sundar at 8 is amgood batting depth tbf,8
Sundar is like fuck this pitch fuck them all,23
It’s a shame that the game is already beyond CSK. Pretty sure they’re incapable of chasing anything more than 6 an over.,13
"Oh I have missed Chahar's death bowling.

Remember him bowling a ripper in last year's final against Pandya and Pollard just conceding 5 runs!",8
So these uncles don't turn up the entire season and now they wanna win games.,9
"Wtf, is there multiple Faf's outisde the 30 yard circle?",15
Liking these low score matches.,2
Another match in which team left far too much for the death overs depite having wickets in hand.,-3
This tournament will be boring. I understand 200 pitches are boring. But at least 160 should be on to make people want to watch IPL,2
Rcb in self-sabotage mode,0
"Yas make Fafdu run, drain his energy so he gives his wicket easily.",1
"What lodu batting this is. I mean, 145 is still defensible I guess but fuck.",-2
The W in CSK stands for Winning,9
"Slow pitch, slow outfield. Old CSK. Yeah this is gonna be tough",8
Match so boring faf decided to take  a nap,15
"Very slow outfield, Kohli's way of taking 2s is the only way to win",15
Both pooran and abd batted 30+ balls in the pitch without hitting a six.,50
"If Koach couldn't get going, nobody else can.",20
"145+ is RCBs game, chill out lads",7
Chahar wicket farming,2
Terrible batting or really good bowling. Could not get ball out of boundary line.,6
"ABDV, Moeen, Kohli & Morris all tried to score a boundary and got out, only Sundar succeeded. Sundar > all the above batsmen, hence proved.",30
"We live in a timeline where Simon Doull brought up Brian Lara before Mark Nicholas

Wtf",9
argh fuck,3
Wishing a Moeen show  with the ball,8
Gurkeert specialist fielder,2
See you on wednesday.,6
That's a good score imo.,7
Above par score.,8
CSK bowling looked good after 11 fucking matches,8
Probably 10-15 runs short. Just hope siraj doesn't fuck up and we should be fine given the pitch and CSKs batting,13
I'd still say it's an above par score considering the pitch and CSK batting,3
Now that was death bowling,-1
These are the Chepaukesque conditions conducive to CSK's style of play,1
"The fact that ab struggled really shows how difficult it is

Morris and Moeen couldn't even connect",14
"Barring MI , looks like anybody can lose to anybody on their day ?? Isn't it ??",8
 CSK should win this if they bat sensibly. Poor batting from RCB.,-6
"If we get faf and jaddu out, that's the game imo, cause those are good rotaters of the strike",5
Csk 60 all out. Siraj 5fer.,9
Thank God we restricted RCB for 145. Now we will only lose by 25 runs.,26
"If Faf is able to stick out the powerplay, they have a good chance of chasing this down.",5
Watch our NRR tank after this,5
"First 10 overs - 72 runs 

Last 10 overs - 73 runs.

Perfectly balanced.",15
Weird first innings score where both teams are disappointed at the end,9
Powerplay crucial on this pitch. Lack of timing is less of a penalty with less fielders outside circle.,2
I have been happy with our bowling effort this season. If only batting and fielding were as good.,5
"Siraj will frick csk.......

i dont hope so but still my 7th sense is telling that...",4
It's a really good score tbh. 70-30 RCB already.,6
Time to choke the CSK,1
Any other team chasing and I'd say it's their game to lose,1
"Entire RCB team with low strike rate

Chad Sundar with 250 strike rate",10
Ez pz for CSK. They're gonna finish in 18,4
I hope top two fights goes on to the last match of DC with RCB.,3
This pitch isn’t  that different from the Chepauk pitches. CSK should chase this down if they play sensibly rather than their usual tuk-tuk+take it deep.,6
daddy sundar with a sr greater than that of vk and ab combined,9
Csk has a good chance today.,4
I just want to see Gaikwad execute a shot today. I hope it’s not too much to ask of him. Fingers crossed,6
"No one:

Cred guy in the heaviest possible voice: Let's just do a simplednfjdkdidnjfkdndjf bxhdhdmcka",11
"Chennai performing well on chennai type pitch 
   
Change of venues really fucked up their plans",10
"ABD couldn't go ballistic, means no one can go ballistic",15
RCB should open with Sundar and play Udana instead of Finch.,7
"Fleming : So why didn't you bowl him out ?

Dhoni : The world isn't ready for his powers yet!",11
I think this is only a par score. Yesterday KXIP only won because SRH were pathetic.,15
Washington “Brian Lara” Sundar,12
We might lose this but atleast we bowled with great over rate.,6
"Decent score, could have been a lot higher but CSK's death bowling saved them a little bit",6
Dhoni's hair on his head is now fully grey.,8
CSK's death bowling saved 5-10 runs for sure,12
For how long will we keep playing Finch? Fail after fail,7
"Sorry for being harsh, Monu is awful. Wish him luck in the future.",4
"If boundaries are hard to come, CSK will need to run lots of ones and twos. Can they do that?",7
Mere Bhai Siraj Ka swag Dekho,19
"I am expecting a CSK win here, just to get koach's ass on fire for his run a ball innings.",2
Just drop finch already. Abd will be able to bat much more freely if he doesn't have to keep,7
So Finch 15(11) wasn't that bad,24
Some body convince faf that we are playing aus.,9
CSK will bat like there's nothing wrong with the pitch and chase the target in 17.2 overs. Dhoni masterclass 32*(28) today.,9
Finally slower pitch and udana not in the squad,6
Fuck of you to all saying terrible batting performance from us. A batting with Rahul Gayle pooran maxwell could only hit 126.,37
"Washi, Chahal, and Moeen are gonna have a field day on this pitch",6
Final CSK score: 131-5 in 20 overs. ThalaGod 34*(36).,8
Feel like Indian commentators are much more Conservative in thier approach when it comes to critizing players or just asking tough questions.. In English commentary Mark Taylor asked Sangakara whether a player like Kholi with all his fame and popularity in india can subconsciously affect an umpires decision and sanga just straight out agreed.. Even during the CSK post match presentation a lot of hard questions were asked to Dhoni regarding his team selection and comments.. KP talking about intent of Rayudu was also great stuff.. Just feel like there's needs to be a better brand of commentary from Indian commentators,20
Monu Kumar actually bowled decently. Would be sad to just look at 10 rpo in his debut game to diss him.,10
RCB should have scored 160 after the first 10 overs they had. They are short and if CSK can bat well for once they will chase easily.,6
"Faf was being a good lad in that first catch. Like how older bros make a catch easy and hand it to the young kid. Gaikwad would have loved that confidence.

PS, I still drop those kind of Parrys!",5
I’m so confused about this score and first innings. Is it good is it bad lmao,7
Two continuous matchs on the same pitch is sure fire for it to be a low scoring game.,3
"Faf is already tired, he will lose his wicket soon",1
"Worried about our fast bowlers on this wicket. 

Morris and Saini like to hit a hard length and Siraj is an excellent red ball bowler who can look for early seam movement.

This is more an Udana kinda wicket. Bowl cutters every ball. 

12 overs of spin should choke CSK but death bowling could be tricky if if you're not adept at bowling cutters and exploiting the pitch. 

If CSK need something like 60 off from 8 overs with wickets in hand, they'll win this.",16
"Genuine Q. For a short person like Monu, are shots normally considered as regular balls for other batsmen considered as full toss/bouncer for him  giving him extra ball?",4
"You literally saw a team defend 124 and abd, kohli,pooran struggling in this pitch and acting like this is par score.",15
Fleming to Santner- Jor Jor se bolke sabko scheme bata de,10
Whoever wins the powerplay will probably win this game.,16
RCB didn't even put enough runs on board so that Gaikwad and Jagadeesan can hit a century each. Smh at you Koach.,20
Santner's face cut is so fucking good. Handsome lad.,12
"Wtf, why are all the kiwi players so well spoken? Cant see anything wrong with NZ players honestly",31
Rcb game to lose,-2
I think someone like Dhoni who relies more on strength than pace of the ball can hit the ball very well on this pitch. Even guys like Gayle and Pollard will do good too.,6
Just want to see Gaikwad and Jagadeeshan score some runs.,6
Thala issued a challenge to RCB batsmen to try to win his jersey today.,8
Csk will target moeen.,1
Tahir would've had much lower economy if everyone didn't misfield whenever he bowled,6
145 is a perfect score for Dhoni's batting nautanki.,12
[deleted],3
Santner said R/L at the front. So who’s it gonna be if its not Curran? Jadeja???,3
Go hard in the PP before we resort to the tried n tested tuk tuk in mid overs.,4
Inb4 Siraj Hat-trick,5
"Would've been carefree if it was 160, but 145's not bad. Could get close",13
How did AB struggle on this pitch? I've never seen him struggle even on slow pitches,14
Santner such a cutie.,6
You think CSK will try out Asif next match? What other youngster do you think they can give a game?,7
"Place your bets, who's getting Dhoni's jersey today? My bet is on either DDP or Siraj",31
Finchy with second highest SR... stupid sexy finch,25
"They need to get about 60 in the first 6, when the ball is new and hard. But they don't really have batsmen do it.",0
"Looks a par score on this wicket with rcb bowling and csk batting , shd sent Curran or santher to open . This pitch will make ipl boring though",2
"Random question since there is a break,how safe it is to hangout (pubs,etc) in the current situation?",2
AB didn't struggle. He wanted to keep wickets till the end but got out on a bad shot.,9
Are Jagdeesan and the other guy playing again?,5
"CSK gonna win this one, isn't it?",8
"My man virat, how much stamina do you have",4
"Dhoni and Fleming would love to see Rutu and Jaggi fire today. Either way, alot of people will find ways to rub it in on thier faces despite whatever happens",10
There was almost 0 swing in the beginning. Looks like Siraj will be 3-0-31-0 today.,6
I remember Asif doing well in the one or two games he had played for CSK. He should get a game next,2
CSK will have to score atleast 60 runs in the PP before the pitch slows down even further to have any semblance of chance in this match.,1
If RCB wins the match Virat Kohli’s innings is a “carefully constructed innings that made all the difference”. If CSK wins it becomes “a rather slow and uncalled for drudgery”.,23
If CSK somehow pull this off it's gonna make SRH look really bad,11
"Just tuned in 

How did this Monu guy bowled?",4
Can rcb trade pp to rr?,0
Send Monu to open. Every ball will be an over head wide or waist high full toss. Free runs.,10
Will csk open with Sam and faf? Go for an attacking start?,4
"Damn, I missed watching the nearly mythical creature that is Monu Kumar bowl.",2
"Youngsters, pls show some spark today. Proving Thala wrong would be a bonus",5
Ah time for Dhoni ass licking im Byju's cricket live.,6
"I am optimistic we can defend this.

It is really rare that both Kohli and AB hold back for so long after getting set, if the aim was for 180 one of them would have attacked from the 13th over or so like they usually do when we bat 1st. They must have thought 160 or so is a winning score and planned for that, only for both to get out with exploding.

And both Moeen and Morris could not time even 1 ball properly when new to the crease, so this does seem like a tricky pitch. And against CSK's batting, even if we are few runs below par we should be able to defend.",18
I don’t know why people are saying RCB are 10-15 runs short. If AB de villiers of all players is striking at 100 after 35 balls then it’s a sign that it’s a tough wicket to bat. Won’t be easy to chase this down,13
Pls don't have over expectations from Siraj.,6
[deleted],6
This is CSK's match to lose and lose they will.,7
Pitches getting far slower. *Sandeep Lamichhane on bench* Everyone to Punter- Execute Order 66,9
Is this going to be enough?,4
Anyone have an accurate height of Monu? Google says 5’10 but c’mon...,4
"Ah, Dhoni vs Chahal battle except it isn’t going to be much of battle.",7
Fhow many runs will gaikwad make today?,1
Thala will be the difference between defeat and win today,-2
Unpopular opinion but I'd like to see Faf as captain once Dhoni retires.,7
Genuine Q. How do all the stump cams work? They don't look like they have wires or anything right? And how are they not broken ever?,5
"RCB still doesn't have a Pollard, Andre Russell type player in the middle order. Dube was supposed to be that, but he is just been underwhelming. Puts pressure on Kohli + ABd to anchor innings for an over or two more.",13
"If de Villiers couldn’t got above 108 SR, what will others do?",6
I'm scared of this Siraj guy,6
"Please CSK, win this one for us. Thanks, love MI.",5
Is faf pronounced as fap?,-4
Rashford for PM with SCurran as his Dommy C equivalent,9
I just learned that 2021 mega auction might be postponed. Rip CSK.,10
CSK need an excellent powerplay if they are to win this. They need 80 in the first 10 overs.,5
Look at that MI NRR man. Wtaf,5
How does a pitch get slower towards the end of the innings? Please explain thanks,5
Who's Kolhi looking at?,3
"I don't think 145 is par, even tho it's csk and the pitch is slow. One good innings and it's game over for rcb",6
[removed],5
highest run ever scored in powerplay coming Bois/Uncles/granduncles,10
"If (when) a wicket falls in the powerplay, I'd be tempted to send Lord Thakur to throw his bat around and get 20(10) before scoring gets harder.

Edit: Nvm, I didn't pay any attention to team selection today.",7

**WE KNOW**",2
"If kxip retained Sam, they would have been unstoppable.",6
This is exactly the type of game csk will win lmao,6
I'm i the only one or do the fielders take screamers frequently against Kohli,6
Faf is gonna be the key for CSK today. He is very good on slower pitches like this one.,9
Csk's match to win.,6
Get it Monu! Best wishes from fellow statemate.,7
Got late and missed all the Monu memes 😪,5
Green caps looks nice tho,1
Lol looking at the comments and both teams are scared shtless of Siraj,15
T20 should be high scoring games and tests should be low scoring games. That's best way to enjoy cricket,-5
That absymmal stats of Ruthuraj,-1
Scenes when Sundar wins altroz super striker award,6
This guy has had a tough start to his ipl career. Fuckk,6
"Hope Ruturaj does well today

Still think Faf should take strike as the senior batsman",2
"Dhoni should have a shot as an opener, that might solve a few problems",3
Rcb vs csk? Na it's luigi vs wario,5
siraj to leak 15 runs or take a wicket maiden first over,9
Sundar to open?,4
I'd say this score is around par. The only reason we defended 120 odd was SRH's choke tbh,7
Faf looks like Joaquin Phoenix,10
Hopefully CSK go out there and bat like a team with nothing to lose... Mainly because they are a team with nothing left to lose.,3
4 matches 5 runs - Ruttu. Bruh.,10
"Did AB just scream ""Aiyoo""?",10
"5 runs from 4 matches. Bro, WTF is you doing here?",10
"Siraj be like : I'm not trapped in here with you, you're trapped in here with ME",9
If these bottom four start winning now it would be pretty hilarious.,12

Confirmed : Kartik Tyagi is the missing son of dada tyagi,1
"20 runs from power play , 40 runs in the first 10 overs incoming.",13
"By sticking his tongue out, Rutu is asserting his dominance over RCB bowlers already",30
Fun fact - RCB has never done a double on CSK.,20
Gaikwad increased his number of IPL runs by 20% just now,25
CSK 104/6 after 20 overs,15
I just tuned in. How did csk bowl?,4
Washy bowling exactly like what is needed on this pitch. Excellent,15
Off topic- Those kids in OPPO F17 pro ad are so damn cute!,17

Horrible start. They have start to dig a hole already.,3
"Kohli always stands near Abd, But then, who wouldn't ?",12
Holy duck gaikwad is fast compared to Rayudu and the others,9
Not a bad throw,5
Holy shit wtf was that effort from gurkeerat.,0
Morris needs to take pace off,4
"I support RCB but CSK should go hard and try to finish under 15 overs. They don't need points, they need confidence going out of the tournament. And more importantly, Dhoni's career should not end with this shit show.",8
Gaekwad's heart must be pounding for everyone in the middle to hear.,9
if RCB win I want Kohli to rip his shirt out and scream Jai Shri Ram while burning an effigy of Raavan in true desi style,8
We need to cramp them for singles and make them work very hard for their runs,2
"Ah yes, Gaikwad Smile! This will get better!",9
"Morris: Takes pace off

Ball: 133 kph",17
"Fuck it, bowl 12 overs of spin upfront.

Need 48/2 after 12 overs",9
No. No boundaries allowed for CSK 😠,14
These lot are some how going to make it 14 RRR before halfway through,5
Bangar describing a direct hit as an inaccurate throw. Scenes,14
Lol I took Monu Singh in my fantasy team just cause... Idk why lol for the same reasons CSK took him I guess,18
Wtf was that bowling,3
India have stopped producing great batsmen against spin.  New breed are  from average to poor.,12
Faf ❤️,3
SHOT,2
That was sweet,2
Pls get du Plessis out,5
Finally a bad day for Morris?,10
Morris... need.... more.... PACE.,9
Of course they find their form after they cant qualify.,29
"Oh man what the hell, now the sixes come on easily",12
Imagine having Morris as your international player,5
SHIT ON,8
These flick shots for 6 just look outrageous. Blimey.,8
CSK winning this,4
We're gonna lose this aren't we,8
CSK shitting on the top teams chances from the Bottom  of the table is peak 2020,12
Think they’ll just bowl spin for a few overs now,5
RUT-A-TUT!!,2
Don't give me hope,3
SPARKKK,9
Ok so we're going to lose,12
Lmao gaikwad just scored more than his total runs this season before this match with that shot,22
Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck,12
So this is what RCB lack upfront - the ability to give quick starts. Wonder if phillipe could help it. Haven't seen him enough.,5
"2 sixes already, CSK need to make the most of the powerplay",6
Csk gonna with 10 wickets,4
"

"Of course. Of fucking course.


They find their fucking form after it is all over.",18
Damn that was silky smooth from Rutu,10

Only if RCB get FAF out.. We're in for a thrilling final day final innings test match on our hands,10
"“That’s why they’ve picked him” 

Lolol except they didn’t coz he lacked spark",9

"Not the worst target RCB have set, esp against Dadaji Nanaji Aur Ek Do Pote XI, but I just always assume they'll lose to them.

No different this time. Guess I'm a true RCB fan.",7
😢,6
Gaikwad showing off his spark,5
Faf and Gaikwad are not making this look like a day 5 pitch now wtf,6
Fuck you csk for fucking our top2 chances,18
Kohli needs to stop playing spin against Rutu,4
CSK finding form against RCB. Just like old times.,23
Gaikwad showing INTENT as well as the SPARK,10
Spark bc :D,6
Woah intent... I'm not used to this.,9
"All of a sudden gaikwad looks confident. I hope he gets a few runs today, shit must be tough for him.",17
CSK gonna win in 18 overs calling it early,7
"Aur mahi bsdk, dekh spark.",3
My lad Gaikwad becoming the first Indian guy to hit Washi for a six in the PP even before he hit a four in his IPL career.,6
only true rcb fans know we cant beat csk even in their worst season,18
The collapse starts next over.,2
Get Siraj ffs,5

Tahir infected Kolhi almost there,5
CSK gonna shithouse their way to the title don't @me,4
There's a touch of young Rahane with this Gaikwad kid,2
SpArk,1
Gaikwad looking like budget 3D,7
Kohli is really helping Dhoni out here,2
"I saw Gaikwad execute a shot. Man, I’m really happy.",9
So..... 10 wicket loss for RCB?,3
65 million years. Zap,1
Things will slow down after the powerplay like RCB did,7
Lmao we can't beat CSK even at their worst.,7
Bring Siraj on! (Can’t believe I am saying this),5
DDP’s soul is being sucked out batting with Finch,3
"They are running 2's, do you see that ? They are running 2's!!",8

"*Aah yes Bangar, good to know Jad got three triple centuries*",0
🎇🎇 MS wishing us all a happy Diwali with all this spark,6
"Maybe the wicket was slow or whatever, but they bowled really well",2
 They would have had to chase 170-180 if we got a better start from the top. The team needs to really start asking questions and maybe even swap Finch out.,0
"This is a typical CSK and MS Dhoni kinda chase, they just have to avoid shitting the bed.",2
"If CSK find their form this match, they truly are the meme team.

But honestly, if the youngsters perform, looking good for next year.",3
Yeah let's boast about his first class starts on a t20 match,3
"CSK gonna spoil a lot of people's IPL even though they're getting the wooden spoon, love to see it.",5
"This over can go either of two ways


Edit : lmao",2
Udana would have liked this pitch,8
"Looks like this is the script for RCB today.

Get tonked in the power play. 

Chahal gets a wicket in his second over.

Another wicket falls in the next over.

RCB gets their hopes up.

Opponent team number 4/5 does a bit of tuktuk and then blasts. Comfortable win.


Presentation: *We were 20 runs short and dew...*",19
Cmon Siraj please.,2
Man I thought this pitch was super slow but maybe not so much. Still believe rcb can clutch this,2
Off topic but I guess no SRH fan is watching this match after yesterday's depression. Kinda lost the intent/spark to watch IPL anymore :(,6
"Never fear, Siraj is here",8
Rayudu : Fuck !!! These mofos are going to start expecting me to run now.,20
Siraj looking dangerous,8
"Before anyone gets too excited, reminder that RCB also started well in the powerplay

As did KXIP and SRH yesterday",10
Pack it up bois. It's over.,9
Take that Doni,1

SPARKLING INTENT uWu!,3
Why didn't you play him earlier MS? Why?,6
"the bottom team sabotaging other teams' chances... this is exactly what happens in every tournament, why didn't I see this coming lmao",6

*Sparks* everywhere,4
SPARK^TM,6
"I don't know much about Gaekwad, but if he has reputation to play well against spin he has the responsiblity to take them down",2
Who’s the old dude who’s made to wave the flags and blow whistles for csk every match?,1
Why everyone gets in form when playing against rcb,12
PACE OFFFFFFF,2
"Fuck, Kolhi looked pissed there also Also why his hand bandaged?",5
Who is that csk uncle waving the flag?,2
Loooord Gaikwad??,1
Gotta love fellow RCB fans here being all shocked - exactly which team did you think you were supporting? You can take RCB out of their Chokezone (ie India) but you can't take the choke out of RCB.,7
"I've seen it with players, it's the first time I've seen r/cricket meme an entire team into form.",6
"CSK showing spark and intent after it is all over.

All part of the Dhoni masterplan.",13

"Imagine that

Play a young batsman in his actual position for more than one game in a row and he shows some of his actual batting ability",27
"Good start Chennai, noice!",8
CSK giving hope to other teams for top 2 slot,7
Hopefully green jersey for 1 match only,3
"Guys, is it just me or do you see some spark here?",3
Lord siraj repeat your magic please,3
Running between the wickets wow,1
The little man must feel better now. Must've been a hard 10 days.,1
"I would like to see siraj getting tonked,just for the memes",1
There's something satisfying about batsmen hoofing shots in the powerplay knowing they aren't going to get out.,1
"fuck it this game's gone, lets settle for 3rd place",6
How do you add flair to username?,1
Hitting boundaries AND taking singles. What kind of sorcery is this?,3
This is great batting,2
Siraj is back boys,9
Gaikwad looks so scared but then goes out and hits it like that. Sparkling. :D,2
Madarchod,2

"Virat: Behenchod, it was me all along.",3
"Faf needs to write ""Fuck it Just Ramp"" on his bat handle.",8
Is it too early to say that Sam Curran is better than Bradman? I guess we could wait until the end of the match to be absolutely sure....,12
"Despite his heroics last match, Siraj has been a pretty average bowler in IPLs with ECO of over 9",3
WTF is happening!!,2

Wtf! Siraj,3
This is how you use the powerplay,6
"I'm starting to think ""pitch slowing down"" and ""dew coming into play"" are the biggest BS we've been fed in cricket. Maybe they have some effect but not as much as people claim they have",2

"Haha people really put a Siraj apology thread out of desperation. Tewatia genuinely deserved one, not this scrub.",10

"Everyone commenting RCB brings oppositions into form 

Lol seriously let's count 

Samson scored against CSK 

Dhawan given 5 lives to get his 100 

Prithvi scored against CSK

Boult's best bowling against CSK 

And the list goes on and on and on.",2
I used to think Faf was the usual slow starter compared to other openers. Oh how the turntables this year!,2
Chahal doing whistle podu.,3
Is there something like a reverse apology thread on r/cricket for siraj,12
Siraj miyan what are you doing bro,2
CSK trying to their best to save Dhoni's pride. The only way to do that is to not let the game reach MSD's batting.,0
How's the ~~Josh~~ spark,5
RCB should drop kohli. sucks the momentum of the innings. GO play this kind of cricket in your ODI's,-4
Good to see old Siraj back,1

This is the rcb I missed this season,9
"RCB were 36-1 at this stage 

The real challenge is after the powerplay ends",7
"gaikwad looks like he can play alright! poor guy's season was wasted 'cause of csk management.

btw, remember how csk bought wridhhiman and benched him season after season because of dhoni? dude finally got out of that prison and scored a century in the final and almost made kkr win. the best keeper in India after Dhoni was forced to miss out on at least 3 seasons of IPL because CSK bought him, knowing very well he will be benched! anyway, less competition for Dhoni, I guess. Hail Srini!",15
"Everyone deserves 1 bad day yaar..


Siraj had it against KKR.",23

Dhoni-You have done well cheeku but yunno you need to lose one so that you peak at the right time and win the final

Kohli-Say no more I know what to do",8
"The concept of the powerplay is literally designed to encourage quick run scoring and make things easier for batsmen, so why do so many teams get sucked into the trap of anchoring and consolidating during this phase?",2
Can see why Rituraj got covid easily. Probably always has his tongue stuck out like that,6
Finch with a nice thicc belly,5
"It's understandable but unfortunate that we backed Watson too long this season.

Gaikwad should have been given the chance to open much earlier.",7
RCB depending on their bowling is peak 2020,7
RCB have gone incompetent on field again,2
Nice to see Karnataka teams(rcb&kxip) trying to revive us inspite of the so called south rivalry.,3
RCB becoming complacent now,1
"If rcb is gonna play the middle overs with such a low run rate anyways, why don’t they play Parthiv, at least he’s more consistent than finch.",3
Is this... strike rotation? :o,3
Now that I think about it Rutu had Covid so might have been a little off cos of that after that. Obviously he would have been fit and everything but it could have been a factor also in him being more nervous and a possible reason for him not performing,3
Can't spell Chennai Super Kings without spark,6
De Villiers buying into the chirpy keeper club as well.,6
Siraj during post-match presentation: if you only love me at my best then you don't deserve me.,14
I can already see RCB losing to RCB v2.0 in the Eliminator.,4
Hopefully CSK does not pull an SRH,5
Can rcb learn from new rcb (kxip) and defend a low total?,5
What a catch siraj,7
Game on lads,2
Saw a post earlier saying csk has a 1% chance of making top 4 if they win today. My mind voice : Jim Carey saying so you’re telling me there is a chance,13

Uffff ... Finally a big wicket,6

Why did they choose today to show their spark,21
A single spark burning down rcb..,14
OC four,3
"Ok, loosing confidence",12
Ben Foakes would have caught that.,19
Of all the days csk had to turn up today. But at least Dhoni saw some *Spark* today probably.,15
You can tell why Rayudu failed the yo-yo test,10
Diwali has come early for gaikwad,16
Hope Jagadeesan shows the spark as well.,11
Padikkal and Gaikwad were the top 2 runscorers in Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy last season,26
Slip for spin on this pitch mate always,6
Obviously a tough catching chance but am I being harsh in thinking AB should've got something on it at least,2
I said spark. Now upvote 🔫,6
How much Spark^(TM) is too much Spark^(TM)?,5
Fuck CSK for existing,-13
"I feel I'm saying this for the 1000th time, but Mo is only ever supposed to bowl one over in T20s ffs",6
I still remember interview of Gaikwad's father in 2017 who's from Pune saying their dream is to see Gaikwad play for Rising Pune Supergiants and captain RPS one day. Sadly that team is erased from our memory like 1984 novel suggested 😞,21

Cricket has been going on for centuries now.. So much has changed now but if if you ask me what's the one thing that hasn't changed.. It will probably be Gavaskar and single after a six comment... Man doesn't shut up about it,8

Kohli's calmness is gone now.,5
Is that enough SPARK for you Thala?,4
Gaikwad's career runs has seen a growth of 700 percent in this match...,8
calling it. 3 wickets gonna fall  & full on tuk tuk,4
"CSK bowled very well today, and the intent that they’ve shown with the bat must be refreshing. They are on clear course to win. They may not be able to qualify, but with their spinners and boosted confidence they can certainly
influence the results to come.",8

why that length at that pace smh,2

:’),1
Why pace on the ball. How many times do the commentators have to say no pace?,2
Everyone in CSK is playing well today. From good captain tactics to good bowling to good fielding to good batting. tHey got everything together today.,6
Oh god Saini in. The man has incredible pace but looks so out of control.,2
"RCB bowlers: sees CSK bowlers bowl for 20 overs with cutters and slower ball bouncers into the surface

Also RCB bowlers: hahaha 90mph bouncers go vroom",12
On a slow pitch it’s preferable to bowl even slower which RCB bowlers aren’t doing right now. Let the batsmen generate their own pace off the bat.,3
Won't mind if CSK wins today,5
[deleted],11
Makes Sense seeing the amount of sparks now. Dusshera is here,6
Should've kept Udana. His change of pace is actually useful in this kind of pitch.,6

Ah Sunny G and that Mumbai reference in every match!,2
"The type of innings that Gaikwad is playing is exactly the type of innings that we needed him to play in his previous matches in the side.

Bedtime for me I think... see you soon fellow cricket fans.,5

Rcb could’ve easily reached around 170 if they didn’t slow down so much after the 10th over,6
"Classic CSK conditions and CSK are doing well. 

Maybe things would’ve been different if they had Chepauk. Nevertheless, none of the teams have home advantage, so every team is at par.",12

Rayudu getting injured really hurt CSK early on...,9
"CSK losing a game 🤝 Winning a game

Maintaining NRR.",12

Is there any chances of the current top 3 to not qualify to playoffs rn ?,4
I'm so ashamed to walk in this thread especially after the way CSK are going,8
RCB could still potentially choke away their qualification. They have 3 tough games coming up and KKR/KXIP can both finish @16.,2
RCB losing today to continue their WLW pattern. If they lose today: WLW WLW WLW WL ....,15
"RCB also lost to us when we were bottom of the table. Maybe, Kohli is just a charitable man?",7
CSK bowled well. No doubt about that. RCB is giving the batsmen the ball nicely,12
"Said it before, will say it again. Saini is all pace with nothing else. Top batsmen aren’t gonna fall for pace",9
Saini's just Varun Aaron with a software update cmv,4
GUYS INFLATE DEFLATE DW,9
Since RCB doing RCB is still a thing in 2020.. I would be not surprised if they lose to SRH and MI in the next matches and end up playing Delhi in the final needing to win the match in 14 overs to qualify for the playoffs,16
"*Taking pace off the ball works*

RCB bowlers: I am speed",14
Fuck this shit,-1

"CSK using that MI strategy vs them. All guns blazing, and scoring most runs using boundaries",6
Fucking hell I'm pissed rn god what is happening,12
Why didn’t RCB make use of the sweep that much? CSK are milking runs off the spinners easily and constantly with the sweeps.,21

Looks like we will remain in top 2. Thanks CSK,4
"I don’t think RCB is going through, guys. Still have to play Mumbai DC",1

"RCB's bowling performance can be predicted within 1-4 overs, when they shit, they do it together",6
"Just had a revelation lads

CSK's tournament is just following the modern Dhoni innings structure

Play awfully for the vast majority of the time, to the point where you have next to no chance of winning. Then all of a sudden start doing really well now that success is almost out of reach, meaning that although you don't end up winning, your stats don't look *too* bad at the end of the day",18
Has it become easier to bat on this pitch?,1
So it wasn’t a slow pitch after all and just poor batting? Or is it pathetic bowling that’s making it look this way,6
We're going to playoffs right?,5
"CSK on fast pitches with small boundaries where 200 is par: I sleep

there's absolutely no way they're losing. batting seems easy rn. looks a totally different pitch somehow. guess csk bowled to the pitch and rcb isn't,2
Man that was close,3
Why my man Gaikwad is protruding his tongue like that? lmao,6
There goes the chances of getting into top 2,1

"AB chirping: ""It's in the back of their minds...""

Not sure if he is directing that at CSK players or RCB fans....",5
Rayudu along with Karun Nair has to be one of the best Indian batsmen in India's domestic cricket.,5
"I said before CSK innings and I'll say it again, it's not a bad pitch to bat, Koach has a habit of playing run a ball and hoping that AB will make up for it later.",10
"Unless they pull an SRH, CSK has this in the bag",10
Ngl Rutu and Rayudu are playing much better than ABD and Kohli did,4
Green day Lose day,11
"Need 64 off 60 with 9 wickets in hand?

RCB should win by about 15 runs.

 - from a SRH supporter",12
CSK won’t play any more aerial shots because required is run a ball now,7
I'm confused as to what is happening right now.,5
Surely not even CSK can lose from here,5
"It's too late for CSK, but never too late to prepare for next IPL. Looks like we finally found a decent combination of oldies and youngsters.",15
Csk taking quick singles!! What are we seeing !,8
The fielder should always throw towards Rayudu’s end. He never runs with urgency. Prime candidate for a run out.,17
"Losing is fine but this is just horrible stuff from us. Absolutely no intensity, bowlers not reading the pitch. No slips, no attacking fields. Lots of misfields. 

CSK have been really good but RCB haven't even created any semblance of pressure or tried to create any panic whatsoever.",17
Someone in comm box has to say Kohli's 50(43) was very selfish. Rounak Kapoor will strike I have hope ☺️,6
"RCB has become reverse CSK Misfields, Drops and bad bowling while CSK has become CSK",10
If we play like this in the playoffs we’ll get blown away by Mi,10
The Holding Chahal back like Narine did?,7
"Basically CSK bowled ridiculously good to clamp down Kohli and ABD. First of all it did seem like RCB were 10-15 runs short, their bowling now makes it look like a walk in the park for CSK.",13
Who usually keeps for rcb??,6
AB and Virat have to change this approach of holding on to their wicket. Middle order are professional cricketers. They’ll take over if you guys get out,10
Bruh gaikwad is fast.,14
Time to bring in Udana 🤐,5
Rayadu is actually running well today,6
I am just drowning myself with spark comments. Super upset inside,6
Thala blinded by all the spark,7
"Hey yo RCB, whats happening 😁",1
Why the fuck Csk didn't played like this again MI :),8
Saini is the most overrated player ever. Hit him a few and he will bowl beamers.,4
"I know these years Super overs have been awesome but I would have loved it even more if Ian Smith was commentating during it.

Oh man What a Voice♥️",7
Someone needs to do RCB a solid and play a Manish Pandey like innings,2
What the actual fuck is that pizza walk expo ad? Cringe af,0
Kohli and ABD must have played really slow then eh? Taking inspiration from Dhoni,0
Nothing to see here this is just our yearly csk loss  quota done.,6

Dhoni should just give his jersey to Gaikwad after this match lmao,8
RCB 30-40 runs short,8
How are CSK batting so well when everyone in RCB struggled? Good bowling/batting by CSK? poor batting/bowling by RCB?,13
Saini is all pace no brain,7
Lord Siraj to save us,8
Common siraj take a wicket,5
Oh good. More pace,4
RCB is not playing badly.. the pitch is kind of acting up.. game of small margins,-1
The pitch improved mid match,5
RCB bowlers bowling the only balls which can be hit for boundaries on this pitch.,4
The pitch actually sped up instead of slowing down or RCB bowling still shit?,2
"I wonder how Gaikwad is so fit even after being from Mumbai. All those vada pavs,Samosa and BHEL puri",2
Kohli and ABD overestimated the slowness of this pitch.,7
cameraman crushing hard on sam curran,5

So dhoni's gonna give his jersey to gaikwad today or what ?,8
Pathetic fielding,6
Thanks CSK ♥️♥️♥️,8
Two sides of Siraj in two matches he can bowl in Aus test series in both scenarios when Aus is 36-3 or 411-3. Pick your poison Indian fans ☺️,5
CSK should do ok next season as there is enough spark in the squad still.,10
As we don't have someone like Bumrah or Rabada the match looks over :),6
Yeah this was the pitch for Udana. Slower balls worked well here and that are Udana's strengths as well,13
If I were Gaikwad I'd get a big ass Pikachu tattoo on my forearm after this game,16
Yes Sunny MI is good. Shut up,14
My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined,7
"RCB's RR in 7-15: 6.1

CSK's RR in 7-15: 9.1",9
"Why doesnt RCB ever ball slow? Can't they see what's happening?

Edit : ever ~every~",1
Siraj is crap,0
Lord siraj back in form,0
"If you watched the Kohli and ABD innings, they didn’t really try to hit. They were happing knocking it to long on/off and taking singles. 

They done fucked up",8
Pitch is slow so let's bowl all the faster bowlers. Big brain Kohli is back.,8
"Rcb did a lot of overthinking for this pitch. Oh they are back, the rcb we all know and love.",7
Is this really CSK,7
What a meme team. Finds their form after it is all over. Smfh,2
"Barring Morris and Chahal, none of the RCB bowlers in this side have a brain, Saini included. They're all bots who keep doing the same thing over and over again without thinking a bit. There are some days when you gotta use your brain and bowl. Clearly a lot of these bowlers have none.",7
Aleix pace was too good for Apirila.,1
"Looks like all CSK needed was a Chepauk pitch, lol",5
Top much intent they learned something from last match don't leave it too late,2
Kohli with the look from past seasons,6
Looks like last match Siraj was an exception,7
"Good batting, bad bowling, both?",3
Only thing that can save the day is mi losing so no one qualifies yet,11
Siraj back to form,7
Blinding!!,3
Rayudu wiped after running a 2,8
"Siraj 0-29 (2)

That's the Siraj we know",20
Who are they and what have they done with CSK?,12
Gosh Rayudu seems to have added a fifth dimension to his batting,6
Siraj's figures show normalcy has been restored.,2
Was that a flash in the pan performance by Siraj?,1
Rcb hit only two sixes ;-;,2
where the hell was this timing?!?!,2
"Holy shit that was some shot, absolutely smoked.",5
Siraj back to being Siraj...and the world is back to normal.,2
They're using 4K cameras to film. Why no broadcast?,2
"I am too numb to appreciate this partnership. 

> 59 runs in 41 balls.",3
[thala after seeing spark](https://ibb.co/fdWPVxq),0
Rayudu spent his whole life force hitting that shot,1
Intha performance yenga da pochu?,1
Rayudu what happens to a wasted KL Rahul,2
Well time to question Kohli's intent today 😉. Pitch isn't looking that horrible.,12
"CSK, try not to lose.

""BITCH, I'M  PLAYING FOR NRR""",7
Sparks flying everywhere rn,9
"Unkills are spanking these kids hard, now now, will they dent their NRR?",3
That Siraj spell against RR is gonna knock RCB out of IPL,3
Rayudu taking world cup selection revenge on Kohli,3
Time to rescind Siraj's apology thread? Lol,5
Our run rate is fucked again. thanks,7
"VK and ABD are not always at their best and that is completely fine but setting them as a measure if they cant score, no one can is well not valid as they are showing",12
Wtf a 100 m six by rayudu!!,7
"Rayudu man, work on your fitness. No wonder India preferred 3D over you.",8
So Siraj was an imposter last match.,9
"Delhi exposed. 
RCB exposed. 
MI to get exposed next?",6
Those who apologized to Siraj after last game getting ready to apologize for apologizing,7
Dhoni hates Karnatakians,3
Slow pitches....we don't have those in India!!,5
RCB are so shit. KXIP are gonna do em in in the eliminator.,7
Siraj might cost RCB the tournament due to his performance vs KKR,3
">Idhar dhek bhosdike. Ye le tera spark.

- Gaikwad to Dhoni",11
How do they go from the bowling from the match with KKR to this? I was finally putting my hopes up for RCB's bowling.,4
What is RCB's record in green jersey?,4
CSK is bossing the chase,4
"ah yes, the notorious 17-7 from sunrisers, I remember it like it was yesterday",11
"So rcb got hammered by the worst team, still think they can compete against aggressive teams like Delhi and Mumbai in the playoffs?",-1
Pandey's 15(29) was the worst innings of this season,3
"Why does Gavaskar not say anything to praise Rayudu’s six? Only talk about how MUMBAI bounced him out cleverly, or how Gaikwad keeps his head straight while batting",7
"Let's bowl fast on slow pitch.

Parkour.",4
[deleted],2
"Aur zor se daalo bc.


T: Bowl slow ffs",2
CSK csk,2
Of course the only match when Siraj played well had to be against KKR ;-;,9
Koach did his usual rubbish and didn't open up the bowling with siraj and sundar.,4
"what do you tell the God of death ?

not today",2
"Guys I'm new to cricket...


Does the green team always bottle against shitty opposition or is it the first time?",13
Just RR needs to win today. And we will be officially out of 2020. May be 2008,9
Guess who's back? Back again? Lord is back. Tell a friend.,13
[deleted],9
It's just not IPL without a meme performance by RCB against us,7
Well if Raydu gets out & CSK can lose the game. I have full faith in their batting.,4
We will have a bat first.,6
This is the Siraj we know,6
Good batting CSK well done👍🏽👏🏽👏🏽👌🏽,-2
SRH management making Manish Pandey watch this match instead of letting him into the nets session.,2
Gaikwad has shown so much spark that even if we tuk tuk from here should still win comfortably,9
Csk still in it bois,1
Siraj had an off day last game and now he's back to form.,4
"Sunny G Logic - 

Gaikwad gets out cheaply against MI - why play him, at the top,  Murali Vijay should play lol.

Gaikwad showing spark today - he is the batsman, good running, good shot, good everything.",22
You'd think CSK were chasing 180 not 140.,3
Rayudu : Fuck you r/cricket for saying 3D is better than me.,7
Siraj just had an off day in the previous match. Don't worry he is back.,3
"Just an opinion, For a guy who's done good for CSK r/cricket gives Rayudu alot of shit!",16
"Yesterday on WHO WILL WIN TOMMORROW POLL commented that how tf is there votes for csk, csk fans are blind supporters, csk has no chance...

where are you dear right now",10
Goes to show how untouchable MI are really.,10
"Spark was always there.

MSD was just wearing Gucci shades 😎",23
Why is Chahal not bowling now,7
"Conspiracy theory: The green of the Pak jersey is the most natural one, so to avoid that association RCB went neon green.",3
These two compared to RCB have made the field look so open (not even counting the 6's). Its like theres 1s everywhere.,8
Has Siraj taken readmission into Dinda academy ?,0
RTG is back bois,4
In conclusion Virat has no power left in his arms and just relies on running now. Proper ODI player,14
"I think difference between KXIP yesterday and RCB today has been character showed by team, RCB bowling and fielding both are shit today with no intent",5
"What do you do when you have a wooden spoon?

You eat someone else's cake.",28
"Watching Rayudu bat like this against Green RCB reminds me of the 2012 classic where he scored 81 alongside Pollard on a 122 run unbeaten partnership, and MI chased 173 after being 51/5",21
Being a DC fan I like this.,3
This sub literally made a apology thread for Lord Siraj. Form is temporary shit bowling is permanent lads remember.,19
does csk have a chance 😢,7
This tournament isn't going to end well for RCB.,9
We chase 140 like it’s 180 and 180 like it’s 140,35
Only one who can make this game interesting now is Dhoni,5
Told you guys that you are now stuck with Siraj for the rest of the season.,3
That Siraj apology thread was typical r/cricket premature ejaculation.,20
I still don't understand why didn't Koach batted 2nd?,5
Playing so good throughout the tournament only to lose like this to spark 11,13
Kohli saving chahal for last over😁,12
"OK Gaikwad is good. Now someone get out, I wanna see Jagadeesan bat.",9
"R Gaikwad: Take this ""spark"" and put it in your a$$",10
This is literally a Chepauk pitch,21
Siraj with the fucking intent in the field what is this shitshow,4
Gaikwads playing well. I am happy for him but could we wait one match before judging him as the Lord of this realm?,6
Nelson??,1
So the pitch really wasn't that slow and Kolhi and AB pretty much exhausted themselves out by running so many 1's and 2's?,11
"SunnyG's just salty at Ruturaj because his initials are RG.

Reminds me of another disappointment in his eyes.",18
HOLY SHIT! HE FINALLY HIT A 6!,-3
MSD throwing youngsters who didn't even get the chance for the poor performance of the team.  No captain should do it.,6
Mumbai nibbas  I don’t like yall but rooting for your win today. Beat RR bad like you did to us.,4
"Damn, this CSK can't get me to stop smiling. This is lovely to see. Rutu and Rayudu have been brilliant so far.",6
Hope the spark is bigger than Nelson!,4
If Rayudu is batting well against you... well RIP in pepperonis,6
the WLW WLW WLW WLW pattern continues 😔,8
RCB can still win this if they get these two out immediately after the timeout. Weirder things have happened in IPL so this isn’t so far fetched,2
SRH boys when will we find players who play fearless shots!? Why does stupid VVS always brings mediocre players!?,2
Rayudu WANTS that time-out after running a double.,1
"For people saying apology threads backfire

There r meant to be.... It's r/cricket jinx at its peak",5
"can Csk pull a Srh :""v",8
That thread which claimed RCB will make IPL final if they win with green jersey . Is it still available or deleted ?😂😂😂,6
"Pitch : slow. 
RCB spinners : Im gonna do an Afridi",11
"If the IPL were held at home, CSK would have definetly being in the top 4. This match all but answers that. They need to hope and pray next year's IPL is in India.",4
"111/1 in 13.

I'll go out on a leg to claim a long 2:30 Timeout for a certain Shepherd.",2
Siraj should upgrade with himself with batting skills like Lord Shardul. Or else he will quickly become obsolete in this format of the game,3
What is with the 7:26 start time?,3
We need a complete and total shutdown of apology threads on r/cricket until we can figure out what the hell is going on,12
"Get 5-6 men inside the circle and save singles ffs! Having 5 men back in the outfield makes no sense. 

35 to win off 42 with 9 wickets in hand is a walk in the park.",5
"Horrible bowling from Sundar. What's the point of darting in balls towards the pads when you need wickets? Disappointing man, smh.",3
How consistent is Ambati Rayudu for CSK? He's been pretty good everytime I've seen him.,1
"CSK is eliminated , correct?",2
I am waiting for CSK to pull off a SRH.,-1
💥💥💥💥💥,1
"If CSK chases this down in 18 overs, how much would it dent RCB's nrr?",4
"Guys, fire crackers are banned in my city. My question is that has Gaikwad shown enough spark to allow me to use his batting highlights as an alternative on Diwali?",11
What demons were RCB looking in this pitch while batting,9
You know if RCB implode in their next few matches they may not even make the playoffs.,4
"So we lost yesterday, RCB on the cards today. Aap chronology samjhiye",5
Gaikwad increasing his ipl run tally by a cool 900% so far this innings,10
"Siraj getting tonked. Finally, inner peace.",6
CSK didn’t bowl one half volley or one short ball to RCB. No room given whatsoever,5
"I still think RCB is all Kohli and ABD. Get both out for cheap, and the team will fold for 100.",5
Scenes if CSK loses from here.,2
Will somebody make this match interesting?,1
Where tf is chahal,2
Siraj had to go for runs. His economy was coming below 9. Need to get back to 9.5.,3
Kohli and Abd should get an award for making everyone to think that there's something in this pitch,12
"Shit in most games and suddenly puts in their best performance of the season against us to damage our chances of top 2, fuck CSK.",12
Excellent innings Gaikwad! Wish to see you in CSK for years to come.,6
Trump and Bolsonaro loving all this spark. So much spark climate change is accelerating,8
Even in their worst year CSK find a way to humiliate RCB lol,19
Udana could've bowled well here,4
Koach probably thinks CSK will automatically shit the bed like SRH last night. Piss poor bowling and overall set up.,8
"Honestly, as a CSK fan, I'm happy about how we've done this season because of this match.

After last season I knew this season would be bad (didn't think it'd be this bad though) because we only made playoffs last season because of Dhenier and bowling department. I wasn't looking forward to this season. 

Now I'm actually looking forward to the next season, I feel we'll do well.",11
csk should look to chase this in 15 overs,2
"On a serious note though. 

Rayudu _could_ have been our #4 in 50 over cricket. He bats really well as an accumulator. Just needed a longer, maybe much longer rope. But well, time wasn't really a friend because we needed a solid team by 2018 end.",2
Don't know why I suddenly think of David Shepard standing on one leg for 111,5
"So disappointed with kohli’s batting overall this IPl. Apart from his 90(52) , I don’t remember any remarkable batting performance. He struggles to hit boundaries. F this crap man , he’s overrated",1
"Let's face it, RCB were 20 runs short when batting. About 10 profligate when bowling.",2
He went to take a shit guys...give him time,5
i think kohli was tryna fool csk by making it look tough to bat but looks like they didnt get fooled,3
Kohli seriously needs to rethink his strategy in middle overs after this match. He has the lowest strike rate among top run scorers this season.,5
Lmao Rayudu off to drop some logs,6
"Chennai are the most vulnerable in the last few overs ,they need to finish a little early if they were to win",1
Kohli should bowl. This pitch will suit his style of dibbly dobblers,2
Rayudu went to take a shit?,11
Rayudu: ight imma head out,7
Apparently Rayudu's gone for a shit,16
Wtf am I seeing? Is it even the same pitch or RCB's bowlers are bowling shit tier or is it the captaincy.,3
RCB better bowl out their best bowlers now.,1
"Batting first

Playing slow . 

Don't even try to hit 
 
Bowlers bowling fast in slow pitch

Not playing Udana in slow pitch

Giving singles easily

Giving fast bowlers over in middle overs rather than spinners. 

Yeah pre - planned lose",7
"Rayudu gone to poop, and commentators talking about what he could possibly be doing lmao",7
I think what been happening in todays game I what csk expected before the IPL began.. To get teams to score 150 or below on slow Chennai pitch and have a player bat a decent innings and get 8 out of 14 wins and make it to playoffs and try thier luck out there.. Csk might finish well in this end part of the season,2
"I know we hate the timeouts and it often ruins the momentum of teams. But in this heat , I'm sure alot of the players would love a cool break!",2
*tatti Karne gya hai Rayadu*,5
Y'all are shitposting here but there's that one guy working out probabilities for CSKs playoff chances. May the force be with you mate!,5
Mumbai will hope this RCB turns up on Wednesday.,1
I see this 111-1 happening so often.,3
"RCB being the meme team, losing to only the last point team.",2
106m six jeez,2
Kohli is terrible as a captain. His field placements are puzzling sometimes.,1
"Collapse in one match = blast off in second

Doesn't depend on bowling lineup, look at kkr and csk",2
Could see the uncomfortness in his face after hitting that six. Lmao.,3
Rayudu using strategic timeout for shitting literally,8
Rayudu went to do a Renshaw?,1
Well I really thought this pitch wasn't easy to get on with.,2
"Finch isn't in the team meeting, isn't scoring runs, why he is in the team again?

I thought they bought him for his help in captaincy.",3
"Ever bat so good you shit yourself? 

Rayudu has",10
Commentators trying to talk around the fact he went for a shit,8
"Rayudu aur iski jhaange. 

He's unfit asf.",1
RCB supporters: Saala yeh dukh kahe khatam nahi hota hai be?,2
"I made the prediction that RCB would lose against CSK and win the title, but I was not being serious about losing to CSK FFS 😳",3
I hope he wiped his arse after shitting. Must be in a hurry,0
"Two quick wickts and a team like CsK will collapse under weight of  self doubt.



Make this match interesting fuckers",1
And people were asking RCB to declare at 110 runs stage. Lol perfect /r/AgedLikeMilk material,11
"Rayudu's pee break turned into a ""fuck !!! where's the TP""",7
What is he talking???,4
Few pounds lighter,9
Apparently Rayudu went to take a CSK in the toilet,6
"AbD yapping into Rayudu's ears lol.

Wicket coming soon.",8
Sam Curran best all-rounder of the tournament,2
"My man Rayadu taking a dump on the toilet and RCB both in the middle of the match
 Edit:
And gets dumped on first ball haha",6
"Pet Safa, aur yeh Tej Bhaaga",4
never knew players can do that,4
Ugghhh they’re talking about a player’s bowel movement on live tv and cracking jokes about it,3
"Imagine the RCB dressing room when Mike Hesson praises Kohli for making 50(43) while he goes on liking tweets of Eng Analysts saying "" Kohli was Selfish"" "" Cricvizz says Kohli gets negative points"" 😂😭😂😭😂😭",7
"He shits when he wants, he shits when he waannnts

That boy Raydu, he hits old people and thinks he's tough",5
Lmao abd and rayudu talking about toilet,3
"The fitness level is so unprofessional with this guy it's unbelievable. One six he hit dancing down the pitch and he is pulling up his muscle and shit...

Good riddance from ODI team.",5
Gone,3
111/1 strikes again,2
Get fucked. Back to the toilet with you.,0
Rayudu break didn’t help,1
Didnt finish it last time,1
Raydu kar ke nahi aya,3
Rayudu needs to go back to the bathroom,8
Please Dhoni come on this is the right time for you!,3
A sliver of light for RCB,2
Rayudu's six straight to the douchebags who think that knowing the owners entitles them to a VIP ticket during a global pandemic.,6
Collapse coming up,2
Rayudu literally and figuratively shit himself,3
Rayudu took his time just to get out,1
Yup held him too late,1
The stark difference between CSK and RCB fields is so evident. The ground seems more open in the second innings,1
AB and Rayudu smiles confirmed that its a nature call.,3
4D chess by rayudu to finish his shit,6
Match will get interesting now. Anybody’s game now,0
LOLLLLLLLL Chahal didn't bowl after the 8th over. Koach masterstroke.,3
4D move by anti 3D to bring Jaggi in..,6
 Curran pls,5
MI's team looks so much better than others that it almost seems unfair,6
Rayudu shouldn't have dropped his lucky poop.,3
Happy for Rayudu. Nothing worse than coming out with an incomplete shit,10
"Yeah, all i want to see is jagadeesan's batting
Edit: FU thala",2
Ah I already see RCB winning this,2
Please don't collapse like srh,2
Maybe he was batting so well cause he was holding it all in.,2
It’s time for Dhoni’s tuk tuk,2
"Rayudu can now go wash, to be crude :p",3
Virat Kohli had the same strike rate that Gaikwad has. r/cricket just picks a scapegoat and sticks with the scapegoat the entire time.,12
I am gonna lose my shit if Dhoni or some oldie comes now and increase rr. Send in jaddu or sam and effectively end this in 2 overs,10
"He needs to clean up properly that's why he got out, not because he's rubbish",6
Definitely got himself out so he could get back to the toilet,4
Thala 12(30) incoming,3
Will we see an SRH type collapse today too?,1
CSK gonna lose this one as well,1
"If he had waited a bit more, be could've gone now",2
"Oh no!!

We are taking it to 20th over.",7
Oh comeon Dhoni! We wanted Jagadeeshan!,2
"Rayudu should have held onto that pile of shit, was his lucky charm today clearly",3
Guess that poop was the reason behind Rayudu's spark today,1
Chahal's fiance is cute but I think they can both do better,-2
Abhi toh haag ke aaya tha vapis hagg diya,3
Lol tuk tuk Dhoni is in. Watch game go to the final over,0
So it was shit performance by our batsman.,2
Dhoni will bring the game to the last over,2
Please send Sam or Jaddu.,2
Could have gotten out and then gone to the toilet,3
Thala!?,1
"Called it boys!

Shock and horror",3
Wtf why Dhoni?? Send in Jaggu 🤬,4
It would be peak 2020 CSK to shit the bed and lose this,11
Into the tail.,0
"**13.3** Chahal to Rayudu, OUT, big shriek of a YES from Kohli as Rayudu sweeps all around a full legbreak. He is bowled neck and crop. The off stump gone. Chahal comes back and creates a chance. Who would have thought? **113-2**

AT Rayudu  b Chahal 39 (27b 3x4 2x6) SR: 144.44",4
Dhoni batting with spark.,1
Only way RCB can win this is if Dhoni comes in to bat now,4
Thala is here🔥,2
What if that Shit was csks lucky charm? 😳,4
Lara is boring af,0
"Very good six from Rayudu today, best shot of his this season",1
"Rayudu probably flushed away his spark in the break, and as a result, got out.",5
"Dhoni has come now for winning glory, hasn't it",1
Rayudu got out because he forgot to wipe his arse. Now he will do that in peace.,1
Rayudu: DOMINOS!!,1
I wanted to see Jagadeesan but good to see Dhoni come out and face his weaknesses head on,2
Should have brought in Sam Curran,2
Dhoni out there to see the spark close up.,4
Lunge forward defence incoming,2
Fasten your seat bells. Dhoni has arrived to take this to the last over.,10

Dhoni against Chahal. Omg not gonna go well,3
thala is our only hope now,11
gaikwad don’t get out at 49 please,3
That wicket was 👨‍🍳👌,2
This is stil fine from Rayudu. Rather get out upping the rate than playing an 80 SR innings,2
Time for Dhoni to come out to slow things down I see,6
Did Rayudu need to take a shit lmao?,4

Dominic Cork pronounces 'Ambati Rayudu' _perfectly_!,6
I just can't finish it in 4-5 minutes. I atleast need 15-20 mins to feel I am done. I would feel more uncomfortable if I had to shit and be done in 4-5 mins.,4
Dhoni congratulating spark,6
"50 for Gaikwad

Sparkling knock. 

Maybe too late for this season but is gonna be regular feature for future hopefully",3
Good innings from Rituraj.,2
Well played Rutraj Gaikwad!!!,3
"Hats off to Gaikwad after the previous failure and publicly humiliating comments from his captain, need a big heart to do what he has done here",3
Why Dhoni? Why not Jagadeesan? Perfect time to show Spark,7
Gaikwad going near dhoni to show that spark lol,7
"Well played young man, I eat humble pie.",2
Gets 50 while Thala is on the pitch.,8
"My hate for Dhoni is intensifying.

He doesn't send Curran to finish things.

No sends himself to get some glory, and yet gives a chance for CSK to lose because how terrible his batting is.",6
In your face Thala,2
"Lmao hahaha Brian said "" Is it good sending Dhoni to bat now there will be dot balls"" instantly Dominic Cork going "" Wooooo"" knowing he can't say this in Star broadcast 😂😭😂😭😂😭😭",23

Gaikwad finishes it off in style!,8
Dhoni's ass is sparkling,3
HE ENDED THE F ING MISERY THANK U GAIKWAD,2
"Gaekwad : Fine, I'll do it myself👅😛",6
GAIKWADDDDD,4
"Less go , jumping to the mi vs rr thread now, see u bois",4
SPARK,6
Gaikwad finishing the match with dhoni beside him this is the spark.😍,10
💛💛💛💛💛💛,4
"Good game by CSK. 

On the hindsight, Jaggi is today's Kedhar.. Nothing to contribute to the team today :D",7
SPARK,4
fireworks! look at those sparks flying!,3
"Thanks CSK, Yellove",7
Hits a winning six in front of Dhoni. Lol,11
This is something new and better!,9
Sparky boi,3
"Thala bhosdike, dikha sPaRk ?? - Gaikwad probably",10
Hows that for spark?,0
"Otha, win pannitonda!

T: We won :')",9
"Ayyy, shitting on dhoni for his ""spark"" comment is back on the menu bois!",6
"Gaikwad,the real finisher",6
There goes our top2 chances,5
Good guy Gaikwad.,8
Is this the first time we will be able to watch toss of second match on a double header day ?,3
Gaikwad finished it before Dhoni could take it to last over.,7
Today we saw a big spark in CSK,4
Thala tried best to take it to superover but no support from other side,8
Biggest getaway of this match is the overrate. Match over at 640. That’s a miracle,9
Srini Mama please make csk qualify bro.,5
"What a spark. Gaikwad ends it with a 6, not Dhoni who came ahead of Jagadeeshan for no reason.",4
"lame  


freaking  


lame",2
"You know why Rayudu is playing well in this partnership with Gaikwad?

Because he has 3D glasses protecting him from the sparks.

*Shared the same thing on FB and got a sum total of 0 likes; don't let me down r/cricket*",2
That bois is fucking I N T E N T.,6
Cleared the way for MI to remain on Top 😎,5
0.09 nrr :(,6
Finally CSK found Watson replacement for next season too.,8
RCB finally playing like we expect them to. Batting carried by Kohli and ABD only for them to lose the match with their bowling.,4
Gg guys. Hope this sets us off for a good 2021,12
Dhoni memes Gaikwad into form.,13
"Impressing Mahi by hitting the winning Six, nice",4
Gaikwad future Thala confirmed lol,5
That was not SPARK...that was FIRE.,10
"Rutraj, did well with the bat and a few catches as well.",6
F You RCB F off. Can’t expect anything from you,4
"That is seriously good innings from Gaekwad.  He must have been so tense, like he was about to be hanged, when he started his innings.",7
RCBs performance today is a textbook example of what can happen if you take the opposition for granted.,10
"GREEN RCB JERSEY IS CURSED. 10 matches, 2 wins, 7 losses and 1 no result (Courtesy of Cricbuzz)",4
phuckk itt,1
Hope this restores CSK confidence,4
Once again bowling let us down,3
Wtf nehraji still saying if csk gets 12 points they have outside chance to qualify,2
Even 170 wasn't a good total in the end. RCB read the conditions wrong.,14
"Never read too much into pitch conditions, one out of the box innings can fuck u in the arse, and Gaikwad did that today.",12
"Even at our absolute lowest, a victory against RCB was inevitable :')",36
Thala: No ruturaj you cannot just do that!,3
"Atleast it was the sparkling youngster that beat us. I'm happy for that.


But boy am I furious at the bowling choices wtf was happening it was totally random",3
"Gaikwad seems like a decent, uncomplicated player",12
And gaikwad FINISHES OFF IN STYLE!!!,3
"to hell this spark bs, i aint gonna appreciate any csk spark idc",1
Hoping MI lose today,4
Was it all the overs of spin that made this match end hella early?,1
"Is there a timeline where the top 4 are MI, DC, KKR and KXIP?",9
Fuck that green jersey.,7
"Gaikwad Finishes off in Style 
Gaikwad to Dhoni: *yeh main kar leta hu aap jake Dream 11 pe team banao*",14
"Got downvoted for writing RCB didn't bat well. I was right though in the end, easily short by 20 runs.",17
Idiots,1
RCB now 2-7 in the green kit,6
"DC being Shit . RCB being more shitter. Not it's Mumbai time .

It has been tradition in this IPL. If one of these three lose , other two do same thing.

Time to lose Mumbai",14
So is anyone gonna talk about how slow rcb was batting on this pitch,8
Green jersey W/L ratio undisturbed.,3
RCB getting trashed and sParKed.,2
Congrats Chennai!,8
I would like to thank RCB for the memes.,5
Dhoni finally sees a spark,6
Thank you RCB for ruining  what could have been a perfect day.,29
Dhoni should publicly apologize for his sparkling comment.,8
Ali for Udana was a bad move. CSK loves spin and Ali wasn't a threat for them.,11
Ee saala cup... put in the sink to wash,7
Man Koach’s kinda getting old,7
How did this game get over so fast? There was 38 overs bowled,6
Ruturaj making a statement by hitting a 6 to finish the game in Dhoni's presence 😂,15
"Sorry but whats the need of these fist bumps in the covid era? Also its the entire squad of 25, not just playing 11",5
SIRAJ BACK TO FORM,17
Okay but can someone really tell me the reasoning behind the bowling choices?,8
Lol Kohli looks pissed,8
Dhoni's funda incoming. Why he came before Jagadeeshan. How he saw spark in Gaikwad last night.,9
I think Kohli's post match presentation speeches are as good as Dhoni too. He just doesn't smile as much as Dhoni.,7
"Look at me 

Look at me 

I am the Dwayne Bravo now

- Sam Curran probably",30
"RCB in green jersey 
 
M-10  
 
W-2 
 
L-7 
 
NR-1",12
Admit it. Just Admit it. Admit it mofos.,6
"DC played shit yesterday, RCB played shit today, it's time Mumbai plays shit too. Please MI lose today's match.",20
"Fuck koach 

Nice win there, CS fans.",7
Looks like it's a weekend of the top teams getting thrashed. Waiting for RR to somehow tonk MI tonight,20
Kohli blaming the bowlers instead of his batsmen😂😂😂,18
Shardul can still replace Monu and this team will be good for this sluggish pitch.,7
Hope Gaikwad continues piling it on in the domestics. Seems very textbook. Would be a solid future ODI aspect.,16
"Judging by the trend , is rr finna beat mi ??",7
Wtf Koch blaming bowlers,11
"RCB played the final whenever they won in the green jersey (2011,2016).",19
RCB didn't allow us to be the meme team 😣,21
Virgin slow pitch Kohli vs Chad Sparkling Gaikwad,30
CSK sparked and RCB spanked,8
It's like the team batting first didn't see what the other side was doing there,9
One loss and Kohli's facade of being cool and collected went for a toss,28
RCB got a taste of spark I see,12
[deleted],9
Gaikwad destroying Dhoni’s dream of a last ball finish.,3
Rcb being the Robin Hood today.Gifting points,1
The only issue RCB having is low RR in 7-15 overs and nothing else we lost 4 matches just because of 1 single reason and we aren't improving this so guys we deserved this defeat kudos to Ruturaj you played really amazing innings today!,14
Dube needs to come back,7
whats the point of bubbles and stuff if the players just mingle like this post match,0
"No one:

r/cricket: GaIkWaD mAdE a StAtEmEnT bY hItTiNg SiX iN fRoNT oF dHoNi",33
Faf is bloody jacked.,9
Gaikwad sparkling for more than vampires in Twilight.,10
we chocking bois 😭,6
"Dhoni : No Spark  


Kohli : No Expression",12
Kohli's NOT a good captain. Period.,19
who will get dhoni's shirt? I think AB,6
That performance of Siraj against KKR might cost RCB a lot more..,22
Wow Gaikwad really showed Dhoni by playing well for CSK. I bet Dhoni's gonna be pissed.,12
Comeon we just lost one and everyone is acting like r/cricket.,18
"So, not jinxing it or anything, but is it possible that RCB do not make it to the playoffs? You know, for the memes.",9
What did RCB fuck up? Batting or bowling? Fielding was definitely shit.,3
Hope kutti singam gets to play a game in TN soon,4
"Instead of throwing youngsters under the bus, if they were given more chances CSK could have been at least not at the bottom.",2
will the real csk please stand up,18
Dhoni fans and haters are equally toxic,24
"If rr betas mi tonight, things will get really interesting",3
Your captain can't score 5 runs in super over. So shut the fuck off,-12
"Gaikwad finishes with a six.                                                 

Dhoni : you done fucked it up!!",6
Race for top 2 is still wide open. Love it,2
the way r/cricket went from prAisINg Dhoni's statement the last game to shitting on him after Gaikwads performance is beyond me.,9
"So Kohli says 2nd innings batting is not true representation.

Then says 140 is what they targetted before the match

Then say they offered width, CSK bowled stump to stump.

So the fault lies on RCB's bowling? 

His chain of thoughts are so damn hard to follow man!",5
"Atleast we have solved the opener problem for next season.

Fan and Gaikwad looks a really good combo. And with Raina back next season hopefully we have the balance we badly lacked this season

Faf / Gaikwad / Raina / Rayadu or Jagadeesan 

Dhoni / Jadeja / Curran / Chahar / Thakur / Indian spinner / Fast bowler from overseas with decent pace 

Just need to find a good overseas seamer and decent Indian spinner and should be a good side for next season.

Let go of Jadhav Karn Shamra Chawla Watson Tahir and Hazlewood and should have enough purse to buy the players we need in auction. Could even get someone like Root to come in at no.4 and bowl a couple of decent overs of off spin",10
We are not last! YAY,17
"Missed first innings, why did RCB bat so slow? they were not all out.",4
[deleted],2
"LMAO all of you cry for Dhoni""s head, he knows he gotta look for one less player in the next auction. 

He's the last person to care about other opinions lol!",23
Kholi should try to find occasional boundary in his first 30 balls. planning to accelerate after a 40 ball 50 will not work every time.,14
I N T E N T   vs   P R O C E S S,18
"Obligatory ""called it"" comment

>RCB start as favourites but have a distinct like really really high gut feeling that CSK will win the match, Jadeja/Tahir and Karn (if he plays) will choke the runs out of RCB in middle overs I feel.

"you didnt have to stoop so low

now you are somebody  that i used to know",12
"Next Auction RCB: Siraj is lonely we need another fast bowler to strengthen.
Auctioner: Lord Khaleel sold for 10 crore to RCB",27
"Fucking hell Kohli really? Except Siraj's shitshow today, and a few bad deliveries, the bowling was actually pretty decent, by RCB standards. If only there was SOME logic behind the bowling (it's easy for me to say, I know. He's the national captain, I know), but this bowling attack didn't seem composed at all and looked like they'd lost all hope by the 10th over.

And the batting didn't accelerate at all. I'm very disappointed. Once again, I can only hope it was an off day for the captain and the team. I feel like the Pakistani fan after the wc match against India. I just can't",12
"lets be honest we all saw this coming

we still arent good enough to confidently beat csk",20
i'd still root for RCB in the RCB vs DC finals.,6
"DC did some disservice to multiple fanbases but CSK helped reduce some frustration from yesterday, now if RR could produce some fireworks",12
[deleted],-27
Wow you guys really have a way of taking post match presentations literally. Kohli meant CSK bowled well and thier bowling today wasn't a reflection of what has been happening this tournament.,8
Didnt watch the whole game. What rly went wrong today?,8
"Side note, but Curran being the best bowler today? Who'd have thought",2
Neroli Meadows👌🏽👍🏽,5
"Virat: There is no such thing as a strong team. It all depends on how well we do on that particular day.
MI: Am I a joke to you?",18
I hope MI plays Lynn to spice the dead rubber,2
Oh god. Now I have to tolerate csk fans bullying for 2 days.,22
"I am pampered by KXIP matches.The matches are so dull,The same match would be a thriller in Indian pitch and 2019.",7
"Man people here really really hate CSK, don't they? It's not fun.",55
"RCB next 3 fixtures: MI, SRH, DC 

DC next 3 fixtures: SRH, MI, RCB 

I hope both teams lose their next two games so that their H2H clash will be a virtual quarter final.",14
"If KKR win even one match, CSK is out",9
How much is a lakh?,9
"LOL those credit stealer jibes against MSD.

He hardly does that.  I agree his fans do and maybe egged on by a few experts too. He hardly says he did good on his best of days. He handled the transformation of a shitty 2012 India to the most glorious 2013 with an entire new look team, which remains our best year last decade.",46
r/cricket can get really toxic when it comes to Dhoni. It's not cool.,56
"csk: bowling slow because its difficult to hit on slow ball 

Rcb : lets ball as fast as we can",41
Sad that RCB lost but it was a good game by CSK,27
RCB has best batting team this IPL but for ODIs 😆,10
"Okay.. too much criticism for Dhoni today from my side. The good ones: Gaikwad, the bowling unit",2
Dammit I missed the last 8 overs and the postmatch interview. How was it? Other than csk winning and a 6 by gaikwad at the end?,15
"After the super over weekend last week, this could be the weekend where the top 3 lose. Let's see what happens to MI",14
Wow we are still top 2 after yesterday. Disgraceful!,-33
Where can we catch the postmatch presentation?,10
[deleted],87
[deleted],-21
"Dhoni being pragmatic and saying they have to enjoy the remaining hours they are around. And a nice speech about Rutu, his Covid struggle, walking into a losing team, batting out of position, batting when it was tough. Kudos to that young man!",22
Kohli playing exxtra cautiously is pretty bad sign for India,18
[deleted],3
"Finally real CSK did stand up.

✌️✌️✌️",17
"Should say dhoni was very gud in post match interview today.. was pragmatic and said not to think about complex mathematics .. talked about just enjoying the remaining games.. praised Ritu too.. talked about ritu s struggles with covid.. after the ""spark"" comment this should do a world of good for the youngster's confidence..",25
For RCB fans: Join the discussion at r/RCB,3
I thought Curran would be awarded MOTM for 3 important wickets. He has been good this season. He performed with both bat and ball,16
Isuru Udana would’ve loved this pitch. Bad move kohli.,17
Missed the game? Why did RCB lose? :(,3
"Kohli: You only have a limited years to play cricket, so better invest those few years on your health.


Saurabh Tiwary: Got you.",5
"MI ki batting ka saara bhaar ab Saurabh Tiwary ke pet pe hai....


*(see what I did there)*


MI batting's entire weight is on Saurabh Tiwary's stomach...",6
Pollard average dropped from 200 to 100,5
Tiwary is chonk af,1
CSK can still make it but fixtures nee to go their way for sure. LIke MI must beat RR and SRH for sure.,2
"Looks like I was right

https://reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/jhdqjz/_/g9xxake/?context=1",4
That could have been the match for RR,6
"Wow, Tiwary put on a lot of weight. Dude used to be ripped",11
"Guys i didnt rly watch todays game but my mom did, she doesnt know much about cricket but after watching the fielding of rcb she was convinced the match was fixed. Was it that bad?",2
Very depressing defeat this for RCB. Can't take away even one positive from this game.,13
"Ben opening again! Bad management!
Edit:
Wrong thread",15
Now Dhoni should eat up his intent comment,14
This is where IPL rules over other leagues even though Stokes had a quite tournament now he's performance will be talking point all over the world. Where you don't hear when someone like Jake Weatherld or Josh Inglish in BBL win a match.,1
