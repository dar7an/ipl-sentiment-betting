In Smudge We Trust.,4
"Here praying for an upset but realistically speaking, RR have literally zero chance against CSK even with Smith playing. 

You see with CSK, it's rarely ever a violent loss like you could expect against say KKR where Russell comes out and pummels you into submission, but it drains you bit by bit. You start off thinking you have a chance and then hope drains out 1 bit at a time and in the final over, CSK somehow win. 

Good fucking luck RR. Gonna need it.",52
CSK going to get found out one of these days.,6
"According to me ,RR playing 11 will be like

1. Manan Vohra
2. Robin uthappa ( I doubt they will include yashahvi against csk)
3. Sanju Samson 
4. Steve smith
5. David miller 
6. Riyan parah
7. Tom Curran
8. Shreyas gopal
9. Mayank markande
10. Jofra archer 
11. Ankit rajpoot/ kartik tyagi",3
Is this match thread seriously for a match that‚Äôs not on for another hour and a half?,1
"I am just here to watch one Curran bowl to another Curran and get the wicket. What's the point of this match, if that doesn't happen.",10
Why BOT has RCB flair ?,7
"Guys, I‚Äôm scared",2
Mandatory Pom RR fan checking in,88
Tom Curran vs Sam curran . Their battle will be legendary,50
Do you think Dhoni can still run like he always did?,4
Stokes has been underwhelming in the IPL after that one season with Pune.,11
Why doesn't RR improve their Auction game? Why they wanna save so much money,2
"In CSK's last match, we had Deepak Chahar vs Rahul Chahar.

This time, will we see Sam Curran vs Tom Curran?",18
Never quite forgot the hype leading up to D'Arcy Short's debut in 2018 and how he did absolutely fuckall that season and then disappeared.,8
"I like RR because of Smithy and the younger Indian guys, but today's going to be a tough match for them without Jos and Stokes, Jos will be available next match but likely Stokes misses the first half of the tournament, and they're probably going to be banking a lot on those U19 guys which might not work out so well like SRH implosion yesterday",8
"Battle of young guns vs Old guards.

Will they be able to break them or old guards will school the young guns, let's find out in next 4 and half hours.",10

"Given the way things have gone this IPL so far, Rahane would have walked right into this RR lineup. 

Hindsight is 20/20 though and the year is also 2020, so you can't do shit except whine and curse the management.",19
Time for thala Dhenier to destroy RR with a 0(3)* this time.,49
Back to this sub! Hope the trust in young guns works out! HALLA BOL ROYALS! ‚ô•Ô∏è,5
I wish there was a lot less focus on Dhoni in these pre match stuff.,5
It's a shame we don't have crowds in the stadium this time...can't forget the absolute bobs and vagene level shithousery that went on in the match thread the day that red RCB chick showed up on the television screens. The kind of stuff that only r/cricket was capable of delivering.,4

Archer v Chennai !,2

Where's u/SalivaForThalaiva when we need him/her?,9
Hol up RR have fans?,4
If you're an Englishman and don't support RR please hand in your passport,53
looking forward to two best test batsmen fighting it out in a t20 today,3
jaiswal and another opener?,2
RR stands for RandiRona /s,4
">Barring Buttler, none of the other Royals batsmen had a strike rate of over 120 against spin last season

ooof, that's quite a big fuck up in IPL terms right ?",11
"I hope Smithy is playing on his own today not because of pressure from the management. Until day before yesterday he was not certain in playing 11 , now all of a sudden he is available to lead and play ...it's ok if he misses a couple games and comes back fully fit rather than playing with doubts.",3
RR have the worst indian team on paper,4
Will tom curran play? If yes then very likely to see sam v tom sometime in the match.,7
Smith has been a little bit off lately based on what I saw in the Aus-Eng series. Hope he does well today.,-1

Archer

Unadkat",0
"Unadkat will have the best figures today!

RR without Buttler looks like SRH with VIJAY 3D SHANKAR,6
"Excited to see Markande. 
Hopefully he plays alongside Shreyas Gopal.",0
wonder how players are avoiding sunburns. apply sunscreen spf 50 >>> sweat buckets >>> roast skin.,0
KP looks like he was in a washing machine with a RR jersey and it bled over his face.,2
"Can we even trust the r/cricket match bot since it identifies itself as an RCB supporter? 

What if it fudges the numbers and spreads misinformation leading to eveyone believing RCB actually won ipl2020? Very sus. ICC should investigate.

he is not 100% lmao. Rayudu getting ducked again",-3
"A 23 year old playing for CSK?!

Blasphemy.",9
Great no Rayudu :(,2
Wtf happening with sound I can't understand a thing,2
Massive home ground advantage for Samson. Borderline unfair.,16
"Why are the captains distancing?

Aren't both teams in bubbles?",3
"You know those questions on r/askreddit about what superpower you would choose if you could? I'm convinced Dhoni chose to win tosses every fucking time.


Dude rarely loses",1
This RR team excites me. Always love watching an underdog to see if it can punch above its weight.,6
How long has it been since we've had an indian youngster in the team? I don't remember if Shorey got a match last year or was just sub fielding all through.,3
Archer and Smith playing as mates. Feels weird after Ashes.,5
Jaiswal did ‚ÄòNamaste‚Äô to MSD. How cute :),8
"Statistically batting is the superior tactic on win % at this ground, seems weird for csk to bowl. Dhoni is one of the best limited-overs captains of all time though, not in a place to criticize him without good reason.",4
Weird how we had our school annual day at Sharjah cricket stadium about 15 years ago,6
No homo but MS looking like a million bucks,5
Bairstow has to be one of the biggest IPL bargains auction wise,10
"If RR wins, Goenke(?), the RPS chairman will be creaming his pants. Smith vs Dhoni",3
"Rather than playing this cliche VR developed on ms paint, they could have played cricket 19.",3
RR and SRH are the only teams with the overseas captain right?,6
"UAE is cursed boys!!

So many injuries?! Rayudu the only guy who looked good for CSK got a niggle.",4
Jaiswal looks like he should be prepping for JEE Mains in Kota or something,73
Kedar Yadav should get a chance to bat.,1
Yeah Vijay vs Archer is going to look straight out of a Carry On movie,5
One day where they needed to win the toss and they lose it. Jesus take the wheeeeel!!,1

Who sits out once butler is available? My guess is Miller.,4
Smith looks like he was punched by some school kid XD,5
Archer is goona eat vijay alive,24
The team looks really balanced!,6
"A team feels rayudu is unfit

N vijay gets his chance

Have we seen it before?",5
Why no Rayudu?,1
What‚Äôs the role for Murali Vijay ? He can‚Äôt play fast and can no longer anchor the innings . Wasted slot . Same with Jadhav if he is not bowling and batting at 6 or below . I would rather have Jadhav play anchor and other power hitters around him.,3
"Curran brothers are playing against each other , interesting battle",5
"All I want from Vijay today is one cover-drive for old times sake, get out immediately, and let Watto and Faf carry the team",5
Guys I have an exam tomorrow .. should I watch or study?,-6
"Hold on, a game where both Curran's are playing and not carrying drinks? 2020 is fucking dank.",110
"At this rate by the end of the tournament, the team which would be able to field a healthy playing 11, would win the tournament.",4
Robin Uthappa and Murali Vijay opening feels very 2010ish.,2
Why is sky sports still showing the replay?,3
Yesterday Lord Umesh and we have Lord Unadkat today. Lord Dinda proud students.,3
Just play a youngster instead of useless Vijay.,1
"For everyone saying Royals are depleted, Their batting doesn't look half bad. If Jaiswal can do what Paddikal did yesterday, they'll score 180+. They have enough power in their batting to clear short boundaries here.",4
Dhoni flossing ad followed by Selmonbhoi swag ad. Might as well die.,9
"Excited to watch  Indian's finest wicketkeeper after a long time. To hail from a small state, unknown for producing cricketers and to see how much he has succeeded in his cricketing journey. It will be a sad day when he retires. All hail Sanju Samson.",7
yeah hi just tuned in why tf is csk playing vijay and not rayudu,2
Uthappa‚Äôs career may have been rescued by the move from the high scoring Eden Gardens to the lower scoring UAE pitches. I think it will really suit him so hoping he can go well today!,3
"Why do my fantasy league players never reach the starting XI? First Tahir, then Mujeeb, yesterday Morris and today Rayudu. Tho today was my fault I shouldve known he was injured.",3
"Near the end of 2015, Miller was averaging 44 with SR of 148 in the IPL. Now he's averaging 33 with SR of 139. Drop off is pretty bad.",3
Put the redbull logo from the shoulders to the front and boom we have the perfect jersey! Loving the colors but spoilt by that TV9 logo,6
Really excited for the Unadkat that led Kerala to victory.,7
Tahir would be shaking his head right now . Anyway we can get him on the match thread instead?,1
"Pink makes so much sense for RR, why didn't they have it from 1st season itself.",5
"Who's keeping, Uthappa or Samson?",5
"I backed Rcb last match n they won

Teams need more fans like me",-1
"I hope we see a fresh Uthappa today, He became too comfortable and lost some fire in last two ipl. Rooting for him.",1
[deleted],4
"my god smudge's neck looks long there, guillotines dream.",8
Dhoni's goal this Ipl is to make the weakest team possible and still win the game.,11

"They gotta stop romanticising Dhoni like that tho, I mean the man doesn't care about it but let him be, I love seeing him as much as any fan out there but shoving ads like that just makes me cringe.",3
I am surprised with the lack of lungi branding by csk,0
"I want to see more Jadeja batting, is that possible in this life?",2
I just want Jaiswal to succeed . What a inspiring story this guy have .,4
Am I watching star sports or dhoni documentary?,1
Sharjah  has smaller dimensions than the other two venues,1
"RR jersey looks like a litmus paper

One side dipped in acid n other in base",3
Uthappa and Jaiswal looking like a father son combo,11
I'm supporting the team that Curran plays for,7
Lol Uthappa couldn't look older compared to Jaiswal,0
Man remember when Vijay was good in like the first 3-4 IPL‚Äôs.,2
Chennai have to have the oldest Top 6 in professional cricket history.,3
If Unadkat brings his Kerala form then RR looks quite solid. Tewatia and Parag are great spinners,1
Bring your kid to work day: Uthappa and Jaiswal,3
Is smith opening?,2
"People are not expecting much from Royals, especially in absence of Butler and Stokes...it's understandable but I hope young lads surprise us all. 

Youngest side at 26 vs oldest side CSK at 36 , a decade less experience, hope Smith brings best out of them.",8
I wonder if Smith had a more memorable name he'd be rated higher (Bradman or ponting are awesome names),5
Smithy opening,1
Oh no Smith is still concussed he thinks he's an opening batsman,58
I don't think Dhoni dyed his beard and hair. The 400+ days rest did him good.,4
Yayyy Smithy is opening,4
Can't wait for Sam Curran to alpha the entire RR squad,1
HALLA BOL ROYALS ‚ô•Ô∏è,2
Rayudu benched or injured,0
Damn Smith opening,1
Young guns vs Dad army,1
Smudge opening for all us aussies who just want to see him bat and go to bed.,15
Smithy is opening!,1
Yo I‚Äôm digging this Jaiswal kid‚Äôs long hair,2
"when did Jaiswal grow his hair, is he the new Dhoni",1
Uthappa is a waste of a spot. I don't care if I have to eat my words. He was in the cricbuzz panel last year ffs.,1
Smith using his power of captaincy like a good school cricket captain,5
"First ""What"" for today",0
Yashaswi Jaiswal definitely was social distancing without going to the barber,1
Yesterday was dev today Jaiswal,-1
Smudge Opening? Does that mean Uthappa is our designated finisher?,2
fucking tv9 logo.. disgusting,4
C‚Äômon my Royals!,0
Yashaswi good luck kid,1
The only way you get to play for CSK is if you are old or a young lad who has historically triggered the entire nation of India...,5
Smithys opening,2
Dhoni has given up on his beard,2
Yashasvi bhava to the young lad,1
Rajasthan Jersey looks ugly as fuck because of the sponsor logo,4
"TF was that surprise, mister Devereux?",6
do Brits support RR with Smudge at helm?,6
My man Dhoni I love you but wtf is that beard bro,-4
Go Jaiswal! HALLA BOL ROYALS ‚ô•Ô∏è,4
Let's Pledge to not shit on the kid please.,8
Finally we have an Indian Gayle üòÉ,1
Why isn't rayudu playing?,1
"Play nice boys, I want no injuries today. Injury plagued league doesn't rhyme well",2
Jofra <3,3
Smith surrenders his no 3 role to legend Robin such a humility.,6
Hopefully this Jaiswal doesn't turn out like Shaw,3
Jaiswal looks like some kid from the central coast,2
So curious to see what Jaiswal has to offer :),1
Dhoni malfunctioning,1
is Jaiswal vs Paddikal the next big thing?,9
Chahar swiinnngg,1
"Oh I remember this guy from the u19 World cup. So jealous that IPL franchises aren't afraid to give young guys a chance, BBL sides are cowards for that. Would make BBL so much for enjoyable for me if we played more young guns",42
Confident af! Yes!,2
Haha cheeky smiles all around,2
lol KP just shitting on Chahar,4
That shot was full of confidence,2
Hoping Jayaswal does a Padikkal today. Although supporting csk.,0
So is Jaiswal a Rahane?,-3
"Is Chahar a realistic test chance? You‚Äôd love to see him in England with a duke, hooping them around.",6
Why can't Sanju open??,0
[removed],4
Running down the wicket on your debut ball. You have my attention Jaiswal,5
"Really excited to watch Jaiswal.

Confused as to why Smith's opening. Uthappa's like Rahane should open or not play at all",8
Smithy opening wow!,1
RR's jersey looks like what the parents would wear at a gender reveal party for their non binary kid,33
Remember when Koach was the U19 sensation in the first IPL and how utterly out of place he was made to look in his first match. The new young players look way more at ease in comparison.,4
Wth is jofra doing there,-1
So we will see Miller at 4/5,-1
Smith's shuffle to the offside gives me alot of anxiety,11
Just want jaiswal to be better than privthi,2
Smith‚Äôs flicks are soo good,2
"Given the stadium screens are almost entirely there for us telecast viewers, does it bother anyone else how badly the refresh rates are mismatched?",4
Smithy going to be opening for Australia instead of Davey or Finch before we know it,9
"RR Jersey looks a bit nice, save for the horrible tv9 logo",3
So who's gonna get injured today in the injury premier league 2020?,1
Umm why is SPD opening? I thought Robin would open,0
"Padikkal was amazing last night pumped to see how jaiswal goes,this guy can really play!!!",1
Can you feel the makes things happen factor,0
Had to look up on google to confirm that Jaiswal is not a girl.,-8
"I got no answers earlier so here I am asking again 

Is Jaiswal a Rahane or Pant?",-1
"Did Curran, Archer and Buttler not arrive together?",1
"Godamnit! It's fucking weird, as a Brit, cheering for Smith.",8
What is that camera angle,8
"Smith opening to play through the innings as an anchor, so no collapses? 
They could've opened with 3 other batsmen who've done the job more often, so a very interesting choice, love Smithy tho so no complaints",2
ground is small af,1
Did it become daylight suddenly?,1
I liked the blue RR jersey. A completely pink jersey would've looked classy too. This one hurts eyes,1
Petition to call CSK-RR as the war of Curran‚Äôs,0
This outfield is very small compared to yesterday's. Chinnaswamy feels,1
"Every team should be alloted/have different primary color. There are 3 teams with blue jersey. Like i get it, its ""Indian"" premier league but calm down with the blue.",1
Square boundaries are so short lol,1
I wish the camera angle was higher. On both ends to be honest.,2
Sam Curran makes me giddy.,3
"Woah, the ground is ugly",4
Why does the ground look very tiny Bois?,1
The pitch looks insanely slow,1
The quality of the Hotstar broadcast blows,2
Sharjah seems to be a much smaller ground compared to the other two grounds.,4
"Headband gang : Curran, Jaddu",2
Why'd the camera angle switch?,1
The outfield looks like shit.,6
Vijay get your long hair again,1
Just checked in. What happened to mah man Rayudu??,2
I don't understand why Smith is opening. Surely he is going to drop down anyway when Buttler returns so why open now??,1
Makes things happen klaxon,3
"Taking bets on send-offs if one Curran gets the other out. Both gobby, both shithouse, both Surrey. It's a tricky one...",7
Hot take: Smith will sore 800+ runs this tournament,1
Feels weird watching Smith not wanting him to get out,2
"Is it just me or does this ground really look 
fucking small? I think we could see a few 220+ totals here",4
"The audio mix is shit on Sky Go, can barely hear comms",6
Mark Nicholas and KP commentating together... brb while I shove a screwdriver through my ear and into my brain,6
Chonker super kings,2
The small ground looks smaller with that angle. Are they playing in a backyard?,4
Vijay playing for Chennai? * Surprised Pikachu face *,1
What a smol boundary,6
"Average first innings winning score here is 178, the highest of the 3 UAE grounds. RR will need to rack them up tonight!

(166 Dubai, 155 Abu Dhabi)",3
Low camera angle on this end is... Not bad. Gives a better sense of the pace.,-2
The camera work is fucking terrible.,6
Gayle could get a double-hundred on this ground,1
Have people here never seen Sharjah before,6
Royals are history,-4
Boundaries are what like 50m?,2
Are these the same tents where ball used to land when Sachin and Saurav used to hit sixes for fun ?,7
Ugly batting from smith there,4
does anyone else think that the camera angle looks a little wierd?,7
Conspiracy theory: El Chapo escaped from ADX Florence and ~~is~~ now bowls Leg-Spin^^^^piyush ^^^^chawla for CSK.,2
Fucking open with Tewatia and get 60 in 6 overs,1
Smudge panicking already lmao,2
"Looking at the size of the ground, I can't wait to see Watson's awkward mis-timed shots to clear the boundary lmao",2
It's tea,2
Such a bad camera position while the bowl is being delivered,4
"Curran's bowling is ridiculous. Not very fast, no swing, little bounce, yet he goes for 3 runs in the over.",7
Any problem with audio on star sports?,1
Not used to such run rate against CSK. Usually it‚Äôs like 10-30 in 2 overs.,1
Did something happen to the camera angle?,3
Smith looks rusty.. understandable.. would have preferred him at 3 and Samson opening. Nit too much experience for RR in the middle.,1
"Royals need Jaiswal to become a star, they have the worst group of Indian players",2
"RR squad looks pretty solid, might end up in playoffs if they play their cards right",3
Saurav dada's hindi doesnt really sound like one spoken by a Bengali,2
tbh I may see dhoni endorsing stuff more than batting this whole season,3
Curran (Tom & Sam) brothers have played together in 105 matches in senior representative cricket (FC + List A + T20s) before today. This is the first time they're playing against each other.,9
Vijay looks like Southie villains sidekick,2
Yashasvi bhava!!,2
I knew it,2
Paddikal & Ruturaj both were not selected for U-19 world cup team now both of them mainstays of their franchise,1
YEASSSS GO CHAHAR,2
Need to get Jaiswal out quick,2
RR has the weakest batting side of any team,1
Oh dear.,2
Bruh,1
I mean the pressure must be immense on that kid,5
"Tried to check Smith‚Äôs stats while opening in the IPL. He‚Äôs never done it before. 

Tried to check for T20‚Äôs, also no.

Turns out this is the first time Smith has opened in professional cricket!",56
how much did royals buy jaiswal for?,-1
Where is the noise bitches.,0
They need to sort the audio mix out,6
Chahar wanted some dream 11 points. It was MS catch otherwise,5
This ground is good. Can score 200. Wish Punjab played most of it's matches here,1
Thanks for the commentator's curse Irfan.,8
Even though the ground is smaller pitch is very deceptive,0
It's ok. First match and he looked really nervous.. will see after a few matches what kinda talent he has..,8
"Fellow Brits:

Sam Curran on strike, Jofra bowling. 9 needed off the last over. Who do we want to win?",20
Smith if not a middle order batsman then this is a really unbalanced team here. If millers plays decent. Joss should replace smith. Give captaincy to joss.,-4
yikes.  that was ugly from jaiswal.,-5
"First time Smudge is opening in FC, List A or T20 cricket (496 matches)",10
"That's how you avoid a collision, *ahem* SRH",10
Oh noo was looking forward to watching Jaiswal bat :(,5
should have let dhoni catch that,5
Jesus. The camera work for the Qld premier grade streams I watched last week was better than that...,8
üîàüîäüîä AYOOO LOWER THE CROWD EFFECTS,9
NICE GOING BOYS,1
Which team is going to play the most matches on this ground?,1
"Rusty, very rusty. Rusty Rajasthan Royals..",2
Good thing Dhoni pulled out last second,6
[deleted],-2
"**2.2** Chahar to Jaiswal, OUT,  **11-1**

Our side is literally so sad without Buttler lol,9
Batting order looks weird,0
Wait a minute - There is a Riyan parag and then Priyan Garg? Thats confusing  :D,8
Atleast yashasvi didn't look jittery. Hopefully plays better innings next time.,7
The stress on an 18 y/o must be quite high. Maybe he'll perform better over time.,30
Mullet is out (of fashion),2
DC had himself in his fantasy team and wanted extra points,10
typical RR start.,8
Lungi is everywhere on field man,5
Omg I've never seen Dhoni smile this much during a match :'),8
"come on smudge, bat yourself into form",5
Jaiswal with helmet low key looks like young MJ,5
"Will this be Sanju Samson's year, part 5?",106
Weird to see Smith open and Sanju at 3 and not the other way around,3
Shot,2
Deepak chahar surely loves caught and bowl,5
Realistically what's the chances of RR winning this?,6
Who we opening with next match ?,2
Bowling short to an Aussie. üòÖ,8
In comes the man for whom whole india rooted to play in place of pant and went for duck very first match,5
It's taken me ages to clock that the reason why Rajasthan are presumably called the Royals and why they have such a heavy English presence is because they're owned by a British Indian with a few British co-owners,8
Lol bowling short to Smith,2
the aesthetics scale for a pull shot is between a yjb and a smudge,2
That left arm of Chahar üëåüëå,2
Smithy helping himself to that short ball,1
"Hell yeah Smudge, show them why you average 65 in the real cricket and this hit and giggle format isnt enough to faze you",-3
Holy fuck this crowd noise is horrible,8
Samson has bulked up substantially.,6
Why isn't uthappa there? afaik he used to open/3 for KKR,3
Hope Jaiswal gets opportunities to play even after Buttler is back,5
[deleted],4
Wtf is that name of the car? S-presso lmao.,3
the crowd noise is weird but total silence would be weirder,7
Chahar is a pretty good bowler,1
Keep Bangar away from Dugout. All the fun and banter gets lost.,5
"Steve Smith is mumbling under his breath. 

""That's just our Smudge, he's an odd one.""

Steve Smith is rocking now. The clouds are darkening, winds are changing. A figure looms in the distance.

""Yup, that Smudge is a weird unit""

His eyes are rolling back. The rivers run red. Nearly done now, the sacrifice of a child is all that's left.

""Don't mind Smithy, he's just a bit peculiar""

Sam Curran is missing. The incantation is complete. The Eldritch Abomination, Labuskagne√´, has arrived. CSK don't stand a chance.",25
Smithy putting a short ball to the boundary and not getting hit by it or hitting it to backward square leg. Crazy,6
I heard that Sanju Samsung uses an iPhone,15
Rahul Dravid and his awkwardness on the car dekho app is just so me.,6
"I‚Äôm not gonna say shit, I don‚Äôt wanna fucking jinx anything",4
what a tight slap to six.,2
"Wait what, did Smudge just hit a six off a new bowler?",4
Exquisite timing,6
What a shot !,6
Shut up Bangar. You are making us sleep.,6
this feels like a preseason game for some reason,3
"RRs core is foriegners, that cant be good. Smith, Jofra, Stokes and Buttler.",4
"Kohli in first ipl game 14(13), smith in first ipl game 15*(12), Smith > kohli confirmed",24
Dont be testing Jaddu lol,1
ooof steve smith is something else,2
Unacademy Cracking Tissues,3
75 Meters is a six on most of the cricket grounds,3
Buttler will have a field day on this ground. By which I mean he'll be hitting it out the ground and into the (dusty) field next to the ground.,4
"I'm an RR fan, but it's so hard to not want Smith to get out.",7
Very weird without the sound,2
disappointed the fake crowd aren't booing smith,10
The angle that the bat forms....................from the elbow.....................and the downswing.....................method......................wait for...............FFS just finish it Bangar.,6
"Smithy cunting the bowlers with his weird stretchy arms, you love to see it",3
Dhoni seems to be shaving with masks on.,10
FFS what an amazing shot from Smith. This guy is so good.,5

This ground is good. Can score 200. Wish Punjab played most of it's matches here,0

Should have brought a spinner here,1
Peak Dhoni would've cleared stadium quite regularly here I guess.,1

Sam Curran looks like he lights paper bags of dog shit on fire and puts them on your neighbours doorstep,8
I don't think Kohli and Dhoni utilise Jadhav's bowling properly. Is it because he's injury prone?,1
"Yes Curran, keep bowling short on a pitch with no bounce and 50-metre boundaries, a recipe for success.",6
"Are RR popular in India, or not so much?",4
Fucking hell Bangar is so robotic. Up the enthu some more mate,1
This looks like the only ground where 200 will be par score,1

Sanju likes some gentle medium pace coming on the bat.,7
I guess today is one of Samson‚Äôs obligatory 2 good innings per tournament which is going to make most of the sub to question why he isn‚Äôt in India squad .,9
the crowd sound effects seem off. way off. there's complete silence on the ground (atleast on tv) and a low buzz when batters hit a six.,3
Sam Curran promoted to bat at 3 would be banter on this ground,5
Chahar looking like a half-tracker-dibbly-dobbler !a,1
"Smith's so privileged to play with Samson, can see it on his face",6
Watson will have a field day in this ground.,5

 stage is set for the mandatory trademark early ipl samson innings,1
Let's see if Sanju can provide a calm and steady role for the young fella at the other end to look up to,2
What's the logic of bowling short of length balls on slow wickets? RCB was doing it against Bairstow too last night and getting hammered,0

I hope CSK's batsmen face Archer's wrath,9

What happened to Rayudu? Why isn't he playing today?,1
Honestly my favourite part of the IPL each year is watching Samson bat. Such a beautiful batsman looks like he's got so much time. Reminds me a bit of Usman Khawaja. Beautiful technique and strokeplay but a little lazy at times. Pity he hasn't been able to put together a couple of really good seasons and make the case for India selection on a more regular basis,7
Curious case of Samson. Fires up for 2 months during IPL and goes missing rest of the year in first class cricket. Rinse repeat year after year.,2

Someone remind Sanju this is not net session. This is assault.,1
Flashback of raina's inning.,6
"Noball, get fucked",6
Imagine farming strike from Steve Smith,8
This reminds me of D'Arcy Short's 257 against Queensland on the 55m boundaries at Hurstville oval. I'm getting PTSD,2
I am absolutely loving this. Beautiful hitting,2
Does the sound mix sound crap to anyone else today ? Commentators sound muffled and quieter than the crowd sfx,2
what an opportunity for Steve to watch and learn from the best,2
Am I the only one who finds Samson hitting better than pant?,5
Enough with Pant bullshit. Get Sanju in Indian team and forget about Dhoni.,1
[deleted],6
What an over if this is a no ball,2
Free hit lmaooo,1
how short is this field wtf,2
Why did Dhoni take the bails off?,2
Piyush uncle already went for 21 in this over after going for it in 4 overs last match :(,2

Criminal!!!!,4
"It‚Äôs a flat pitch, it‚Äôs not spinning. Genuinely can‚Äôt understand why Chawla wouldn‚Äôt be chucking them in quick and short.

Yeah he might pull you for six but at least you‚Äôre not just doing the same thing again and again as if it‚Äôs going to have a different result.",6
Free hit hahahaha,6
What the fuck was that siren?,11
No ball by spinners is a CRIME,3
Lmao no ball. Fuck Piyush,2
Bowling a no ball as a spinner at this ground lmfao,10

Idk why but I dont like small grounds when this happens,5
This batting with Buttler and Stokes.,7
Wacky wacky,5
Thanks Chawla.,6
Not sure Samson rates Chawla's bowling very highly. Just an inkling I'm getting,9
This isnt Sanju Samson. This is his Cricket 07 version Senzue Zamshan.,52
That ground looks like chinnaswamy of uae.,13
Lol csk getting destroyed,8
These sixes into stands bring back happy memories of Saurav and Sachin in their heydays when India played at Sharjah üòä,6
Jesus how does a leg spinner bowl a no ball. Unforgivable that.,12
OMFG... This is a mauling. They really need a timeout now.,7
Chawla gave away 21 runs in the last game. Gave away 28 in his first over now.,3
Wtf is going on,2
Press F guys,4
"Chawla was worried smudge was getting bored, what a good guy",3
I didn't know 4s were banned,5
RR to declare after 12 overs.,7

28 run over,3
What a fucking over,6
"I'm not saying Chawla is absolutely trash ,but dude sometimes does go for  too many.",2
Didn't Chawla have some great record of being the most disciplined and not bowling a single wide or no ball across many seasons?,4
That was a beauty dear Smith,3
"Commentator : it's good that Smith's taking on free hit.
Smith : BEHENCHOD hold my test bat.",10

Sanju Samson out there with the cheat codes from EA Cricket 2007 smh,9

Should also mention my memory is shite and lasts 18 months max",5
"I'm not gay but I want to live in a log cabin in the woods with Sanju Samson. We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him tighten his ass as he chops wood, shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Sanju. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love.",4
always thought chawla was an overpaid buy. glad rr put him place. lesson for other teams.,5

expecting to see Samson behind the stumps this summer. He will clear the  MCG ropes with ease,4
Piyush Chawla's is a man who's face looks like its helplessly drowning in his own fat.,4
We will need Watson to go berserk if we have any chance at the target.,7
this match went from no energy to extremely intense within two overs,7
Just like the video game simulations,8
"Last 3 overs:
14 runs
14 runs 
28 runs",5
Imagine adding buttler and stokes to this lineup,23
"Classic dhoni would give chawla 2nd over ..
If he gets wicket , masterstroke ..if not , bowler was having an off day.

Either way no harm for dhoni.",6
Proof Samson lurks at r/Cricket: he's playing like he heard everyone say RR were gonna be wooden spooners and he's pretending the ball is a shitposter's head,5
"social media filled with , csk got saved coz of buttler's unavailability. lmao say no more",7
So glad that young desi Guns are making a statement and this is just the third match.,2
This makes me imagine a prime Sachin with these modern bats. Desert storm would have been even more devastating.,3
Time to start thinking about quantum of loss :(,2
That is 70 runs in the last 4 overs. Very poor,4
Why the fuck I didn‚Äôt choose samson in dream 11 team fffs,3
Is Dhoni not giving tips from behind the wicket to Chawla? He's in desperate need of some.,1

Something I don't see much from India on the international stage these days is spin getting murdered by our batsmen. I really wish the upcoming crop shows no mercy to spin,4
mankad is the only option left now.,2
So if chawla goes out of playing 11 then who comes in. Karn sharma or tahir or santner?,2
Steve Smith's IPL numbers are pretty underrated. He's scored 2053 runs in 73 innings @ 38 striking at a shade above 129. That's solid for an accumulator.,10
that looked out to me,8
Anything under 200 from here and RR will be disappointed. Only if they had Buttler and Stokes to finish this off.,6
Fortunately for CSK it's only Miller in next. He's not much of a boundary hitter I don't think üëÄ,3

Oh shit. Was Jaiswal's dismissal soft?,1
Why the fuck has he been given a second over,6
Why would you keep Chawla on after that last over lmao,3

Someone tell Piyush there are lengths other than the full length,6

Why isn't Kedar Jhadav bowling?,2
Oof Chawla is going to get it today,2

He‚Äôs gonna go for 100 lol,4
Please let Chawla finish his quota of overs.,7

Chawla might bring up a century before Samson does,8
STOP HE'S DEAD ALREADY,12
I just hope Dhoni gives Chawla another over so he can brake Thampi‚Äôs record if 70 runs,8
Good thing that the theory of Smith struggling against left arm spin is playing true,7
"take Chawla off jesus, he's got nothing for these batsmen",3
CUNTED^MAXPRO,2
What is going on? Lol,2
Chawla will give 100 faster than Sanju scores,3
There was more noise for the single than the six,5
Last match of Chawla‚Äôs IPL career.,3
These guys are hitting sixes for fun lol,3
Chawla is getting hammered. Probably will break some kind of record if he bowls 4 overs.,4
Is Chawla completely uncapable of pulling his length back even slightly?,2
being a mallu csk supporter i don't know what to feel now. jeez sanju,1

I feel so bad for Chawla. Ouch,1
"Seeing Jaiswal getting out early reminded me of the patience that the management needs to show these U19 players. Fully understandable. 
 
But for some reason a lot of U19 and inexperienced domestic players deliver almost instant success. The management didn‚Äôt need to be patient with Pandyas, Chahars, Kishan, Rana, Padikkal, etc because they delivered instantly. However some domestic players like Hooda never delivered despite immense patience shown to him. Wonder where SRH is going wrong with that. Garg looked so nervous and out of place yesterday and I felt bad for him. I wonder if it‚Äôs more a management problem than a player problem.",6
Chawla has mentally unravelled here...,1
Can someone injure Chawla in a minor way such that he won‚Äôt bowl any further,1
Chawla having vietnam flashbacks,1
Why is he pitching up so much!!,2
Is this Hong Kong sixes or Max Cricket?,2
What's happening Lol,1
These guys are ending a career in front of our eyes,1
Highest conceded in IPL in 4 overs?,1
Buttler gonna be carrying the drinks when he comes back at this rate,4
Umesh Yadav > Piyush Chawla confirmed?,1
Either this is a total batting pitch or Sanju is just locked in.,1
So enjoyable,1
Piyush Chawla already started contemplating a permanent move to Varanasi and starting a new life there as a sage,2
More sixes already than the other matches,2
"Smith: take off your pants

Labuschagne: okay 


Smith: take off your undies


Labuschagne: oh well. Cool. 


Smith: and Stop wearing my clothes.",8
The only positive from this humiliation is that there are no RR fans to gloat.....,2
"RIP piyush

Murdered by one Sanju boi",3

Chawla can easily break the record of fastest 50 here,2
If chawla does not take a wicket here i want dhoni fans to laugh at this decision with me.,2

Thakkali Pidhingirichi ^^^^^Tomatoes ^^^^^Squished,5
No way Chennai is winning this from here now. :(,2
Just keep pitching it up Chawla. What could go wrong?,3
Love watching Smith bat when it's not against India/RCB,3
My man Watson crashing in ground.,2
Lmao chawla 50 runs in 2 overs,2
Chawla is the imposter,7
Great Placement,4
"Haha Chawla 41 from 9, and he is playing ahead of Tahir lmao",3
That is such a good shot from Smith.,4
Don't dive Shane Watson,6
CSK age showing up in field,3
Lovely shot smudge,3
Chawla on track for the 0-100,3
Chawla ki daal nahi gali aaj !,2
Somebody switch the game mode from highlights to normal,5
3 runs away from 50,3
wtf is this ground.,2
Chawla going for orange cap as a bowler! Amazing,8
My man Chawla just going for fastest 50 don't hate ffs,3
Is Chawla a masochist,5
Chawla 47 runs in 2 overs lol,3
rR gAmES aRe sO bOrINg,3
Not Chawla's fault there,5
Fuck it. I'm downloading Cricket 07 again.,6
KP commentating as if Chawla is listening to him.,5
Samson me Mata aa gyi h,2
Expecting a wicket in this over. Poor fella chawla,2
thats an insane shot,2
STICK CRICKET BOWLING.,5
Are these the two most expensive overs in the IPL?,7
Imran Tahir will be permanent member of CSK after today's match. Lol,8
50 in 2 Overs? That‚Äôll be a record or what,1
Usually Samson has a big innings like this every season and then just fizzes off. Hopefully this season he keeps the momentum going,2
gone for 46 and hasn't finished his second over lol,3
Holy fuck is Piyush Chawla planning on breaking Thampi's record for most runs conceded?,3
Sanju playing ea cricket,3
Wow the ground is so small  teams like MI would have relished it.,4
This ground is so smol it feels like they forgot to move the boundaries after completing a women's game,4
Going to see dhoni angry on field in 2020,5
Consider me retired from 20:21 hours - Chawla,16
I dont like this outfield or the boundary length,3
Dei,2
They'll make 238 if they maintain this rate.,3
Chawla missed fastest fifty. Sad.,5
Chawla is very close to breaking KL's record of fastest 50 in 14 balls,11
"Man goes for 28..

So you bring him back lmao?! And Dhoni is saying absolutely fuck all to Chawla. Go have a word or smth. Slow down the game. You deserve this CSK.",3
"Selectors: How many T20 cricketers do you want that are capable of opening the batting?

Australia: Yes",6
"Loving the good batting but HATING the brainless bowling. 

Just don‚Äôt bowl full. You might still get whacked but just TRY something else. Just TRY",4
"Lads, even I wouldn't go for 47 off 2 overs, and I'm only 8 years old",8
So matches in Sharjah will be run fests. Extremely short boundaries.,7
"It seems like Smith is anchoring, but he's striking at 150",6
If only Dhoni had taken the review of Samson when Jaddu asked him too ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,3
"Gotta feel for Chawla, he was bowling well the other night.",1
Chawla gunning for fastest IPL fifty,2
F to this bowler,1
Piyush Chawla un power aa kattita pa,1
"Samson striking at 260 ...bravo..
Other team number 3 come and accumulate at 120,130.",2
Dear god. Chawla must feel violated.,1
RR scoring 120 in the first 10 overs. You'd imagine Buttler's going bonkers!,7
47 runs in just 2 overs for Chawla,1
Who TF is the 3rd dugout commentator? He sounds like a sixth grader trying to mumble through a presentation in front of the whole class.,3
Scenes for people who picked samson and smith as c and vc in dream 11. Your lakh is incoming,4
Imagine Butler or Russel in This match.,5
Maybe Old Bloke XI aren't infallible after all,5
"Making Chawla bowl that second over made no sense, lmao.",7
RR's game plan meeting discussion: We gonna fuck Chawla good. That's it. Meeting is over. Go back to the bubble and relax.,7
"One more over for piyush and will only be 9 from it right
?",1
This is an extremely short ground.,1
"Smh, not a six. Get him out of here.",1
Time for Jadhav's underarm underarms.,1
"That's why a beard is important Piyush. You don't look cute being beardless, you get cunted like a club cricket bowler!",4
I've suddenly found a great deal of appreciation for the restrained crowd noise of the english summer,2
"RR is the last fucking team I expected to do this to CSK , that too without Buttler.",4
Samson with 253 SR üò≠,2
MS bowl Kedar ffs! Stop with Chawla!,1
Why the fuck did i pick chawla smh,1
rajasthan royals has had the best start so far in the IPL. definitely did not see that coming.,1
And this is without Buttler playing...,2
Chawla fastest 50 incoming,1
What's the boundary size on this one?,1
"Given the ungiven run that cost KXIP the match, I'm starting to wonder...are these umpires rated? Or is Uncle Ravnesh from 4th floor balcony with a broken window thanks to cricket ball picked fresh in his vest and lungi, given an affiliate MI kit and bribed into umpiring in the ""local cricket league"" as repayment?",2
why tf r we bowling the spinners,1
Jadhav bowls his other overs surely?,1
"An Indian got slaughtered in UAE..


F",3
"After being shit for years to good foreign players leaving around later stage of IPL, this is the year for RR.",1
This match atleast gonna silence CSK cringe fans on social media for 2-3 days,8
Making sure that crowd effect isnt wasted on singles,3
Is it even possible to run 2 on this ground?,6
The ground dimensions is giving me Bangalore vibes,2
Chawla on flat wickets has always struggled.,1
Should send Watson to bowl now,3
"Ah fuck, here we go again",0
"I just looked up on Wikipedia and Chawla is just 31,damm feels like he's been here forever",3
Dhoni missed a review?,3
"Man small boundaries really depress me, I get that it's great fun seeing sixes constantly getting cunted and that there's not always the land to have big grounds but damn it hurts me inside.",4
Greatest captain ever .... My ass,-5
Ok atleast Chawla improved his economy rate,2
This ground is so small that you can score runs by batting blindfolded,1
WTF is this stadium? Reminds me of Munnabhai MBBS dialogue. Are yeh shuru honese pehle hi khatam ho gaya.,8
Samson is not stopping,6
"Ah man, samson",5
Dear lord that champions fan on the screen is cringe,7
chawla 2 overs 47 runs. RIP in peace,3
Fucking stop bowling full length ffs.,2
"If RR don‚Äôt get 220, this is a loss",2
Piyush Chawla 47* (12),6
This ground is too small tbh.,3
"Bowl shit , get banged ?",3
Wheres the tasty chak chak Express gone?,4
[deleted],2
these boundaries r tiny,3
This is stick cricket,3
Thampi has conceded 70 runs - most by any bowler in IPL.  Reckon chawla has a chance here,3
"Hey bhagwan utha le

T- kill me",3
"Kids weeping for buttler missing

Men enjoying Sanju's whambam

Legends waiting for thala test knock",6
Can we please give this guy another run in the national team.,1
the old jerseys star is using for the graphics is soooo much better than the ones they have now.,1
Chawla kept flighting the ball after that first over. Huh brave or stupid,3
This is like Rohit Sharma in full form.,3
Dhoni get some pace back in ffs.,1
How many sixes is that by Samson now? 20?,1
D R E A M 11 C H A M P I O N F A N S,6
OMG MAKE THE FAKE VUVUZELAS STOP,2
Sanju!!,1
How many matches will RCB play here ?,1
"Its not the size of the ground , those shots are hitting the stands...",7
Samson hit a 4 you coward..,1
What did Sanju smoke this evening? That is insane hitting,2
"Makes me happy cause for every run RR makes, their sponsor niine will support 9 girls with menstrual hygiene needs",14
Samson on fire today,1
Sanju....,1
Chawla almost broke Yuvraj Singh's age old record on fastest 50 in T20s.,5
[[REAL] Live shot taken from the ground of the last over! Very interesting stuff](https://i.gyazo.com/97f545bad6003432bc2c307453a5756d.png),10
Revenge of the fallen,2
"Yup, it's the one century from Samson coming up",3
"Jesus Christ, what makes it really bad is the sound. You can tell how cleanly they are smacking the bowl.",3
CSK forgot how to bowl today. Pie after pie after pie. Mindless.,2
Hello officer I would like to report a murder ...,4
Why did they cancel the match today and why are they showing us cricket 07 gameplay?,11
Demolition :(,3
Weird captaincy from Dhoni though. You'd think he'll bring back the fast bowlers given the onslaught. But he's still going with the spinners.,7
Are the boundaries tiny or is just Samson batting like a God?,5
19.04% balls bowled so far have gone for sixes.,6
That 39 will go 50 in this innings,2
"So we are witnessing the customary century of Sanju Sampson for this IPL season.

If history is to suggest anything this will be followed up with people wondering why this guy is not in the Indian squad and then Sampson getting out cheaply in the next 13 matches..",7
Wait until Dhoni surprises us all by holding himself at 6 or 7 while the asking rate is 12+,3
"Yesterday ppl were making fun of umesh for 48 is 4 overs. 

Chawla uncle is like hold my beer",5
Why bowl full after last delivery? Is this some kind of fetish for csk or some challenge? They would get extra money if they get Samson on a fuller delivery?,4
[removed],0
Spin is obviously not working. Why is Dhoni insisting on them? Weird rigidity,2
So many sixes the last time I had this feeling was for Gayle 175.,1
WHAT IS THIS LIFE? WHAT ARE THESE FEELINGS THAT I'M FEELING?,4
This is just stupid fun to watch,2
"This is me on Cricket 19, just tapping B for 'aggressive' every time",6
Lol jadeja,3
"Is it the small grounds, good pitch or just the brilliance of Samson?",4
Who will bowl for Chawla?,1
This start will make Shane Watson's upcoming double wicket maiden even more absurd,2
This is like when you figured out how to bat in EA 07 but not how to change where you hit so each ball was either forward defensive or belted over long off,3
"Am late, are Dhoni Review System jokes in?",4
Lmao wtf was that ball,3
Lmao what was THAT,5
Damn what happened to Samson? We gonna have our first high scoring contest boys.,3
Lul,1
Funny how everyone saying ground is small when it‚Äôs on par with India‚Äôs. Also Samson and Smith have well cleared the boundary,6
220+,1
"In this tournament so far:


Umpire 2 - Dhoni Review System 1",2
Seems like Dhoni has to open the batting today.,2
Jaddu is under pressure wtf is happening,6
Chennai super villagers,1
Classic Jadeja mystery ball,4
Sanju's home ground technically ....get it?,5
Bloody hell six after six,2
wtf,1
"Me: CSK vs RR , will be low scoring.

Samson and smith: Hold my dal baati",6
"Commentators keep mentioning the smaller size of this ground.

Fuck that. Most of the 6s, are 6s on literally any ground.",7
Virgin Chawla bowling same delveries vs Chad Jaddu variations,7
72 off 28. insane batting from samson.,7
This is looking like samson is playing with school kids I have loaded my fantasy team with bowlers and allrounder üòÇ,5
Well this has certainly been the Tamil Cements absolutely get fucked partnership of the match,8
Samson with 9 sixes and 1 four that is just absurd,7
DRAG YOUR LENGTH BACK,3
Why is CSK playing their 2nd before KKR has played their first,6
CSK HAS THE BEST SPINNERS SETUP IN IPL. kya?,4
The boundaries may be short but that was a six on any ground in the world... incredible hitting!,4
And why are the CSK spinners bowling in slot? All Sanju is doing is stand & deliver,9
Boundaries are tiny but the way he is hitting it will be sixes anywhere.,3
Bad captaincy from Dhoni continuing with spinners after that Chawla over,3
"Chennai's entire game is built on suffocating opponents. They just don't have the batting firepower to make 200. In most games they don't need to make anything near that, but they're toast today.

What a special innings from Sanju and great support from Smith as well.",4
This is the CSK I love and enjoy.,3
CSK is dead today. Sanju is on fire,1
Straight out the Sibley manual,2
"So much talk about short boundaries, but each one of Sanju's sixes would have cleared 99% of the grounds in the world.",10
It might be a better idea to bowl Murali Vijay than to bowl Chawla,7
The fuck was that,2
"CSK have run out of prune juice, now all their OAPs have cramps and can't win games.",1
"This is carnage, but naive to think Watson and Faf won't give RR the same treatment",8
Beautiful hitting from Samson out there. And Steve Smith is probably the best person in world cricket to have at the other end because you know he isn‚Äôt giving up his wicket easily.,19
What's the average boundary size?,3
Be a dream 11 fan or never watch cricket again. Pick one?,5
Get in the pace it's ok they're smashing anyway fuck pls out,1
Smith's going at 150 and Samson making him look like Dom Sibley on Day 1 of a test,11
Who will cover Chawla's 2 overs lol,3
[removed],-3
CSK actually looking flustered out there. Come on boys,3
Dhoni bringing back Chawla was a stupid decision.,9
So this is how it feels,2
Can Chawla cross the 80 mark?,5
"looks like medium pace might be the best for this wicket, dare I say we may see a watto over?",2
Someone tell Dhoni that Kedarlitharan is in his team,7
Mumbai Indians were probably giving unnecessary respect to Piyush Chawla.,6
"Chawla with a good shot at the record of 0-70 here:

[https://www.iplt20.com/stats/all-time/most-runs-conceded-innings](https://www.iplt20.com/stats/all-time/most-runs-conceded-innings)",5
You wouldn't get turgid bowling like this in the Blast,10
"Samson 9 sixes and 1 four - I have never seen someone outside of Gayle, Russell and Pollard who have such stats in an innings",7
"The concussion had no effect on him, you cowards!",3
He might actually break the most 6s record,3
Chawla is dead today. I'll slap that channa masala ass if i see his face again,9
Harbhajan must be the happiest guy lol,3
Time to bring back the Pant I'm in danger meme even though he doesn't keep wickets for India anymore.,1
[deleted],15
"I can‚Äôt even be mad as a CSK fan, I know we‚Äôre fucked this is garbage bowling but this is some serious hitting from Samson",2
200 actually looks like a par score here,2
"This is going to be a really good game. Chennai have the batting to chase 200+ targets. They bat till 10. Watto, Faf, Thala and Jaddu. Should be a good chase.",4
Why is Dhoni setting the field? Samson is hitting over them!,3
What is the most sixes record in IPL,4
A tad bit late to replace the spinners CSK,2
"Ah man i am very sad that i didn't picked samson today, very costly mistake",2
The only way CSK is chasing this is if Watson or Faf or Dhoni play an absolute blinder. I reckon they'll promote Jadeja or Curran as a pinch hitter at the top.,9
Kkr fans rn would be on the floor laughing,6
Nice Jaddu,1
Are we gonna talk about nigidi niples,15
Oh no unnecessary,2
Jadeja falling apart,4
"F in chat for me pls

I removed Samson from my fantasy team for Yashasvi",4
131/1 after 11.2. CSK to win by 4 wickets.,2
Rr will end with atleast 210-220. Any chance for csk to chase this? Considering rayudu not playing as well,1
Cut Samson's hair. It's the only way,1
Yeah don‚Äôt take the chance cuz he‚Äôll give it to you for free.,1
jaddu getting restless,2
Whistle ~~Podu~~ Velai Ceyyavillai,1
Is that shirt sprayed on?,3
CSK with overthrows because of course lol,3
Wouldn't mind seeing the average meterage of all these 6's,3
RR haven gotten under their skin now.,4
Real cricket in easy mode,6
[deleted],3
That was stick cricket stuff with Chawla bowling,2
"Imagine thala coming at 3 in the second innings and start smacking sixes ...

.
...

.

.

.
Okay stop imagining",1
Have no doubt that I will take watching CSK finishing last over anything else.,3
The thing is all of the sixes have been effortless and beautiful!,3
Unleash Kedarlitharan . NOW.,4
They should let kedar do his underarm bowling to stop this,6
Is it me or CSK's jersey way too tight near the chest area?,14
[[FACTS] Lovely photo taken of Jaddu talking to Chawla after their respective overs](https://i.gyazo.com/a86b6c160b6fda4ab4ef62d9277f4626.png),4
The boundaries are too damn small freaking 65m for an ipl game,1
CSK jersey looks like it's specifically designed to show off the player's nipples,8
OOOFFFF,2
THERE IT IS FUCKING FINALLY,2
:(,2
AHH FUCKKK,2
FUCK,2
FYI peeps the sound is much better on dugout commentary,3
thala' s sheer brilliance,5
He has given it away! It was a wide!,2
Ok 170 max now?,3
Well played Sanju.,7
My man Ngidi.,3
"Could've so easily not hit that.

It was so wide",4
OHHHHHH YESSSSSSSS FUCKKKKKJ YESSSSSSS,3
Shit gets wickets,6
Wow.  Hotstar on my roku is 2 overs behind.  Back to PC it is.,6
Fuckin finally,2

Love you Ngidi, the saviour.",3
SEND OUT JOFRA YOU COWARDS,8
What an innings,1
if we get smith out we can bottle them for a little bit,1
Finally. YES,1
I think csk is done for today.,2
"No, he deserved the 100",7
"Finally, well played Sanju.",3
That would've been a wide had he left it.,3
Do you reckon it‚Äôs hot guys?,3
RR less than 200 now.,1
Shit gets wickets‚Ñ¢  ~~Patent pending~~,6
That was some innings. Cheers to samson,5

Great catch. Well played Samson,5

Lol still no Robin,4
"Perfect platform to move Miller up the order, really",8
Miller should be next,5
"Just yesterday RR were prime candidate for wooden spoon for this year. Dummy ""experts"" will still dismiss them. Wait until they unleash Archer, Curran, Gopal. Probably the best bowling lineup in IPL.",3
Ngidi‚Äôs smile is one infectious smile .,8
Will Kedar make his bowling debut today finally? After 81 IPL games,4
two quick wickets and we are back in it.,5

Who jinx it ?,4
Looks like a pacers pitch  archers eyes gotta be lighting up now,1
Send Miller,2
Phew. At least they won't score 250 now.,3
Sanju Samson Take a bow,3
After seeing this carnage I fear for Unadkat,5

Then I saw them hideous kits.",3
Imagine if stokes or buttler was coming in now,5
This is pure carnage by Sanju. Wonder what a purist stroke maker Butler would've done.,5
Now for Hobart Hurricanes legend David Miller.,3
Seems like everyone sweating heavily. Hope they have energy till end,2

How long before a commentator utters the golden words *killer Miller*?,3
Among all this chaos by Samson no one has noticed Smithy closing on a very good 50..,2
Would be interesting to see CSK's pitch map where they bowled and which ones gone the distance,2
Miller's ipl sr is below 130. Wtf,3
Time to try out Samson instead of Pant for the national team . ODIs and T20s both,2
"The legend has it that every time Smith scores a century he adds an extra idiosyncratic tick to his mannerisms. It's not a medical thing, he just adds the tick to commemorate the event.",4

He's out,1
Out,1
Not much depth in the Rajasthan batting,1

Oh shit I think that could be gone,4
Killer Miller in the house. RR don't let this start go to waste now. 200+ is needed,2

That's out,2
Wow I just started watching and 2 wickets in an over after what seems an incredible innings by Samson,4
He lost his bat?,2
Miller couldn‚Äôt mix it up With Pro smith,3
"FUCK YEAH, GET IN BOYS!!",3
FFS,3
Hobart Hurricanes legend is run out.,3
This has to be some new sort of low for Miller.,5
Honestly without Ambani rayudu the csk line up loses the teeth....would be interesting to watch this run chase,3
Oh that's terrible luck,7
Rule no1: Don‚Äôt take a second run at Sharjah,15

Was a bit unlucky bat got stuck,17
"His bat got stuck!!

That's just unfortunate.",4

fuckin csk are now gonna win this,2
WTF lenskart ad... Lmao,1
Miller‚Äôs last innings this season,6
This was the only game my boy miller was playing since next game butler will be back :'(,5
Just need to remove Smith and CSK would probably restrict them,4

So many unfortunate dismissals every match lol,1
Collapse time,3
"Miller just a C grade Ben Stokes, fight me",5
anything less than 220 is a crime,1
That's exactly the luck CSK needed. Now CSK have a chance to restrict them under 200,1
So wtf is supposed to be the par score on this wicket and in this stadium? 250?,2
"The only people I feel who can pull a second run with ease at this ground are Warner, Bairstow, ABD and Dhoni.",2
Watch Robin uttapam slow them to a crawl,3
"Ok how about we meet in the middle, we still have crowd noise but its taken from The Sheffield Shield, so they'll just be a smattering of applause from time to time.",1
uthappa bouta waste 5 overs hitting singles let‚Äôs go,4
What's up with these consecutive wickets each match,2
"At least 220 please, I  want to see how long dhobi will hide.",2
Samson and pant be competing for X factor,2
Oothappam inüòç,2
"The problem with Sanju was never talent, it was the CONSISTENCY",3
"Even without the bat drop that's terrible running, Miller wasted so much space when turning to come back for the second",2
WTF I thought Robin Uthappa had become a commentator,2
Tuk tuk Robbie!,2
"Hindi commentry is such shit ...they steal keywords from English commentry.

Show some creativity folks.",1
Looking at this middle order makes me cringe for SRHs from yesterday even harder,2
Can't wait for a glorious Uthappa 15(19),4
Damn they couldn't find another picture of Robin?,1
"Just like that, CSK are back boys",3
Is ben stoakes playing?,2
Now Chawla will look million dollars,3
Chawla bowled a dot ball.,3
"Why are people blaming Smith? Miller would have comfortably reached, if his bat hadn't slipped!",4
Uthappa lol 10(15),5
Did uthappa change his name for this ipl too?,2
"Smudge was going for the 2 the whole time there, dont know why miller thought different",4
Been some absolute comical dismissals so far this IPL.,3
Uthappa will now suck out all the momentum that was there.,10
Missing sanga in the dugout,1
Anchorman is here,1
"190-200 should be the final score, I reckon. With Samson, it could be 220+",2
Bat got stuck? Wow,1
Wait so Sharjah has drop in pitches?,1
momentum shifting,1
"Ffs, this is bowler u should whack. Samson should have been more patient.",3
"For RR's sake and for everyone that's watching, I hope Uthappa has left his momentum sucking innings behind after last year's disaster",3
Now uthappa would suck the life out of this game and will make chawla look like rashid.,5
Utthappa with chutney is very tasty,2
well played sanju. now do this once every 3rd match and like also make some runs in the other matches as well.,1
if steve gets out it‚Äôs gonna get ugly,2
If only Sanju was still here to feed on the remaining Chawla pies T_T,3
Did I just hear a WhatsApp web notification?,10
Wow. Didnt know Uthappa has moved on from KKR.,4
Everyone sleeping on Jadhav actually being on camera for the first time,12
Wait its tail already? Is this SRH in pink.,1
Did whoever's piping in the crowd noise at the ground just get a notification,4
Chawla lucked out here could‚Äôve gone for way more here,5
perfect time for a gusty 30 off 26 by Uthappa,3
So basically Miller ended his only game in the season with a diamond duck.,7
They dare bring Chawala again right after Sanju departs? Lol,3
What's par here? 180?,2
**Sanju** **Samson** scored 58 of his 74 runs in fours and sixes.  He hit only 1 four and 9 sixes! Strike rate of 231.,3
Utthapa gained weight too,2
"You know Sam Curran's going to win this, right?",4
y play uthappa,1
everyone telling sanju to do this every couple matches  as if kohli is out here consistently hitting,1
"If msd does the stumping, you just blindly go for the third umpire.",0
Good guy Robbie improving Chawla's day.,2
Fifty for Chawla,3
With joss probably coming in next match. This was millers only chance to impress.,3
"Very simple solution to not get out - ""Run faster""",7
"Around 10 years back I regularly used to visit a barber for hair cut. We used to talk a lot about cricket, he always use to pronounce Uthappa as Oothapa.",4
Uthappa making Chawla look like top bowler lol,8
"Has anyone used up the Miller-lite joke yet? If not, I'd like to claim it.   


Miller? More like Miller-lite amiriteboiz lezoooooo!  


\*high fives himself.",5
Somehow watching Chawla bowl is making me crave Biryani.,2
Someone using WhatsApp Web on comms. Recognise that notification sound anywhere,8
Damn it!! I really wanted to see Miller bat,4
Uthappa to ensure they reach 160,1
Piyush Chawla looks like he should be packing 2 plate chole bhature and 250gm jalebi in parcel for me.,1
Did anyone else hear whatsapp web sound?,8
"I missed the chat during Samson rampage. How were the ""Pant vs Samson"" comments?",7
Dhoni cursing himself for dislodging bales,3
Just run fast KEKW,2
Uthappa looks thicc,5
Is RR trying to emulate SRH or what,2
Can we stop going to the 3rd umpire when players haven't even appealed?,9
"**Most 6s in a T20 in UAE**

Rakep Patel 10 (2013)

Chris Gayle 10 (2018)

**Sanju Samson 9 (2020)**

Hazratullah Zazai 9 (2018)

Glenn Maxwell 9 (2014)",9
Chawla's bowling the same length to Uthappa and getting dots while Sanju was hitting them for sixes,3
Oh my god the third umpires name,6
i rememer chawla getting hit by strauss and swann in the tied match in world cup 2011,5
"Are you an overseas big hitter?

Yes 

Are you making your debut for RR?

Yes

Uthappas tuktuk just cost chawala fastest fifty in IPL,10
50 for Chawla. Well played. Off only 18 balls,9
50 for Chawla,4
Half century for Chawla,1
Samson was hitting these balls for six.,5
Congratulations on a well earned 50 Chawla.,5
Swanny actually being low key racist while being paid by Indians rn.,7
uthappa should've retired 5 years ago already.,4
Well played Chawla.,3
Chawla for Man of the match. What a bowler!! Nice comeback,4
Damn uthappa still playing cricket.,2
Uthappa's last IPL innings: 40(47),6

Sharjah is definitely the coolest of the 3 grounds. Actually looks like it‚Äôd be a great place to watch cricket,2
why that dude have cake on his face,1
"50 up for Chawla in 18 balls

What a knock champüî•",5
50 up for my man chawla,1
"Udemy, Unacademy, Unadkat, what the shit!!",5
"Wow  13 over and 3 fifties 
Samson 
Smith 
And chawla 
Lol",3
Chawla gets his fifty too,2
Chawla took one ball less than Samson to get to the milestone,2
Chawla with 18 ball half century,1
Chawla losing fastest 50 record because of Uthappa,7
Uthappa is a really stylish batsman too. Imagine him and Samson batting in tandom both on song! That'd be something to watch!,3
"Wtf is Uthappa like the IPL Shoaib Malik? Has a multi-generational career, I swear. Saw the boy play in IPL since I was in second grade and still going at it post-HS",8
Piyush uncle milking some dots from the new batsman.,2
"upvote for Chawla's 50

downvote for Samson's 50",10
Fastest half century of IPL 2020 : Piyush Chawla,9
"Are these Rajasthani fans on zoom, paid actors??",2
"Samson: I scored 50 off 19 balls. 
Chawla: Hah, I scored off 18 balls",7
[deleted],9
Smith needs to accelerate against the spinners now,6
"Uthappa is like, let‚Äôs bring the RR of RR back to their usual RR.",10
Uthappaa was shit for kkr too. No idea why RR bought him,2
The funny thing is that Tewatia was our highest and second highest scorer in the 2 practice matches and he's yet to come and the only person who cannot bat in our lineup is Unadkat,3
RR should go from pink and blue to pink and black and represent Bret Hart properly.,2
I didn‚Äôt get the memo why are bashing uthapa,1
"Smith needs to give clear instructions to Utapa to go after the ball, out toh out.",2
why can't these guys just smash some sixes?,3
Chutappa needs to retire,6
RR don't really have much batting after this. Another wicket and they're fucked,2
"If miller is dropped after buttler returns which is very likely

Miller will have no stats to show abt ipl 2020.

Ball faced : 0
Runs : 0",11
That's some unibrow in that BCCI official,2
Uthappa be like lemme try and hit some sixes as well,1
Curran lol,3
FAF needs to teach Curran,9
"The Royals have enough batting to justify Tom Curran being listed at eight, and Smith anchoring superbly at the one end, and Uthappa's walked in and nudged his first six deliveries around",19
Faf would have swallowed that!,8
SITTER TBH,8
Curran failing to pull a Faf.,8
Yesterday's hero Today's Villian,7
Put Faf there!! FFS,6
"Too easy for curren, won't take it",6
7 runs in last 2 overs. RR are committing same mistakes as RCB yesterday. They atleast had ability to catch up later.,7
Lovely fielding Sammy,6
Sam Curran is no FaF,5
not u curran,3
"Now that, is a six that wouldn't have happened at any other ground.",8
Ooffff,1
"FFS If the owner of the illegal online stream i am watching would KINDLY TURN OFF HIS FUCKING WHATSAPP WEB on the same pc he's using to broadcast--that would be nice. He/she appears to be going through some kind of long distance, marital dispute and I am tryna hear the fake AI crowd arahhhh",25
FAF would've caught it.,4
That should have been taken,3
Curried away nice.,7
Curran has become Kamran.,4
Smudge with some rare luck today,3
Why was FAF not there,4
So RR got rid of Rahane and brought in Uthappa?,8
Second time Jadeja denied Smith's wicket,7
School boy stuff from a school boy looking player,4
Faf would have caught that,3
If only it was faf,3
"**9 or 9+ 6s in an IPL innings**

Gayle - 6 times

**Samson - 2 times**

ABD - 2 times

Russell - 2 times

Gilchrist - 2 times

McCullum - 2 times",20
Jaddu mad.,1
"Definite chance there, second chance they‚Äôve missed on Smith",3
Faf would have caught that,4
why was that ball boy inside the boundary,10
"Sam curran paying back aussies

For YJB running warner out.",3
Duplessis would have caught that,3
We want more Chawla!! #biryanipower,10
Wait Sam Curran can commit mistakes,9
Should've gotten under the ball instead of getting to the side of it.,8
Uthappa filling in Steve's boots.,3
"That was a tough one for Curran I think.

He could have done better but I don't think it was a sitter.",6
KP defends bad fielding because he's been there many times himself,12
RR need to make atleast 220 here considering they have Unadkat as one of their death bowlers.,9
Smith needs to farm strike like he is batting with #11 on last day of the test match.,8
CSK spinners exposed without Chepauk dustbowls to protect them,2
Another brilliant Unacademy Maximum,3
yesss smudgyyy. just keep tuk-tuk uthappa off strike plz.,3
Faf would have caught that without his hands,16
Sharjah is such a nightmare.,6
CSK have read the pitch wrong. Should have played an extra pacer.,6
Uthappa playing ODI,6
"for the last 2 years, a staple of kkr has been the openers getting a fast start and uthappa coming in to slow the innings down to a crawl. glad to see nothing has changed with uthappa except the team",14
Should have sent tom for pinch hitting,6
That's what happens when a 4'11 12 year old is put on the boundary,27
Imo csk don‚Äôt have the batting to chase big totals,6
"CSK will be lucky to get anything under 200.
Hoping for dhoni masterclass.",2
Is Lord Unadkat playing today?,3
Where was FAf when you needed him,3
Uthappa is really frustrating to watch,2
Stevo Smitho has to bat till the end.,8
CSK will win this...boundary too short,5
"Honestly today is the day where Murali Vijay has to prove himself. Best opportunity too. Can‚Äôt find a better place to bat than Sharjah this IPL. 

Same goes for Watson.",5
If Ngidi performs well here maybe they can finally get him clothes of his size,15
Uthappam 5(8) is exactly what CSK needed,5
Kadaikutty Singham is still learning. Give him a break.,8
Thats perfect Curran. Thanks!,7
"This is some NRL level of umpiring. Team scores a legit try, and the ground ref goes up to check if there was no one offside before the game start",2
watch uthappa suck out all the momentum from this innings,8
Why no Rayudu today?,6

50 for Chawla. Well played!,1
If that were a normal-sized human with normal-sized hands it would have been out.,7
considering csk batting lineup anything above 180 will be hard let alone 200+,1
Chawla's economy rate dropped by 6.84 in the third over. Is it the greatest drop in the third over since the beginning of this format?,6
I'm not giving you ¬£69 (nice) for something that looks like a quid you nonce,5
CSK should play all their matches in Sharjah,-1
leak runs is okay but don't drop catches in T20s,1
Chawla has the fastest fifty of the match at 18 balls. Second best is Samson with 19,10
Who the fuck buys those shit coins,5
¬£70 quid for a fucking useless coin,4
"Calm down with Uthappa bashing, ya cunts",1
So is Smith to RR is what Warner to SRH?,3
2014 Uthappa was so good,6
That shade of dark blue was originally RR's color. But then MI started using the same color and it became associated with MI as MI became more and more successful. The pink on RR now is a nice and unique change.,7
"considering the ground size, what's a competitive score here? 200+?",2
Atleast this ground will see sixes being hit,1
Can we get rid of this idiot umpire fielder said it was six and he was still reviewing it with third umpire,2
Why is buttler not playing?,1
Piyush Chawla back on. Hoping for a few dots. Dont think even all his insulation can take any more damage.,2

It‚Äôs the best ball for RR,2
Shit knock,8
Is Gambhir running for MP in Kerela or something?,3
Blessing in disguise for RR. Trust me I'm a KKR fan,5
Unacdemy is paying around 15 mill for this Unacdemy six,3

Faf! yay boy!,2
Anyone else feel that Dhoni this year is starring in more ads than usual?,2
nice catch faf,3
Chawla gets a consolation of Grandpa wicket..,6
Why Rahane is not playing?,2
They put FaF on boundary and he delivered. He should'd been there for Smith.,4

Now Faf is in the correct position,2
FAF,1
Robbie is finished can't even clear Chawla here,2
"After Stoinis's rampage and now Sanju's madness, Warne is probably giving all the walls in his hotel a fresh coat",3
As expected:D,3
Told you. Uthappa going to make chawla look like rashid.,7
My god the commentators were so giving many excuses for Steyn's fuck up on the boundary last night,5
Uthappa bro...,6
Who the fuck are Hattons of London and why are they trying to sell me fake currency?,5
Uthappa classic 5 (9),6
Csk to pull this back and restrict them to 180,1
"I'm surprised to see that teams still pick Uthappa. There are lots of young domestic players having better form & ability than '2020 Uthappa'. I get it, he was proper T20 batsman in his prime. But you get my point, he's not good anymore.",10
This could be the last season of uthapa,10
uthappa trying to one up miller's 0(0) with his 5(8),9
Why would you catch Uthappa?,10
Uthappam looking quite thicc there lol.,12
Excellent batting by Uthappa. Didn't waste too many balls to get out.,7

Dhoni doesnt know how to manage field",0
Piyush to Uthappa during the break: PLEASEüò≠ WE WERE BUDS AT KKR,4
Why am I getting 2018 Yusuf Pathan vibes from Uthappa?,3
"Chad ""Headmaster"" Faf v Virgin ""School Boy"" Curran",6
Uthappa is so shit he doesn't even have a place in Rajasthan royals,4
2 lords competing. Uthappa won!,6
oh to be fafs towel hanging by his waist rolling on the field,8
"Had to make the most of Chawla, no worries!",5
Shame he couldn't play another match winning 9(20),10
Sanju died for this,12
Robin got cheated here he was expecting that 13 year old,6
 5(9) when team is going at 12 rpo is exactly what CSK needed,8
Uthappa stopped being good in 2015.,7
Uthappa knuckled down all the way to drinks and threw his wicket away before he could bat out the session,6
Curran drops a catch faf let me show you how it‚Äôs done,5
lo and behold when the spinner makes the batsmen reach for it he actually gets a wicket,3
CSK's only chance to win was keeo uthappa in crease. Gone now,9
It started raining here and with utthapa my Tata sky fucked off,1
"Hope Parag does well this season, was a great find last year.",3
Arre chuthappa,2
I highly doubt Piyush Chawla is only 32. North Indian players are notorious for age fraud,0
COLLAPSE.exe installed,5
"Uthappa is two years past his use by date, unbelievable they bought Robbie stocks",3
Uthappa does a favour for his ex mate chawla,2
Faf could have caught that....oh wait he did,4
I think csk would be better off if they dropped that honestly,2
Battle of the Grandpas.... clearly the more superior one has won,2
Uthappa wicket was required for RR. Now they can accelerate!,6
RR really need 200 here I feel. Especially with that start,6
"Plizz collapse.

Thanks,

Every CSK fan.",4
Imagine getting out to chawla,9
Drop his big ass!,1
Tewatia can hit boys,1
Completely derailed that excellent start by Samson.,5
oh man sushant singh ms dhoni ad. this hits different now. :(,8
Tewatia? Where is Pan Parag ?,8
Sanju Samson almost ended Chawla's IPL career. Onion Uthappa has saved it.,5
"Thankful to Jos' family for coming along so he didn't get to play tonight, or we would be looking at astronomical scores",8
Rahul tewatia is basically shami with hair,4
Uthappa taken the score up to 200 with that innings. Was 220 before,2
Uthappa helping out his exteam mate having bad day with dots then n his wicket now,2
lolwut. Tewatia at 6. Where are the batsmen for RR?,9
I seriously hope Parag isn't a one season wonder. Last year he constantly bailed us our from these situations.,6
Jadeja really has Smith's number. Unlucky today to not have his wicket - didn't review the lbw shout and Curran missed a straightforward catch.,10
Ouch! Uthappa looks beaten up in his profile pic.,1
[deleted],-10
RR may be in with a chance if they can scrape to 160-165,2

it‚Äôs gonna be 190,4
"Rr tryna to a dhoni

Tewatia to do a curran",4
when you are happy that uthappa will not be here to suck the momentum but then realize that rr tail has already started,3
BCCI should allow Uthappa to play other leagues. IPL isn't the place for him.,12
Just joining guys fuck,6
Being this fat is unacceptable from a professional athlete! It seriously affects his game and it is showing. Wonder why many players have been looking like this lately,0
"Why is Uthappa even playing, he overestimates himself and takes too many balls to get set. He completely shifts the momentum to the other side. I remember seeing his last ipl innings, was so pathetic that he gifted mumbai the win.",7
I just dont get why RR didn't get a middle order batsman in the auction instead of a new opener when they're stacked there already. Got rid of Gowtham who was a decent no 7 or 8 too. Until Stokes comes back they're so light down the order.,6
Get Smith and these guys won‚Äôt even post 170,3
Oh wow redbull is a sponsor for RR. They really are all over the place,6
Royals should have signed Rahane,6
Gambhir knows talent https://mobile.twitter.com/GautamGambhir/status/1308419282309701642,2

Chawla only gave 8 in his last 2 overs.,5
MAN IDK WHY BUT I'M HAPPY FOR CHAWLA!,2
Why has RR not taken Binny. Not world class or anything but a pretty handy player. Can give you a over and 20(10).,8
RR reaching a score where having Dhoni in your team hurts you. Its going to be so sweet tonight!,2
Props to chawla for coming back,1
Why not send out the bigger Curran?,8
"First 2 overs - 47/0

Last 2 overs - 8/1

That‚Äôs Rajma Chawla for you",6
I'll thank Uttapam for slowing it down,2

"Rajasthan's batting looks deadly

Butler, Smith, Samson and Stokes is a terrifying prospect for any team",2

That shot deserves a lot of credit,2
"Parag, Curran, Gopal, Archer yet to come, They have a long batting line up, just need to keep going. Don't lose momentum.",3

Always weird to me when there are such few fours and so many sixes. It tells me the ground/conditions aren‚Äôt all that great for good cricket,2
"Number 1 test batsman,  gentlemen!!!",2
In lord unadcunt we believe,7
Best shot of the day!,1
220+ ?,2
how did he guess ngidi was gonna bowl away from the offstump?,6
I thought Tewatia was a spinner.,2
"Rahul ""Fuck r/cricket"" Tewatia",10
One good thing that came out of this years ipl is no cheerleaders. Fuck that shit honestly,20
in the tamil commentary they almost called Tewatia as thevadiya which means whore lmao,44
"Me: Mom can we have Buttler?

Mom: We have buttler at home

Buttler at home:",22
can we just replay this game,6
Smith ffs no crazy stuff,6
Dhoni looks tired AF.,6
Still can't figure out wtf did DC leave tewatia such a good all-rounder,3
"Somebody said Uthappa will score 15(19), He did him one better with 5(9)",25
"\*Butler and Stokes will be unavailable\*

RR: Oh no! Anyways.",27
Tewatia summoning his inner risabh pant,3
idk they're making it look too easy. maybe this pitch is a complete road?,7
Chawla went for runs. Terrified for JU,5
Total 6 distance 1036 m ? What kind of dumb stat is that lmaoo,89
Does the women from Whitehat Jr ad look like Alexis Fawx to anyone,4
"KP always seems so jealous to see batsmen playing these shots. 

I sometimes think if he was playing today, with a supportive board and coaches willing to encourage an experimental style - he‚Äôd be the greatest white ball player of all time.",18
Worlds best batsmen everybody.,4
dude we need rayudu,3
Which team is RINKU at?,3
Adding up the total distance of sixes might be the single dumbest stat I've ever seen.,68
We want TC,3
RR has Jofra‚Äôs 4 overs. No way CSK is winning if RR makes 200+ which they should. Also CSK missing Rayudu.,8
Lord Unadkat,0
"""Every child in the world will now learn coding"" sounds like a threat.",99
When I was shadowbatting like Smith with a book my friend asked me if I needed to take a shit,10
Total six distance is the most useless stat I have seen,16
Yes Cricket is already not complicated enough so lets add up six distances for no reason.,8
"Does anyone know how to force Hotstar into split screen mode?

Or even pip?",3
"Lol KP trying to fit in with the other old coots in the commentary box

""The game's changed""

Stfu you played bbl until a couple years ago",14
Each ball that Tewatia wastes is the ball that Curran would have launched for six,5
What happened to Ambati tho,2
Total Distance : What a usefule metric,2
get smith out and they'll choke at 190,2
"Ffs get us 200, is that too much to ask?",3
"Average six distance is 79m this innings. This has been elite hitting, not just luck with short boundaries.",6
Only hope for CSK is that Unadkat gives away a century in his 4 overs.,6
Steve Smith style is sooo good,2
"I'm good with Kohli, Dhoni doing ads. But wtf is up with Ganguly?",7
CSK need a good powerplay if they have any remote chance of chasing this down. They always bat really slowly in the powerplay.,2
I would pay to listen to Mark Nicolas if that was an option,3
"Lol Sanjay Bangar explaining Smith's batting

Why arent i blind n deaf",5
Why teams gonna face Russell in this ground,8
Tv9 is infamous in Karnataka.,4
Parag should've come in,2
"Smudge playing a gem here, This is what was needed yesterday from Bairstow.",1
Makes it happen,2
Curran's comeback!!,1
"Fun fact: 15 years from now a young boy from India will code the Skynet program. Get ready for the Apocalypse, courtesy of Whitehat Jr.",7
I want to see Curran bowl to Curran,7
Sammyüòçüòçüòç,1
Ngidi is like a junk digital watch that keeps showing the wrong time and then when you smack it a couple of times it unexpectedly shows the right time,1
Great yorker Sammy,1
MakesThingsHappen,3
TC vs SC looking very likely,7
Gone,2
Thevidiya out,4
Looking at Sam you can never tell he can bowl such beautiful Yorkers.. highly underrated.,3
That looked plumb af.,2
"What rhymes with tewatia

Chut... hmmmmm",1
Dunno looked plumb,5
Why did Smith allow that review lmao,4
r they reviewing that wtf,8
Who the fuck is Tewatia wasting a review,7
Imagine Tewatia using up the review lol,8
Run collapse.exe,4
Why is Buttler not playing in the IPL for RR?,2
Smith definitely didn't want to tell him to review that,5
"if they dont cross 200 after samson's heroics, this will be a letdown.",6
EA Cricket 2007 vibes from Mark Nicholas!,2
YEEEEESSSSS SCURRAN THE SURREY LAD,7
Do we have Sam Curran bowling to tom Curran now?!,12
Tewatia channeling his inner Watson lmao,6
Rule of thumb. Never refer to Smith for DRS,17
Toe crusher,4
smith didn't want to review that.,8
Wow a KM of sixes! Amazing innit KP,3
is it missing leg,1
"Poll for which curran bro is better comes up

Sam gets a wicket

Thats more like it",5
Who the fuck reviews that?,11
"Don't worry CSK fans... Remember that time raina scored almost 90 runs in powerplay...


He did once he can do it again",6
Dumbest review eva,7
WELL BOWLED THAT SAMMY BOY,3
People saying RR have 4 overs of Jofra as if Unadkat won't just balance that out,13
What a waste of review,6
How deluded do you have to be to be reviewing that. Absolute chutyagiri from RR. You ain't winning this.,5
Steven Smith be like: Nai Nai tu lele Review bc,9
Tewatia ka kaat diya,0
Twat fits,3
2nd worst review in the last two months.,5
plumdog millionaire,6
Is this supposed to be CSK home ground?,1
That is defo hitting,2
Its called the ‚ÄúWatson effect on reviews‚Äù.,3
[removed],3
BY THE BAREST OF MARGINS,2
SAM V TOM :D,0
Need a Curran vs Curran matchup here.,1
The third umpire sounds so lovingly earnest.,2
Bye Thevidiya thanks for using the review fam,1
what a useless spoilt cunt,0
Bring in Tom Curran now. We want Curran vs Curran.,1
Paine tier review,2
"Please don't deny us the epic battle 

CURRAN VS CURRAN",2
trash review.,1
Told you Curran delivers.,1
Lol why did he review that,1
Tewatia you twat,3
Ma mans just reviewed an LBW off a yorker,5
"Ah yes, the Watson school of reviews open early",3
Robbed of a Curran v Curran battle,1
Chawla‚Äôs 2-0-47-0 is the second worst first 12 balls of all time in T20 cricket,3
Imagine tewatia using up a review,1
"Tewatia walks off the ground next to Shane Watson, who has just sprinted to give him a guard of honour after seeing a replay of that review",7
Atleast reach 200 please,1
Still a better review than someone middling the ball with the bat,2
I have no idea who any of these players are,1
"Smudge has got to be more ruthless and just say no to reviewing that, come on he knew that was gone",5
"Sam v Tom, I cannot actually wait",1
"Even if this is an amazing batting pitch - CSK's batting isn't that great to be as good as RR have been. Our best batsman from the last match isn't playing today, Vijay looks clueless, Watson needs more time to get going, I have no idea how good Ruturaj is and no idea how good the middle and lower order is either.",1
tewatia? More like chewtia,1
"Umpire giving him that ""hum toh chutiya hai bhenchod"" look.",7
**TWATIA**,6
"**16.2** Curran to Tewatia, OUT, that is out. Tewatia has been swiping across the line too often here. Given out lbw but he has reviewed it. He has missed a plum full toss, and is hit on the toe. The only question is, if it is angling down. it isn't. He has burnt the review **167-5**

R Tewatia lbw b Curran 10 (8b 1x4 0x6) SR: 125.00",2
Ffs I thought it would be Tom next,3
"Here comes our prince riyan parag, the next big thing",2
Gonna need a Watson special tonight,2
They forgot to take mean of the total six distance. I mean wtf are we supposed to gain from that. Average six distance might be something to look forward to.,3
"rr missing butler very, very badly rn.",3
"I don't think I could keep a straight face when 3rd umpire says ""you are on screen now signal out""",4
"If Smith says *I don't know man, looked out to me* then you fucking listen.",8
They rock and roll plumb stuff like this but won‚Äôt review short runs lol,6
Dafaq hahahah,1
"Anything short of 200 , RR can forget the match ..

Tiny boundaries and dew to come in later",4
Everyone calls Tewatia a hitter I've never seen him hit anythinggg,8
Watching Indian players in Sharjah is nostalgic for 90s cricket fans. There used to be a time when India played in Sharjah every year. Sometime twice a year.,5
Sam is so cute lol,10
Why is SCurran slowly turning in to a tiny Stuart Broad,10
Smith gonna be given out on an absolute howler on 99 now,3
"RR:  No Butler, No Stokes

Smith:  Hold my Sandpaper",7
"Sam ""Death Bowler"" Curran",2
That was a Sehwag kind of review.,4
Now I can see why smith allowed sandpaper.,2
For the first time ever Piyush Chawla looks older,1
"Oooooh what a goal, i swear I've never seen anything like it",1
Wanting to see Curran bowling to Curran,4
"As someone who played school cricket with Riyan, I really want him to do well.",11
Atleast cross 220 fffs,3
Much needed boundary,1
All I want is a Smith 100,3
"After total distance metric, I personally would like them to add ML models predicting next six distance",4
Royals need to be careful. They need to slow down for a couple of overs or they won't reach the 20 th over,1
"This whole Whitehat thing is cringey af. Why would you want your 1st grade kid to learn code? Fuck that, maths is enough. Coding isn't rocket science that you can't learn later. Scammers.",12
Mark Nicholas's voice is so soothing.,3
Pan Parag is good. I remember last year he won the match against us. And he's gone.,2
Only time you'll see big hitting from Tewatia is when he's bowling.,3
"Parag already doing better than Uthappa. Brain dead from RR to send Uthappa ahead of him.

Edit: Lmao and just as I say that he's out. Still better than Uthappa though.",2
"Have hindi commentators called Sam Curran ""Chhota packet bada dhamaka"" yet. Seems like something they'd say.",8
Calm down fake crowd,3
"lol fist pumping after edging a four is a beta move, instant karma there",13
Keep your head high sam,3
the big choke.,1
Mark Nicholas really feels out of place in an IPL comm box,6
Sam Curran to shithouse his way to MVP,12
Lmao RIGHT AFTER  Riyan Parag was so happy for hitting a boundary lmaoooo,6
We'll see Curran v Curran bois,7
"Sam Curran is having a good IPL so far.

Nice to see.",11
"I often find myself wondering if Sam Curran will look young forever, or if he will do what Root did and grow a small beard in order to try and make himself look older",5
My man archers gonna steady the ship,2
Pan boi got pumped up a bit too early,-1
Woah calm down Curran,1
Lol celebrating his 4 and then gone next ball,5
I lou Curran.,7
Beauty from sam,2
Curran v Curran incoming,10
[deleted],7
"Get to 190, FFS. That should be enough.",3
Parag probably needed to go back to study for his board exams.,7
Mahi is still the best Indian wicket keeper lmao,3
Sam v tom let's gooo,7
I don‚Äôt know why people would expect anything more from pan masala.,6
RR could have had 220+ easily,2
Is there a stream without the fake noise? My head feels heavy watching this,3
sam curran is an absolute gem,5
"YEEEEEEEESSSS SAM V TOM, SAM V TOM",8
Didn't that pop out of his hand,1
"woahhh, fair play riyan bro",3
"omg just give smith the strike, you chu parag",1
It would be fun watching Tom punching Sam when Sam gets him out and sledges him,8
"**16.6** Curran to Parag, OUT,  **173-6**

R Parag c &dagger;Dhoni b Curran 6 (4b 1x4 0x6) SR: 150.00",1
Isnt Parag the guy with the cringe dance celebration?,5
Lol at Sam Curran. He came in front of Parag and then did the fist pump just so he could see.,7
Sanju died for this...,10
Shit RR wickets are going down in heaps. Smith needs to bat till 20th to reach 200,3
Sam v Tom now oooooo what a competition,3
I hate RR management!! Is this the best squad you could come up with? Can't forgive them for  letting go off Gowtham,5
Fuck Parag I drink only Amul,2
Sam Curran has one of those perpetually crying baby face.,4
"RR imploding spectacularly since Samson got out, on such a batting wicket too.",2
KLPD for Parag after that 4,3
Shabash launde,3
a lot pressure on smudge now,1
RR should have scored 240.,2
This CSK team with suresh Raina would be incredible,2
Now for potentially the main event. Sam vs Tom Curran,10
Damn! Samson made the rest of RR squad look like a bunch of gully cricketers!,9
This is going to be underwhelming if RR don't get to 200+,4
Honestly why would you not send Curran or Archer for the pacers anyway.,2
"Honestly credits to this comeback, I easily saw a 230 total to be chased",3
SCurran has definitely been picking up tips from Broad on how to be an annoying shit head on the field.,7
Shreyas Gopal can bat right?,2
OK now. SAM V TOM,4
I hope Miller's diamond doesn't come and haunt us,1
No Sam vs Tom?,2
If Tom gets out before Sam can bowl at him I'm going to be super mad.,2
we might see Curran brothers battle after all,2
Parag deserved to get out for celebrating after a fckin boundary...,6
"C H O K E
H H
O    O
K       K
E          E",2
Imagine getting Ben Curran on those big screens instead of those cringe DREAM11 fans,3
I hope Tom is chosen one,2
what's even the point of a 2020 ipl game without a batting collapse?,5
"So it's Curran Vs Curran. Will Curran be able to outsmart Curran, or will Curran play Curran like a fiddle, just as r/cricket predicted? Curran Curran Curran",20
"Sam Curran sooo effing good, reminds me of dougie bollinger was that one season",5
How tall is Sam Curran?,1
Timithy has arrived,1
"Had samson not been out

It wud have been 274 by now",3
Don't think they'll reach even 200 now,1
the stage is set for Smith,2
The pitch is soo slow that the ball is not even getting carried to wk,2
"**Most Runs in an IPL Innings with only one four**

Chris Gayle 104*(63) [KXIP V SRH, 2018]

Andre Russell 88(36) [KKR V CSK, 2018]

Meanwhile Parag celebrating 150 strike rate in dressing room,7
What is happening to our youth's hair? Chahar is going bald?,3
sam curran has amazing hair. considering all the humidity and all.,6
On my knees for Sam Curran getting 6 balls at Tom Curran,14
Bruh,1
Pitch slowing down,4
Has Mark Nicholas mentioned that Kevin Curran was an extremely competitive cricketer yet?,6
It will be criminal if they don't reach 200,3
Can't believe we're gonna have a Curran vs Curran battle soon...beautiful,2
Smith is going to blueball r/cricket by hogging strike for the entire 19th over,4
Dhoni legit looking like regular tamil guy now,3
Why aren't buttler and stokes playing?,0
It‚Äôs like Karan Arjun again and we know how that ended. Cheat to win!,1
I want to see Tom Curran belt Sam Curran for 6s. Battle of the brothers.,5
"Two brothers, pitted against each other. Really reflects the Curran state of affairs.",97
"Lmao, wtf is that backlift Tom Curran?",3
This team doesn't even have buttler and Stokes yet. Scary.,3
Ah an innings of 2 halfs,3
Nice Smith,1
We've reached a stage where commentators call any delivery not as fast as the bowler's average ball a knuckleball.,1
NOOOO,2
The side wicket looks more beautiful than the main wicket,2
Weirdly Tom Curran does look like Sam Curran's elder brother,1
The noise is overpowering the commentators. Feels like I have a fucking migraine,1
"Oopsie, no Tom vs Sam today?",1
Just stay in for this over,1
Playing out chahar is a bad idea. Ngidi and Curran won't give many opportunities to score in last 2 overs.,1
Curran vs Curran setting up like Curran Johar movie curran-tful climax,5
F. Y'all jinxed Tom v Sam,5
No Sam Vs Tom Shit,4
No Curran brother show,4
Well that was underwhelming.,1
"Ah fucks sake Chahar

And Tom. It's not really Chahar's fault

Actually fucking umpire",1
"Fuck you guysss

We jinxed",1
Literally everyone is mad,2
C H O K E,1
Is this a home or an away game for CSK?,1
"‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your fantasy?‚Äù

Sam Curran castling Tom Curran probably. I‚Äôm just watching",2
"Eurgh no Curran vs Curran.

I'm  furious!",3
Nooooo,3
"Alpha move from Smith to open after coming back from concussion, especially over Samson.",3
Booo I wanted Curran vs Curran,7
No no no,3
NO fucking reviews because of TWATIA,5
I have been cucked massively,8
"So typical RR collapse ..
SRH batters feeling good",1
WTF!,2
Well yeah Indian umpiring sucks. Should have used your reviews better lol.,1
Bet they wish they didn‚Äôt review the plumbers LBW,3
shambolic batting from rr,1

Umpire fail,1
Lol ipl umpiring.,2
Wtf chahar.... All r/cricket wanted curran vs curran,4
"What a collapse from RR

Tewatia lodu,2
"Such shit umpiring, unbelievable",7
r/cricket in SHABBLES,3

Trying to get unofficial review? Lol,6
It bounced,1
"Please let him stay umpires 

We want Sam vs Tom",9
"Terrible, terrible umpiring.",3
Not a catch?,1
Quality umpiring,1
Diabolical.,2
Bruh that didn't even carry. Surely the third umpire can call that?,5
Shit umpiring continues,1
Well done Tewatia you useless man,3
Third umpire intervene.,4
lmao it bounced too,6
Lol that didn't carry,6
"Didn't hit the bat/hand, didn't carry! Still out lol.",7
that was piss shit umpiring,5
IPL umpiring,8
Fuck it didn't even carry and it hit the pad,3
FUCK SAKE I JUST WANTED TO SEE MALFOY V MALFOY,8

LMAO how did side umpire miss that it bounced,3
Wtf is happening here,2
"LMAO, CHUWATIYAAAAAAA",2
I'd say again Indian umpires are the absolutely worst,6
There is a hope.,2
Tewatia denied us of Curran v Curran,3
Do 90% ipl umpires are retarded,3
"Come on MS, show some class.",5
Disgraceful umpriring,3
Smith should not ask the dressing room. Not that again lol.,2
That hit the pad and bounced before the keeper,3
Were csk bowlers were good all along and Sanju was better? Or is the rest of lineup bad? I'm confused,2
Surely the third umpire has to intervene.,5
Fuckin ipl umpiring,4
This is all down to Tewatia's useless review.,2
"Ffs, I‚Äôm in favour getting rid of umpires or restricting them to only a few decisions.",2
No battle of the currans,2
This is why you don't waste your reviews on an in-swinging Yorker hitting middle stump.,5
Umpires so shit. I think they themselves need reviews,5
"Hope they have enough grounds in UAE, I don't want the pitches to get overused and then finals to be 120 run affair",1
I think they appealed for the LBW...,1
It didn't even carry,2
FFs the spirit of Ulhas Gandhe still haunting IPL,1

Can you imagine how much of a fucking chad move it is to just refuse to walk off when given out?,6
Blind motherfuckers.,3
Fuck these umps I wanted Curran v Curran,3
csk inadvertently showing their cheater dna. classic.,-1
Umpires are trash,1
never enough reviews in the ipl,1
LOL. It didn't hit the bat. It didn't carry. Yet he was given out.,2
Normally I understand umpires sometimes make mistake but that was just a horrible call,3
"IPL umpiring strikes again

Fucken blind cunts.",2
Umpires suffering from Blindness and Deafness,1
Dhoni lambasting Indian umpires as always!,9

Dhoni shouldn't be complaining here.,8
DRAMA,2
Dhoni the cry baby !!!,-1
Wtf is going on?,1
Getting bowled out after that start is so RR,2
What. Is. Going. On,3
Interesting strategy from Smith not hitting sixes every ball. Lets see how that pans out.,5
CSK v RR 2019 flashbacks.,3
Dhenier pissed about free review,13
And it clearly bounced.,5
Peak IPL umpiring,11
How do these umpires have a job?,7
Shouldn't Dhoni know it bounced too?,12
RR vs CSK n dhoni umpire fights... ipl is back boiiiis,10
Did it even hit the bat?,3
Let him stay im for the cultre,3
Dhoni Cheater ‡≤†_‡≤†,2
Stuart Broad is proud of this effort from Tom,12
cheater thala,1
The fact he claimed that catch üëÄüò≥,7
Lol. Shite umpiring.,4
but tbh especially in the ipl u have to use the review only for howlers,1
After all that he didn‚Äôt even fuckin catch it,4
Csk vs re and dhoni arguing with umpire do I seen this befote,2
How do they get extra review????,3
Is Dhoni taking our side ?,1
So if you don't have any reviews left you can just hang around and the umpire will refer to third umpire instead?,10
YES the Curran bowl is here,1
Clearly bounced,5
Premier League and Indian Premier League competing for worst decisions.,7
Why is Dhoni even complaining lol,3
"Didn‚Äôt hit it, didn‚Äôt catch it, not a great decision really.",5
Dude dhoni is being shaddy af.,6
ABSOLUT CATASTROPHE,3
"After the umpires said its out, can they change their decision?",7

Stay classy MS lol,4
Dhoni cheating,-4
I am siding with RR here because I want Sam VS Tom,6
Plot twist : ball touched the ground,5
Shame Shame,5
So they‚Äôre checking for the fair catch even though they know he didn‚Äôt hit it. Cricket can be weird sometimes,12
Can they not talk over the third umpire?,7
Cheater Dhoni claiming a bounced catch,15
Wtf is happening,3
Two negatives makes a positive,7
Fairplay award my ass.,6
You don't need review to check catches,6
I thought it was lbw lol,5
Cuz fuck the spirit of cricket,8
Lmao umpiring standards are so shitty,15
"In case you're surprised by the standard of umpiring. Please don't. 

This is standard Shamshuddin. You should be more surprised anytime he gets one right.",10
Dhoni so ethical he drs reviews for the opposing batsman,21
how did the review happen,8
Dhoni the scamster !!!,1
Thala dhoni can't do wrong.,3
"umpire was like ""huh what?  sorry I wasn't watching yeah I guess thats probably out""",18
Just remove these umpires and make 3rd umpire decide everything.,8
Dhoni wouldn't know it bounced. Umpires should have asked the third umpire for help immediately.,6
Top bants,3
Thanks 3rd umpire,2
[removed],8
Dhoni is not amused it seems,3
Good that it was overturned because that would have been a shocker.,7
What a shambles. I love T20 meme leagues,6
YEEES,2
"Sorry I missed it, how did RR get another review?",4
It's impossible that Dhoni didn't know that it bounced. Really poor from such a stalwart of the game.,0
SAM V TOM IS ON. GET HYPE.,12
CHITTING PENSIONERS,7
Out,0
[deleted],2
Why the hell is dhoni claiming the catch?,6
Dhoni should ve shown some sportsmanship ffs,1
Elite shithousary,4
Thala cheating shame shame,2
"If there's no edge, shouldn't they check for LBW as well?",2
Lmao if he gets out next ball,2
Dhoni behaving like egoistic here had it had been kohli socaol media would have been on fire,3
MS Cheati,1
Even Dhoni wants a Curran duel,2
Ah yes ah yes Sam vs Tom,2
Horrible decision from the umpire. Rightly rectified.,2
Flirting with danger with this but Dhoni surely knows that it bounced. It wasn't that close,4
Only 4 off that over,1
Curran vs Curran back on bois,4
What the hell was all that?,1
Fucking 4 run over,2
"not cool to claim that, dhoni bhai. just not cool.",5
Why does the catch matter if it didn‚Äôt hit the bat in the first place,11
This is setting bad precedent. Had Tom walked away like a good player they probably would not have reviewed it. I am happy that technically correct decision was made but it needs to be more graceful.,5
Imagine something happening like this in MI matchü§£ü§£ü§£,2
[deleted],6
YOOO SAM VS TOM,4
No Fair Play award for Csk this year,8
Mofkrs,1
Umpiring is utter joke.,4
Where do they pick these umpires from?,2
Lol what a joke.. why jump the gun and say he was out if there was any doubt,2
Ok we‚Äôre officially getting Curran vs Curran noe,12
Brother fight time.,3
AW YEAH MALFOY V MALFOY STILL ON,6
Deepak Chaher has that smart Alec look about him. Annoying IMO.,1
"If the umpire can self review their decision after giving a decision like this, then why didn't they do the same in the KXIP match?",4
This is stupid. The umpire made its decision and they didn't had any review left. Wtf,-1
The standards of umpiring is worse than gully cricket. What's going on?,2
Two mistakes cancel out eachother. This is how it works guys.,6
"Tom Curran dismissal overturning is a clear case of ' Sir adjust karona,  out nahi tha'",2
"So  

- Out without nicking  
- Out without catch   
- DRS without DRS    

Whew",12
"Dhoni claiming that catch, cheater",3
Took the long way round but got there in the end,1
classic dhoni,3
They umpire like they're 50 yo government employees,1
now for the real plot twist when it turns out it was out,2
Curranbowl is one.,1
Maybe one day the IPL will get umpires that aren't utter fuckwits,4
cApTaIn cOoL,6
I think Dhoni can definitely complain here. The umpires could've gone to the 3rd umpire straightaway giving out a s a soft signal. Going for 3rd umpire's review after such a long time doesn't look good on the umpires' part.,-1
Was that LBW or caught. Absolutely disgraceful if Dhoni applealed for the catch!,7
Ahhh IPL umpiring. I didn‚Äôt miss you,2
BCCI needs to get some international umpires asap !!!,2
Pakistani fielding has a new competitor.,0
Dhoni just did a pakistan there yo.,1
Fuck kirana store umpires,3
Did Dhoni claimed that as a catch? Cause he very well knew it wasn't. Damnnn,4
"177 in 18 overs after that start? Wow, quite the comeback by CSK",2
Curran vs Curran incoming,1
This is not correct... They shouldn't have given for third umpire once it's given out....,0
Is it an understatement if these fuckers don't reach 200+,2
"IPL wanted the Curran vs Curran draw, no other explanation",3
Shitpost here but hasn't MSD lost a lot of weight?!,5
Dhoni crying for Curran's wicket FFS,3
"MS wants to call him back hahahaha, these BCCI appointed commentators are a joke to ethics",9
"Wait, that's illegal",1
How do you shamelessly check for bounce but not for contact with bat?,1
The aggression MS shows these days towards umpires is kinda off putting. It makes me feel like he knows that he is untouchable due to his stature in Indian cricket.,10
This is next level idiotic umpiring,3
Bizarre,2
WHAT THE FUCK.,2
RR struggling to get even 200.. Samson must be fuming.,2
Dhoni probably forgot about the 1 gazillion cameras are covering this event. Subverted expectations,4
BIGGEST CROSSOVER EVER,2
"So given it was out on field, would be out LBW.",1
I actually thought he gave out for lbw,2
Wait so if they reviewed that would that have been or LBW?,1
"Inside part of Dhoni's gloves are made of Dhoni's gloves and outside part is covered by the entire fucking stadium, that's the secret why every delivery is a fucking wicket.",3
the great IPL war pitched brother vs brother,2
Absolute bullshit umpires in the ipl. Ganguly pls have a look at this,6
"I hope they drop Tewatia for the next game, so he can think hard about robbing the world of 

Curran Vs Curran",2
Lol Dhoni say bye bye to fairplay award,7
Imagine explaining this to an American. Either his or your head will explode.,3
What's with this weird camera angle when bowler is bowling?,3
Wow commentators upset after a fair decision,0
Right BCCI needs to invest in umpires.,7
madness,3
I reckon Sam gets the better of Tom. Just because they're playing in India and Sam can do no wrong when the word India comes up.,3
Curran vs Curran!!,6
Third umpire was still checking for ball bouncing though it didn‚Äôt hit the bat is peak umpiring,10
Proper village umpiring,7
Did the onfield umpire retract decision?,3
I have no idea what is going on the past few minutes.,5
IPL umpiring ‚Ñ¢,3
How would that lbw work wtf,5
Dhoni claimed that wtf,7
Ek toh chori upar se seenazori.,5
So that was literally an LBW...,4
Curran Vs Curran :),5
Ethical Chennai boi sad at Thala,7
"fucking bullshit umpiring rules need to change. 3rd umpire needs more authority to intervene with wrong decisions. the correct decision matters, not the process you go through to get it",6
Lbw lmao,2
Inb4 this was the only bro vs bro ball.,6
So if CSK took a review it would have been out,2
Elite shithousery,1
Ipl version of Curran Arjun,3
lol they were claiming a catch tho!! wtf an lbw now?,1
Is Doulle on acid?,1
Total shambles this is.,2
"finally , sam vs tom",4
Holy fuck did they review it for LBW,4
That was an IPL trademarked umpiring clusterfuck.,9
"What a farce! So if it was caught, it would have still been out because they were only checking for a clean catch on the review, even though he CLEARLY did not hit it...

Shit umpiring",17
"I remember Dhoni running Ian Bell out when he thought the ball had crossed boundary, just before lunch. Then he went to their dressing room and asked to reverse the decision. This was during that horror tour of 2011.

Dhoni for CSK would run to the ground to shout at the umpires, argue with them when a review has been taken. Passion is something else.",2
Please fire Nitin Menon after this.,-1
"Curran to Curran achieved lads. Shut down the tournament, we've peaked",7
Hahahahahahaha this is shambolic,3
I don't understand how we've seen an incredible improvement in the quality of Indian players thanks to working with overseas players/coaches yet the Indian umpires remain shitehouse despite working with umpires on the Elite Panel,9
"I‚Äôm curious to know what happens when batsmen don‚Äôt have any reviews left, but the umpire would like to go upstairs anyway because they‚Äôre not confident of their decision?",3
Curran v Curran. Bring it on!,3
LBW LMFAOOOOO,1
Kaption Kool,3
How can anyone take these matches seriously with this umpiring lol,12
Fucking Curran can't do anything wrong.,2
Even the 3rd umpire is retarded,7
Scurran is God,2
Sanju Samson punchin the air rn,1
Yayyy they aren't touching 200 today,2
Dhoni chacha is cheating. Where are these csk asshats now?,3
[deleted],6
This is wrong on so many levels,2
Lol that was out anyway.,2
COLLAPSE,2
Smith can't clear boundaries,2
Hahahaa what a farce it ended up being out LBW anyway,2
"How did Dhoni did not realize that ball bounced, anything to win for CSK",5
"So the ball didn‚Äôt connect, it bounced before catching, and Dhoni appealed + umpire gave out.",3
"That was lbw out on ump's call!!

Lol",2
"Setting a real shitty precident here.

Shit umpire. And on top of that free reviews.",0
Smith 69 nice,2
"Shit batting, shit umpiring",2
Even the third umpiring is retarded it seems,2
"Damn, it was LBW out. Unfair",2
You can't go to IPL but IPL can come to your gully,1
[deleted],-1
I don't care of there is a review or not. It's a wrong decision overturned is all.,2
Nice!,1
CURRAN FOR PURPLE CAP,2
I‚Äôm so fucking confused,2
Is this one of the most disgraceful Collapses,3
Malfoy using his daddy's influence to overturn the decision.,4
they still didn't get the decision right after all that?,1
God this wicket has slowed down,2
Why is Dhoni still not over it,1
rip 200 dreams,2
Wow great Ethics question. Umpire gave out for caught behind but he was out LBW. Where is Ethical Ashwin?,1
just want tom to hit few sixes so that there's some drama today too,3
No way Smith didn't get out at 69 on purpose.,4
"Smith is out.

But it's Curran vs Curran.",3
We wouldn't countenance such umpiring in street cricket.,1
"No matter the team I support, I‚Äôll always be happy to see Smith get out.",4
Bb- erm ipl umpiring,5
How is it umpire's call when the ball has literally gone over the stumps? I don't see how the deflection made the ball go over the stumps.,4
"Every time I see Robin Uthappa is playing I forget that he hasn't retired ages ago, I swear he has always been much older",3
It was LBW. What the fuck,1
They have messed it up big time,1
Would've probably been LBW plumb right? No edge at all and they didn't check for LBW?,0
Kohli is right about club level umpiring I guess,5
They will be 30 short,1
Is the IPL umpire panel sponsored by some kind of blindess charity or something ?,3
"Smith out for 69, nice",1
"Proper implosion from RR

200 seems like a stretch now",1
Dhoni vs umpires in an RR game part 2.,4
dheneer having some small talk with umpires so we don't end up at the bottom of the Fairplay table,2
Remember in the big meme league when James Pattinson was given out run out by the 3rd umpire despite having half his bat in the crease. Who was the opposing captain that let him stay on?,5
Smith out at 69...Nice,5
"STRONG SURREY, STRONG IPL",5
Shambolic Performance everywhere from all departments,2
"I feel cuz of Samson getting tempted they lost 30-40runs. If only he waited, he could have gotten more runs out of Chawla and some of the other bowlers.",2
YEEES SAM CURRAN WIIIIIICKET,1
Oh boy! Smith is really a weird person.,1
Please don't talk about that ball again. Don't go down that rabbit hole. Last thing IPL needs is another umpiring controversy.,0
Sam curran setting up smudge wicket by dropping his catch,3
Less than 200 and I back CSK,1
Was it hitting the stumps,1
I can't hate Sam he's too good,3
So RR got a free review? Because the umpire had already given it out,3
"**18.2** Curran to Smith, OUT, S Curran has another wicket. Smith has looked out of gas for a wee while now. He looks to whip a length ball to leg but gets no power behind the shot. Caught at deep midwicket. CSK back into this if there is dew later tonight **178-7**

SPD Smith c Jadhav b Curran 69 (47b 4x4 4x6) SR: 146.80",3
Indian umpires are stealing a career,10
"Jesus y'all are retarded. Dhoni wouldn't be able to tell if it had bounced. It's not like his gloves are super sensitive. Also, the ball barely bounced before it, so it would be impossibly to tell if he had gotten his gloves underneath it or not",7
These fuckers don‚Äôt know what they are doing. Umpires look absolutely clueless which gives a really bad outlook to the whole game.,7
What should have been 210 at minimum will end <200,2
For the people saying Dhoni should‚Äôve shown sportsmanship i personally think the appeal from csk was for lbw not caught behind it was t he umpire who just assumed otherwise,5
"Pretty shitty umpiring overall.

Smith wasn't given out earlier and then this.",4
From 60 Meters to MCG - The story of our collapse,4
The umpiring has been so shit and it's only been 4 matches.,3
Curran to Curran now,3
Smudge gone for 69. Nice.,3
This is an England intersquad game now,7
Its gonna look like a major victory to restrict RR to under 190. Only CSK are gonna be at least 20 runs short,5
"Sam vs Tom and Jof, you love to see it",7
BCCI: hopetheywilloverlookthis hopetheywilloverlookthis,2
I think i am in love with sam Curran,7
lol projected score was 234 at one point. masterclass collapse from rr.,4
What a beautiful sight this is,3
TOM CURRAN WINS YAYAY,3
"69, noice",3
Hot take: RR already have enough.,4
Haha we actually thought RR would cross 240 at a point,3
"The thing that warms my heart the most, other than Steve Smith batting, is Steve Smith shaking his head trudging off the field after posting a significant score",5
So the umpire can only check the carry not the edge or lbw. As the umpire says Curran hit it there is no way that can be changed,5
SCURRAN TO ARCHER,2
Sam vs Tom finally,3
that's some collapse rcb would've been proud.,3
CSK is the most boring to watch but they get the things done.,4
"Remember there was an article posted a while back about Dhoni valuing the Fair play award very highly. 

Ain't happening MSD",8
"lmao after 11 127-1

in 7 overs they only scored 50 :|",2
commentators doing dhoni dhoni is cringe,5
Yes Curran,2
"Dhoni will be also remember for someone who was so passionate for Chennai that he did some really embarrassing thing in that yellow jersey. Mind you, he's the same guy kept Kohli's aggression in check for india. Such a shame üòû",1
That was lbw?,2
This is 3rd edged four on Curran bowling lol,2
Tommy v Sammy,2
Tom 1-0 Sam,3
Finally the moment that we had all been waiting for!,4
Wow Watson took like 14 minutes to get up after that dive lmao,5
Aah Bro fight is here..,7
Curran 1 Curran 0,8
Dhoni getting angry at CSK vs RR. Check,10
They will be so disappointed by not getting to 200.,2
Dhoni fan boys stop downvoting every comment which says Dhoni cheated !!,1
"Sam gets the moral victory, Tom gets the runs",6
"T: 4

S: 0",3
Why does IPL have dogshit umpiring?,4
No one here knows what Dhoni said to the umpire but many trolls seem to know exactly what he did say. Unsurprisingly most seem to be RCB flairs lol,6
LMAO perfect 4 for a sibling argument,3
"Sam Curran, the short medium pace bowler, being the leading wicket taker in the the IPL is very 2020.",2
Shreyas gopal can hit no?,1
How is Sammy this good in T20's wtf?,3
Lmao,1
HOLY FUCKING JADDU,3
Fuckin jaddu rockets,2
Nice throw,1
Question: can you still get sanctioned by the match referee if you call your own brother a shitcunt when he gets a lucky boundary?,2
House Slytherin in action,2
"I've never seen Jof doing anything with the bat, but am  constantly told by comms that he's ""no mug with the bat"". Let's see him do something useful then",6
"I'd be pissed if my brother hit me for a 4. Like help me out, bro",5
"The fact that sycophancy is now rewarded world over, not only in commentary is making the world a really grim place for me.",2

What a throw,2
SIBLING SHITHOUSERY. INJECT IT INTO MY VEINS.,7
Jaddu's got such a gun arm,9
Didn‚Äôt realise I was watching an inter-squad England ODI,10
"Umpire given it out. They didn't have review so if they checked for catch, they should've checked LBW too, to be fair for the both team.",7
Massive collapse here,4
Holy Shit!! Jadeja arm is too OP!!,3
Whatta throw,2
Damn I doubt if Jadeja is human,6
LOL HIT FOR A BOUNDARY OFF YOUR BROTHER LOL,4
Jaddu <3,2

"Look at the highlights of IPL matches when you want to learn how to get all your batsmen out in 10 overs

Come on Jof!,3
I wonder if Curran family dinners are awkward when there's the *other* Curran about.,6
Almost had two diamond ducks surely that‚Äôs never happened before,2
No,1
What a throw though.,2
RR may not make even 200. Monumental collapse,2
All poms at the moment,3
"I thought Dhoni was going to call him back, would do anything for Csk's win",3
"Sam is better than bravo now, come at me.",4
Fight against brothers with Archery involved. I think I have seen this before!,5

"Sam Curran attacking the stumps vs his brother and Tom trying to smash him,no sympathy whatsoever. Very good rivalry",9
LMFAO CURRAN POLL,7
From playing together inbackyard cricket to Ipl these brothers have come along way,4
Always looked safe to me that üëÄ,6
Jadeja is superhuman,6
Still confused as to why Dhoni spoke to the umpire,8
Anything over 180 will be difficult for CSK given how they always take their time in the powerplays.,4
Two diamond ducks in an innings?,7
Curran-Archer is more like Karan-Arjun,9
"Tom is the brawn, Sam is the beauty, who's the brains?",5
Punjab robbed :(,2
"Fucking BULLET throws from Jaddu man,,,",9
Sam is rocking that headband,8
Sam Curran is one of my favorite non Indian cricketers. So pumped to have him on CSK,11
129 after 11 overs. 57 in the last 8 overs.,10
"All the controversy for that short run made this happen. They probably thought that breaking protocol is worth it, rather then having a situation like that.",9
"There's actually no concrete evidence AGAINST the fact that MS Dhoni is the reincarnation of stoic philosopher-king Marcus aureliuS (MS).  


I will further research into this direction as I await my commentary contract from IPL for being on brand.",34
That was the most perfect throw from boundary,5
"Sammy is dominating in polls against Tommy.

79-21",6
"All teams collapsing after a good start, dafuq is happening?",10
"Had the ball carried I'd assume the 3rd umpire would have given that out (under their protocol where a catch and not a nick has been reviewed by the on field umpire).

Would have been a total shit show*",8

What the fuck man. If they can reverse decision like this. They could have given that 1 run to punjab,2
Unfortunately no Scurran did not bowl out TCurran,6
Knock them up jofra,2
Dugout explaining why Dhoni thinks it was out - y'all should listed to the experts.,3
It actually bounced off of thala's sweat and entered the gloves therefore it had to be out for sure.,7

First good thing Jof has done with the bat for ages,3

Go on Jof lad,3

ARCHER YOU BEAUTY,1
Just a reminder: This is similar to what happened in Gill incident vs Delhi. He was wrongly given out and umpire overturned his decision which made Delhi players complain. The only difference being square umpire gave it not out instead of third umpire.,2

Four Sixes in a row bloody hell,2

"I don't see anything wrong with behavior of MSD. 

Appealing for catch is his job. He most likely have not felt that it touched the ground.

And he had every reason to complain, because umpire had already given their decision. And RR had no reviews. And still they stopped the batsman from going out.",8

This over is never ending,4
"Fouurrrrr.

Want dhoni to give a nice kanpatti ke niche to ngidi,2
10 off 3 needed here.,2
129 in 11 overs. 57 in next 8. 27 in next 3 balls.,4
Chawla & Ngidi need some BCCI paid therapy sessions after this match,17
man i like ngidi don't want him to be meme,12
put some ice on,2
Ngidi hit 50 runs too,2
England players are too OP.,3
Archer has scored more than he'll probably concede today!,13
Wtf is happening?,2
"Jesus fuck, someone picked a fight on twitter I see",5
r/ngidi in shambles,7
"Just when I thought CSK couldn't get it worse than Chawla, Ngidi is cooked.",8
Lol 27 off 2 deliveries,14

F I X I ... sigh,6
Ngidi bowling the over that won't get over,7
[removed],3
I can't stop laughing,6
Kill me already,4
Somebody needs to bowl a mini-over,0
Record for most runs in over???,3
I pity ngidi now,4
For God's sake someone call the police. Nigdi's career is being murdered here,13
"""20 run over incoming"" 27 off 2 balls. 
That is what I said just before the over started",9
"10 minutes ago: ""So much for 200""",17
All the momentum for csk gone,2
I've never seen Archer hit so many sixes in all of his matches put together,7
"Jofrarcher smacking 19 off 3! Who'd have thunk it. I was just about to say before this over that CSKA Moscow have done well to pull it back given that they looked headed for well over 200 when Sanju 'Samsonite' Samson and Smith were together, but this shambolic final over has spoiled things for the bowling side",10
Ngidi wants to beat kxips last over.,1
lungi would've gotten dropped from any other team but dhoni will persist.,6
No way no way Ngidi you cannot do that,8
this is exactly how I dream of hitting sixes and finish the innings,12
Lungi dance lungi dance,10
3 BALLS 27 RUNS.,8
Tells you how hard it is to hit 6 sixes. Man I want to see that happen in future,3
Almost 20 overs 4 fifties ngidi samson chawla smith,2
BAT DEEP,11
43 is the record?,2
Haha yuvi record still safe,6
Come on let's make this over 40 runs,1
Kill meeee,2
"Archer is a part of the BATDEEP^TM team in international cricket, so of course he can hit them",18
LMAO,3
Lungi jealous of Umesh Yadav,7
"This IPL is insane 

10 of 1 &

27 of 2",11
Who said CSK matches are not interesting? Lmao,9
Piyush Chawla must be like thank fuck it's not me.,16
"Slow balls on the offside, archer cant hit that",1
Jeeeeezzz,3
Who gave 37 runs in an over in IPL?,7
Ngidi is match fixing lmaoo,-8
How are we watching Stick Cricket in Live TV?,11
We really missed Jos in this match,9
Ngidi isn't going to bring up BLM again after what Archer did to him.,16
Watson will hit a century and win it boys.,7
"Brilliant captaincy by Dhoni this. Bowl no ball after no ball so Jof tires himself out crunching six after six, that way he won't be able to bowl as fast in a few minutes time. Simply next level thinking.",39
Lungi did a reverse Chawala in the last over.,19
Black on black crime happening rn,21
100m should've sent it straight into the car park,13
"Jofra ""Mascarenhas"" Archer.",16
"No six sixes 

But it was still amazing",10
"
apology for poor english

where were u when csk dies? 

i was sat at home eating curd rice when srini mama ring

‚Äòcsk is kill‚Äô

‚Äòno‚Äô",35
Baby cut over.,5
Archer seeing his trolls in the ball.,21
Can't wait for all the fixing accusations....,10
Hit it out,4
"*taps head*

Is this RCB in yellow?",12
"> Kochi Tuskers

Fuck I forgot they were a thing",14
"Chawla: I feel sad :( 

Good guy Lungi: Its ok bro, hold my Castle Lager",20
"Jofra ""Mascarenhas"" Archer.",22
Only Srini mama could come up with this,6
I‚Äôve never seen this shit betore,8
Now having flashbacks when Jofra played a game against the Gloucestershire 2nd XI to prove his fitness for the Ashes test at Lords; took 8fer or something then scored a ton. Ah.,17
Hey is that Mohd. Siraj,4
Lungi making Umesh Yadav look like Glenn McGrath,14
Ed Smith gonna bump jof up the order ahead of root,16
This gives me Ben rohrer vibes,1
blue balls...  bleh,2
Csk vs Rr = dhoni getting angry because of a umpire lapse,2
Chawla feeling Happy in the corner...someone more shit than him,8
Tom curren weak vs the chad archer.,9
Ngidi is a good bloke though. So this is sad.,19
"No one would have anticipated this kinda performance by Jofra Archer. 
Happy to see smiling RR faces.",4
IPL spent all the money before they thought about paying the umpires. What else can be the reason for such dogshit umpiring?,5
"You have to take Ngidi out, and bring Tahir in",5
[deleted],23
Winning percentage of CSK winning this match is exactly 0.0000001%,1
Csk has activated rcb mode,5
The score card would have been the same had MI capitalized on their great start.,-1
Sammy is the only bowler who saved his face here.,2
"as an mi fan i gotta say, 'mogambo khush hua!'",6
36?,2
People having Archer as their captain/ vice captain have already orgasmed,14
Ngidi... please get a bigger shirt,1
NGIDI is dragging himself from the pitch back to the start of his run up to bowl another one,3
CSK is the new meme team,3
CSK's over rate has been shambolic thanks to so many 6s. Gonna be a long long night!,3
[deleted],9
I just can't seem to take my eyes off Ngidi's nipples,6
Ngidi more shit than Chawla lmao,3
Ngidi with those nips playing 3D chess with Jofs mind,5
Well Ngidi ain't Rabada,5
I wish this was a 8 sixer over,16
Ngidi nips üò≥,7
Chawla would be low key relieved,6
"Nigidi got proper gyno, get him drug tested",2
What is all this moustache and beard stuff?! I thought Lungisani and Kagiso were the cute babyface brothers of south African cricket!,3
2 more runs for most expensive IPL over,2
Its Watson vs rajasthan now,4
Meanwhile dhoni tips thrown out of the park just like the ball which archer hit,1
Ngidi dropped next match,1
"the English tail and wreaking havoc on a team in yellow, name a more iconic duo",19
"4 days into the IPL and we have already seen a 30 , 28 and another 30 run overs!!",14
This match has had some serious half centuries in a while,7
1 10 4 2 1 1 1,2
How old is Sam Curran? He looks way younger than Rashid khan,4
Archer being a prime Dre Russ,4
And just like that Chawla was 2nd worst bowler.,12
those moobs on ngidi,7
That on par. I think.,-5
Ngidi is cooked! It's energy sapping out there!,4
217 it is!!! Let's gooo CSK,1
Cmon jof one more,3
A little anticlimactic ending after that lol,5
Have they tried putting ngidi in rice overnight,11
So all that is needed to stop the run flow is to bowl into the wicket,3
Ndidi the new member of Dinda academy,10
50 plus wet t shirt winner Lungi. Great tits.,14
Cricket is such a cruel game. Ngidi gonna end up with worse figures than chawla who bowled fuck all and was saved by his former team mate.,13
England found new test opener lol,10
Just a causal 30 run over to end.,10
216 wtf,6
This IPL has had more drama in 4 matches already than IPL 2019 lol,12
Imagine conceding more than Chawla. Hilarious.,5
30 runs.,2
Went with Archer instead of Ngidi in my fantasy team. Boy am I glad I did that!,15
Lungi took admission in dinda academy,3
"Lungi Ngidi conceded 27 runs in 2 balls, with power hitting by Jofra Archer. This is record I guess.",10
[deleted],5
"Ngidi should never bowl in death again, ever. It should have been 190. How did they concede 215. Totally nullified the hard work they did between 13th-19th over",7
Ngidi's bad patch lasted a whole 4 balls. Shows how good a player he is.,10
I would like to formally offer Lungi an honorary degree from RCB bowling academy.,10
Now I know what english fans feel when Jofra hits sixes,23
"25 off 6 Jof?

Where‚Äôve you been hiding this for the last 2 years?",13
Smithy only got 69? Can't believe his hand eye co ordination is gone. RIP,9
Ngidi umesh,2
They had 27 runs of the first 3 legal balls of that over.,6
Cannot wait for a vijay 1 (10) innings while chasing 217.,29
Even Smith wouldn't have hit this much,5
Thank you Jofra and Ngidi,10
Look at how they massacred my boy!,14
C'mon we can win this,8

Just how? He has tweeted everything lmaoüò≠",17
"My God. These Chode Boundaries‚Ñ¢ remind me of when we were chasing 8 off the last ball at our school ground. Thankfully, that tape ball tournament, coach decided to settle for wide off and leg boundaries, but at the cost of the runup coming from the boundary line. Wicket keeper on the boundary line too. 

Away team had a quota to fulfill. Gave the last over to Mr. Gruntdeep who graduated from Dinda Academy of Class Bowling (Class 2016). 

**Them:** 169 allout (20)

**Us:** 161 - 9 (19.5) 

12 runs needed off the last ball. Me on the non-striker's end with a solid 2\*(1). My frenemy, hardcore aficionado for DC, could barely hold a bat properly if Deccan Chargers' sole title was on the line. 

We get through five balls, scraping by 4 off these 5 deliveries. Man. This motherfucker Gruntdeep. Full on Sikh turban Harbhajan style, thick moustache, stray chin hairs. Storming into the pitch bowling these 60kph dibbly-dobblies outside off - all while letting out thes orgasmic grunt landing his foot at the crease. 

So. 8 needed off one. Praying Gruntdeep gifts DC-twig a wide where we can risk taking a single. Thinking I'm gonna pull a Brathwaite last ball. 

And then he starts running in - man's speeding in like he missed 10:55 AM Rawalpindi Express train. Now I start to digress from my Brathwaite heroics and think about what he may be thinking as he draws closer to the crease. 

*""Hum to Gruntdeep hai. Hum toh wicket karenge.""*  

That seems about rig‚Äî

*""AHUUU-HUFFFF-AAAAAH""*

Before I can finish my thought process, Gruntdeep storms into the pitch, letting out the sound five goats BLAAAA'ing on ketamine would make - with a little bit of distortion toward the end, of course. Because I kid you not, every fuck thing slowed down the second Gruntu let the ball out his left hand. 

DC-twigglylegs stammers for a second before taking a *massive* swing of the bat. Jesus. You best believe he got nowhere near that soaring 120 scorcher. But he wasn't the only one. Neither did the wicketkeeper. Nor the boundary. 

ll... a six. Didn't matter where it fucking came. But Gruntdeep, you *bloody* legend. Bottled it like a Tim Southee downing a Smirnoff after bowling a super over. Jesus. 

We couldn't have won it without you and your heroics. Granted, we got our cheeks clapped in the playoffs, the ten of us managing to put together a half-century that was chased in six overs. 

But I don't give three shits. Because this post is kindly brought to you by Chode Boundaries‚Ñ¢.",4
Jofra is such a scam ffs. Now I think he can actually bat despite him averaging -3 for England over the past year,31

Csk today: RCB bowling",9
Samson nonchalantly murdering the bowlers and then saying the pitch wasn't good reminds me of Malan and Morgan in a T20 a while ago commenting that Buttler's innings at the top was so good that they misread the pitch and went too hard to early because he made the pitch seem a lot better than it actually was,17

"Nice to see Twatto‚Ñ¢ and Vijay getting set for their second innings after this. 

Smart strategy says score around 110-115 and leave about 100 or so for the next 20 overs.",3

People shit posting on Unadkat but I believe he is going to have a decent enough IPL this time. Lad is going through a good phase. Won the Ranji trophy while captaining his team.,2
The umpire looks so done with everything,1
Excellent running between the wickets,2
The last time LORD Undacunt played under Smith's captaincy...he took 24 wickets,3

Time for Vijay to go checkout watto wife,10
Unadkat always looks like he just gave away 30 runs in his last over,14
"Imagine an opening partnership of Gayle and Watson. A quick single for them would be a grounded shot that pierces the infield and rolls all the way to the boundary, is saved by a desperate dive from the fielder, and then relay throwed back to the far end",9

I was told there would be no balls and free hits,11

"As IPL viewership reaches 200 million records here's few critical notes cum rant on Star Sports broadcast:



They do a great job in giving IPL a colorful and quality video quality. But they need to calm down on Thala and Super V dick sucking. 90 min of pre show is full of cringey praises of dhoni. Even greats like Sunny G & K.P has to do it too much. 



If we had won 2019 WC you could say well Aus broadcast used to do this in Ponting era too. But that team lived up to their hype never felt uncomfortable listening. "" Gee Punter is a hooker"" "" Gee Haydos Coming and murdering the Vas again"". 


Need to be more like Eng Broadcast. Everyone knows Naseer is in one sided love with Stokes. But he waites till Stokes does something special to lose his voice. Just this. Also Neroli Meadows might be thinking "" Indian people thinks only Dhoni & Kohli knows how to play Cricket üòÇüò≠"".

"Oof not sure what was worse - 

That shot selection

Or that *celebration*",13
FUCK OFF SHANE,6
Lmao What kind of weird ass celebration is that?,8
"Curran so sweaty already, shouldn't the players be allowed to play shirtless in this heat?",4
Huge wicket that.,8
"Tewatia, more like Twatia",2
We get sad Watto for 14 overs,10
No way that should have hit the stumps!!,1
"Oh Watto! Like to watch you bat, but love to see you go!",4
Oh yeah! HALLA BOL ‚ô•Ô∏è,4
Watson back off to the dugout to neck some pints of custard. Cya,3
Oh man we need to hit Tewatia off the park now,1
I predict CSK going over 200 but not finishing it off,20
Even tewatia is pissed off with fake crowd sounds,12
Twatia Bhujia Kha gaye Watson,4
"Rahul ""fuck r/cricket "" tewatia",11
Beauty from Tewatia. Game set match right there.,9
Can't blame him the fake crowd noise is really annoying,7
Tewati *thadiyan* gets one!,0
"Rahul ""Fuck r/cricket"" Tewatia",19
Rahul tewatia celebration style shows expression of many people of these community (annoying fake noise),14
"Was half way through typing that Steve Smith is my hero, Shane Watson is my lover and he gets bowled smfh",11
Never expected Varun Dhawan's friend from Humpty Sharma ki Dulhania to take a wicket,4
Watson's feasting was cut off. I have an eerie feeling that Watson gonna demolish teams in this IPL,2
Vijay needs to get motoring. Faf needs a few balls obviously .,3
"This wicket is a direct consequence of Vijay not taking any risk at the other end and batting at run a ball, with the RRR being just under 12.",4
Du plesis in. Where‚Äôs the new lad,2
Fafdu you sexy beast,2
At these times you need oppostions home crowd to troll them and feel the silence.,3
FAF,2
That wicket is on vijay. Putting to much pressure on watson.,3
Well at least they can run between the wickets now.,2
Tewatia celebration.... There's no one there mate,7
Lol. Tewatiya is a typical Haryana/Delhi/West UP guy,8
That stayed so low,2
Does anyone know if you can/how to disable notifications for the official IPL app?,0
SEND IN CHAWLA NOW!!,1
Tom is more happy than tewatia,4
and here i thought it's gonna be one of \*those\* innings from watto,6
Bet CSK won't even try to chase this now and just play for nrr,2
Twatiya gets Twatto,2
Vijay move on ffs,1
Why is Du Plessis wearing anything other than towel?,5
[deleted],4
Rahul Tewatia doesn‚Äôt seem like a guy I would wanna chill with,7
"I've seen that tewatia celebration before, probably from football. Can anyone remind me?",2
"Funny how the size of IPL official match highlights would indicate BCCI thinks we, the public have something better to do with our times lol. fucking noobs. Get the fuck on youtube like a regular person and post extended highlights you, damn cowards!",7
Tweatia has such a cute action,2
"Nobody:

Tewatia: Silences an imaginary crowd",11
"Murli ""I still think it's a test match"" Vijay",7
These two should consolidate‚Ñ¢ for the next 7 overs,8
No 3D Rayudu today?,1
Vijay eating balls. ffs,1
Lovely Vijay you got yoself a seat to Australia test tour!,3
i miss albie morkel.,2
"Tewatia letting everyone know,

Dilli se hoon BC!",3
god vijay is utter shit at this t20 format,2
Has jack bird gone unsold?,2
Probably the game that. Nobody else is a 200+ strike rate. Unless MS plays the innings of his life...,3
Damn Balaji is such a good looking dude,7
"Murali Vijay is on fire .

Never seen him score run a ball!!",7
"FAF and VJ are kindda similar, one of them is going to throw their wicket away trying to accelerate. Guess who?",1
I fuckin hate it when the IPL app redirects u to the browser for fantasy league.,5
[deleted],2
Vijay baadu mudila na poda,1
about time for Lord Devereux to bowl some filthy long hops,3
For a second i thought why they are showing Attack on Titan ad,1
6 per over for next 10 overs.,1
Feels like Chennai is gonna lose by 10-20 runs,2
Fap do pussy,1
Vijay needs to be on strike for Gopal!,1
Any body know how we access settings on disney+ hotstar?,1
I seriously cant tell if tewatiya is  off spinner or leg spinner,3
"Ohh Faf you almost got Vijay out, should have done it",3
All set for Dhenier to take it deep and then give up trying to win,3
"Vijay isn't the kind of player who can make up playing so many dots ball in the ens. He is gonna hit two sixes and then get out with a strike rate of like 120. I know it

Edit- nvm. I clearly overestimated him. smh",9
How could a Team chase a 217 when every batsman in your Team require few balls to settle,8
M Vijay playing till end of day one. Proper Test match cricket,6
"Quantum of loss Bois, let's do this.",5
I get a feeling that msd's role this year looks similar to that of Darren Sammy,7
welp!,2
Thank god. he's out,3
Chu vijay,1
"FUCKING RIDICULOUS, VIJAY JUST FUCK OFF ALREADY",5
Yessssssss VIJAY IS OUT!!!! THANK YOU,4
I just want to see MS bat in this stadium. Cmon promote urself big D.,1
"Fuck CSK

(I want to gauge the support here)",0
What an innings,2
Match losing knock from Vijay,1
Should've dropped that catch smh,1
Vijay going to date with Perry,4
Nice,3
"Smudge mah boi, finish off Unadcunt now",3
Why Vijay why? Why'd do that?,4
Massive 100 SR for Vijay,6
Cheers murali,3
Fuck off Vijay,5
[removed],5
Blunder by RR they got Vijay out. Huge mistake.,13
Superb innings by Vijay comes to an end.. send Sam Curran plz for some entertainment now..,4
How the fuck is this cunt able to steal better cricketers wives,8
That might actually help CSK,8
Dhollapse incoming?,6
Murali vijay shud bat out the inning n play for a draw,2
Time for dhoni to come now and show he's still got it.,2
Can we start with one down every match instead of playing vijay?,1
What's equivalent to a Dentury in T20?,2
Collapse,2
Probably Vijay's last action on the field for this season.,2
Why do all RR players have such gay celebrations,-3
Miller wanted a hi fi. Fuk you Shreyas,5
I'm not even upset. RR doing us a favour.,5
Vijay is cooked. Hasn't looked confident in both games.,7
"A run a ball blazing innings coming to an end for Vijay. If he can do this in tests, imagine what he will do it in .... oh no",5
Have faith in the Sam Curran century guys,7
Hope that‚Äôs the end of Vijay in the IPL,3
Vijay and Vijay Shankar made for each other,4
He should have atleast cleared the boundary,0
3D chess from M Vijay.  Tactical,1
Not a night to remember for MILLER,3
CSK needed Rayudu today!,3
"Leggies on top. Bring on Smith too, I reckon",7
"One of the worst innings. Chasing 200.
I know Csk likes to give chances but common he is a washed up player. Need to be booted out",7
"Not sure why Dhoni is holding himself back. Come in early, get used to conditions and then go big?",3
[deleted],0
SAM CURRAN UP THE ORDER,16
"I CSK fan, thank Shreyas Gopal for that wicket taking ball.",3
I think vijay has beaten Uthappa for man of the match.,7
"21 (21), did his job for RR in helping them defend this total",5
nice to see young indian spinners get the wickets considering what happened to csk's spinner.,4
Why is Vijay?,2
"**7.3** Gopal to Vijay, OUT, a sleepy little knock from Vijay comes to an end. He has hit in the air for a second time without the conviction of hitting a six. He looks to pull this slightly short ball, but goes only as far as deep square leg **58-2**

M Vijay c Curran b Gopal 21 (21b 3x4 0x6) SR: 100.00",2
Alright innings from Vijay. At least he doesn't look clueless now. Stick with him and he'll do much better in the later stages of the tournament methinks.,1
Why Vijay ?,1
Costly wicket this for RR. Vijay could‚Äôve easily given them a few more dots,5
Gaikwad 67(32) incoming.,1
"Well, I guess Uthappa isn't the only useless washed up batsman playing this game",2
Poor S Curran expected to Chase this down . Dhoni should be in first. Cowardly move,5
"Lol what did CSK fans expect from Vijay, He won't turn into Russell just in one day.",7
Sam Curran at 4?,4
YES SAMMY BOY LETS GO,2
Oh man I am feeling sad for Miller he is trying to fit in,1
Thanks for the math lesson Sunny!,1
Vijay was told they had to chase 217 in an odi,3
What a shit innings from Vijay,4
I smell Dhoni doing the last year knock against rcb but actually winning this time,2
Had a few beers and just wanted to let all CSK fans know - you all smell of arse and are disappointments to your mothers,-7
Is Curran really batting at 4 now?,5
Vijay looks like sad Shia LaBeouf,3
Curran in? Where is Gaikwad,7
Vijay compensating for uthappa,7
"If faf only wore a towel, the opposition would abandon the match just out of awe",6
Sammy lol,6
"After seeing Jofra hit 6666, Dhoni is expecting another English tail to have success",8
Sammy boi,3
Before we know it Sam Curran is gonna start opening,5
Curran my babbyyy,3
Sam Curran on it from first ball,5
Rayudu should play with 3D glasses,2
daddy Sammys backkü•µü•µ,8
Man the coms are horrible people.,5
Holy shit they actually promoted little Malfoy,5
Are we finally going to meet Kedar Jadhav's hamstring today? Its been too long,3
Vijay should have done this 10 balls ago. He let pressure build on Watto,5
Agent Vijay did well today,2
Yesss Curran my boy,3
[removed],4
"Sam "" can make things happens "" Curran. Get it Sam!",7
No way Vijay gets selected after this. Has he lost his skill completely?,2
Dhoni will make Sam a top order batter and he will bash India in the next Test tour,5
Fucking finally. Curran showing intent,2
good move,2
Sam Curran - Got a free license to hit hit git git.,1
Bowl TC now you nuggets.,3
M Vijay departs & CSK fans in the stadium make fake noise. Yaaaay !!,7
"Finally, my love is here",4
"Commentator: this will we a challenge for Curran.

Curran: is the bowler Indian?",10
CSK doesn‚Äôt even have a replacement opener for Vijay. I think if Gaikwad plays ok then Rayudu can open along with Watson.,4
Sam is single handedly carrying this team in all the departments except fielding,4
"Required rate already up above 2 a ball. I'm going to call the GG and go to bed, it's nearly 3am",10
"Yea fuck losing wickets, just SHOVE every ball into the stands",3
Curran don't give a fuck.,6
"Tewatia has the most galli cricket action, next only to Kedar",5
Sammy boy!! Get your fastest fifty.,7
OK now I want an Indian bowler to take this guys wicket,5
"If I was a sugar daddy, I would contact Sam Curran first.",20
Must be embarrassing for Tom when your little brother is a better batsman and bowler than you,12
Shreyas gopal and sanju Samson talking in tamil??,4
CSK preparing Sam for future hmmm,7
Is the pitch slowing down?,2
This has actually been a shit collection of deliveries from gopal,2
This seems too much for Sam curran,2
"Do people actually think Dhoni will be able to chase this down if sent out now. He‚Äôs well past his prime, not too far off from Vijay...",8
Absolutely love this sort of super tactical t20 cricket. Props to CSK for going for it!,2
"Stage is set for a special Dhoni 55*(41), after scoring 35(35) and doing fuck all against increasing run rate.",22
Tom I think Sam's way is the right one,4
With warney in charge as mentor we can expect some solid strategy from RR,3
I could watch the IPL just for Select Dugout.  Best live cricket broadcast right now.,5
All I want now is Curran cunting Curran around for a few overs,8
If Vijay got out for 0(1) we would have actually had a chance,7
Vijay contemplating about whose wife he‚Äôs gonna mess with next,7
This is hard to watch.,2
He's gonna be a bitch to face in the England series,2
The Currans are both members of the Peaky Blinders.,11
Bowl Tom Curran now,4
Why haven‚Äôt CSK got replacements for Raina abs Bhajji? Their squad looks thin right now.,1
"Smudge, it is time to bring Tom Curran into the attack.",3
"lol, these Tamil commentators are exactly like the gully players cheering their teammates after getting out. 


> 2, 2, 2, 2... NOOOOO 1, 1, 1 is good",4
dayum ritviz >>>> over any song,2
MI scored 135 off the last 10 to pull an impossible heist against KXIP last year. Most chased in the final 10 in an IPL game. Need something similar today.,5
show Sanju Samson's innings' highlights you cowards,3
Sam Curran exists to take the piss.,4
VIjay looks so evil there contemplating which WAG is the most bangable,6
Is Sam Curran the next Albie Morkel?,7
Cant hit Gopal. Cant hit Unadcunt. Cant hit fucking Rahul Tewatia. Why tf do I support these  Grandpas?,6
"I know Dinesh Karthik upgraded or whatever

But seriously, how the hell did Vijay think he'll get away with stealing Karthik's wife. This cunt",7
Just send Vijay back to India for ffs,3
someone explain why vijay is opening for csk?,2
Curran vs Curran. Bring it on!,6
Thanks to Vijay - you cant afford to send Rituraj Gaikwad now. Should have made him open,3
Vijay just flipped a billion people off,10
Need Dhoni on to speed things up.,3
Bruh CSK being zzzz right now,2
one Curran c&b Curran please,3
yeah spank me daddyü•µü•µ,2
Sam the Saviour,3
"Wait, does that mean these square boundaries were as small during Desert Storm '98?",0
well. well. well.....,4
What's the point of playing Kedar Jadhav if he's not even sent in such situations?,5
"Oh Badrinath, how we would love to have you as our number 4 just like in the good old days.",5
Sam is suddenly crazy strong,5
I think I'm in love,7
Played Sammy,3
I want to say I love Sam but I don't want to go on some FBI list,5
Sam Curran is honestly such a little boss.,8
RR missed the memo about not bowling Indian bowlers to Sam Curran,7
Fuck yeah Curran. What a shot,6
Big Prick Sam,6
"IPL in Sharjah

More like Hong Kong Sixes at the Kowloon cricket club!",5
Sam 'The license' Curran,6
what a BIG DICK six.!! Curran what a playaa!!,8
"Fuck it. I AM gay. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

for Sam Curran",8
Actually struggling to think of a single match winning M Vijay innings in the last few years.,2
Vijay should change his nickname to Old Monk.,0
"Hopefully we see the backyard battle in sharjah, Tom Curran v. Sam Curran.",3
Dhoni's experiment with Sam Curran working well so far in two games,1
Sam is the family favourite Curran,7
Curran has to play a Samson type innings for CSK to even have a remote chance of winning this,3
Murali‚Äôs UNBELIEVABLE response to r/cricket,4
We just need one 30-run over from Unadkat. And we should be good.,6
I think Sam Curran is a reincarnated version of a British guy who was forced to leave India in 1947.,31
50 tournament sixes already,8
Don‚Äôt üëèbowlüëèIndiansüëèAgainstüëèCurranüëè,18
Sam too OP pls nerf,3
Sam loves abusing Indians they are going to make him an honorary Pakistani and then he can't play in India ever again,9
Techutiya,3
Thank you tevatiya,1
Genuinely bring Tom Curran on now or we riot,9
 we got the better Curran,11
So vijay was shit nothing with bowling or setting eyes,2
What's the highest score chased in the last 10 overs in IPL?,3
"Faf and Sam, I'm here to simp",3
This is how Vijay ought to have played,3
Thanks Dhoni. Just showing England how to use SCurran for the world cup!,8
Ed Smith has seen enough. Archer and Sam Curran will open in tests from now on,10
Curran my man!!!!!,5
he's the fuckin GOAT man. Sam Bang Curran,4
Sam Curran just don't give a fuck.,8
"Dhoni's personal choice, had to be good.",3
AGEHANEHAIXBA,0
"KKR has Russell, we have Curran!",3
Best way of defense boiz and gurlz.,1
KXIP in shambles,1
CSK has to play an innings like CSK to win this,2
CSK got this,3
Stop it Sam.. Tewatia is already dead.,1
"_It's on the roof! It's bouncing around on the roof!_ - T. Greig, Sharjah, 1998",3
When Rayudu comes in. Drop Vijay for Gaekwad. Vijay is plain useless.,1
Sam Curran hitting better than KP ever did in the IPl. kP giving credit to the new kind of bat,3
Settle this with a Curran v Curran punch up if the match goes to a super over,4
now I can forgive Sam boi for dropping smith,3
Ugh why did we let Sam go,3
Omg this little shit again,5
"Very cool SCurran, very cool.",2
LET HIS BROTHER BOWL TO HIM,3
Disdaaaiiinnn,1
Can‚Äôt wait when RCB play a game in this stadium .,3
Samuel you beautiful bastard,1
THAT WAS GOOOOOD,1
Oh man :(,1
Yall . Sam is the daddy here.,1
This tournament is just the English boys world and everyone else is just living in it!,1
"Okay, why the fuck did kxip release better Curran?",3
"If this match goes close or to the last over, I'll definitely believe matches are manipulated to make them more exciting. Any professional team should be able to close out this game now. Its more than 2 runs a ball.",1
Yeah twatia take THAT,3
Bring your best bowler in now . Unadkat.,3
Faf is a brilliant partner for Curran.,5
"Feels good to cheer on the Curran lads, right?",12
RR made a big mistake by taking Vijay's wicket.,8
Lol,2
Irony is only Sam curran who is not a permanent of csk looked capable to chase down this total,6
"Tell you what.. This is eeeeasily gettable given the size of the ground. Knowing what's coming next in the lineup, my money is on CSK.",4
Samson my man,4
Goneee. Expecting too much from little malfoy there,5
I swear even England won't send curran so Early,10
Nice,2
Sam no :(,4
One shot too many Sammy boy,3
twas good while it lasted,9
Oof,4
"Rahul ""Fuck r/cricket"" Tewatia",15
Oh shit noo‚òπÔ∏è,6
Lol,4
Night watchman gone,7
That was a stupid play,6
Fuck off Curran,0
"No Sam v Tom

:(",4
Send in Jadhav now,1
Ok. It‚Äôs over.,4
"Shame to see him go, but he did his job there",10
With how aggressive he was playing a wicket was imminent,9
Dang dudes,1
At least he doesn't waste balls.,9
Twatted again!,1
Na sam. You scored in the over. Be smart mt dude.,4
"Sam ""cameo"" Curran",7
Nice nice niiiiiiiice,4
Lol.....tewatia is quite interesting to watch.,3
Tewatia 2 r/cricket 0,13
In before Faf's 100 of 30 deliveries,3
Simon doull was just talking about game changer in favor of Sam.. And he's gone after a sec... Lol,5
"And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the game done and dusted",5
Seeing the back of Curran is so pleasing even though I'm a neutral. Guy triggers my England test series PTSD whenever I see him,19
Too big for your boots Sammy,4
Thala when?,2
"SamC couldn't replicate what SamS did. 

Still a better batting story than VJ.",8
This is where CSK needed Raina. I really feel bad for Raina not able to participate in this tournament.,16
Good bowling tbh from Tewatia. Had courage to give the ball some air and voila.,13
Damn tewatia is playing well today,7
Sam scared of facing Tom in the next over. Committed Sepukku,12
[removed],10
Big oof Samdum!,4
Do we have only Indian umpires across the board for the IPL?,3
[removed],10
How long will Dhoni hide himself in the batting line up?,14
Jadeja probably in,2
Reverse jinx successful. Daddying Sam worked!,7
"In a 160 chase, 17(6) is useful.

Not when you are chasing 217 

A wicket just switches the momentum",13
"**8.5** Tewatia to Curran, OUT,  **77-3**

SM Curran st &dagger;Samson b Tewatia 17 (6b 1x4 2x6) SR: 283.33",2
"Damn I had no idea there was another Curran, Ben Curran!",9
Vijay used up over 1/6 of the innings to score less than 1/10 of the runs,14
Old Sammy is so entertaining,7
Dream dismissal for a spinner getting hit for a couple sixes and then this.,6
Csk in the soup now.,3
Congrats rr,1
all this is good from the long term point of view.. keep playing him in this role and we soon have a pinch hitter who can bat anywhere... well done sammy! on to the next one...,17
Made my disheeshun,4
"There is an Indian women's cricketer who also wears floppy hat i think, looks exactly like Jaiswal",5
Game changer,1
When Sam hits puberty he‚Äôll get tall enough to reach the crease from that position,19
I hope csk does something with Vijay. I don't want to see this cunt in a goddamn cricket fucking field ever again. I can't man!,7
This tewatia is a pissoff,8
Man I'd rather 17(6) than 20(19) in this situation,7
We are missing Raina,4
This doesn't affect my love for Sam whatsoever,9
Dhoni will take it deep now,3
Curran was sent just to undo the damage done by Vijay. Why did they sent Vijay in the first place lmao,10
Tewatia cunt and his obnoxius celebrations.,4
"It‚Äôs always a complete gamble on who dhoni sends, only team where it is this hard to predict",5
Smart bowling from Tewatia. ~~Wonder if CSK made a mistake in not opening with Rayudu and Watson instead of Vijay?~~,2
Is that Badrinath in the dugout?,6
Sam has potential if he learns to play the long innings instead of swinging everything...,5
"Strategic time out, or for the CSK players, time to take their meds! /s",11
Sam is like Rishabh in batting but exceeds as a player cause of bowling,2
"Waiting for dre Russ to play here, should be fireworks",3
"WE ARE SCREWED, PRESS F IN THE CHAT BOYS",11
CSK NRR is gone.,11
I want tewatia vs kohli right now.,6
"If Thala doesn't come in now, just nussing to say!",6
Damn tewatiya...Why you gotta be so cruel to us,6
Good thing is Curran will learn about patience in the CSK camp so you can expect him to play longer innings than those quick cameos.,6
Ahhhh.....missed Curranbowl part 2,3
[deleted],4
I don't think I've seen any CSK batsman go after almost every ball in the first ten overs in a really long time. Kinda refreshing to see tbh even though he got out,11
"My TV stopped working so I couldn‚Äôt watch the second innings so far, how‚Äôs it going for us",3
Nothing but respect for Sam Curran. Curran (a bowler) sent to undo the damage Vijay did,1
He did his jobüëçüëçüëçüëç,0

CSK were too slow in the PP for a 217 chase. Poor strategy.,4
"Look man, I wanna see Dhoni bat. Pls don‚Äôt said Gaikwad.",1
"Few quick wickets fall

Perfect time for dhoni to come in and consolidate",1
[removed],6
CSK isn't made up for this type of game we already know.,8
Curran failed today but I hope he does well later. He has the potential to be a great bat as well. He‚Äôs better than Tom.,8
Sam Curran is like that dude you call to bat in your gully cricket team cause he's so good but the opposition will only allow him to play for an over cause he's too good.,5
Now I'm just waiting for the inevitable Dhoni-Jadhav partnership to start so that I can sleep peacefully,7
Gavaskar‚Äôs commentary puts me to sleep faster than my ambien pills,6
"Hope Jadhav comes out now , really want to see him do something .",1
"Lol stop hating on Tewatia's celebrations you guys, this stuff is what makes watching sports enjoyable",14
one of these days Currans gonna finish off a game by himself. He's got it in him,2
Should have sent Curran in PP.,5
Cant wait Umpire ananthapadmanbhandhan to be in elite panel someday,5
I am waiting for folks to justify this as saying Dhoni wants the youngsters to learn lol.,6
We need WC Jaddu please,2
"Finally Bradman is here!

Edit: Bradman scored a duck in his final innings.",3
Sam Curran is the only dude that hits from ball 1 in CSK. I appreciate the lad,9
Ruturaj is in. Such a good name.,3
Umpire telling Tewatia to not be an asshole,13
I think the match was done before the chase began. This would be a tough chase even for teams with multiple big hitters.,6
samson is a gun wicketkeeper too man. koach needs to give the lad a solid chance.,5
"Jadhav, Dhoni and Jadeja still come... You'd be crazy to write them off.",2
"Jadhav, MSD and Vijay - 3 consolidators can not be in one T20 team.",3
"Guess they are throwing the kid into the 216"" deep end of the pool.",7
What even,2
What the fuck,3
"This is the perfect time for dhoni to walk in. Knowing dhoni, he won't.",10
That was ugly. Ugly af,6
"Rahul ""Fuck r/cricket"" Tewatia on a hat-trick",12
Iits gai vs baiil,1
LMAO,2
Nice,2
And that failed,5
*facepalm*,5
What the hell,5
Wow.. what a ridiculous play.. absolutely retarded,6
Lmao. Much ado about nothing,2
Hit the F bois. Done for the day,6
MS Phoney too scared to come in early. Shambles,4
Oh no,3
Hahaha,3
Wtf was that. Lol. CSK gonna lose by 50+ runs.,6
quack quack,3
Smh wtf,4
That's a terrible shot,4
Lmao what the fuck was that even,6
Even Faf's laughing lmao.,24
Dhoni should have come now,3
OK stop with that celebration TWAT.,10
That is some brain dead batting!,11
"**Sam Curran is consistent in two games**

18(6) & 17(6) with bat.

1/28(4) & 3/33(4) with ball.",10
never imagined that i would see an ana de armas ad during an ipl match,2
there are no spectators what is this dude celebrating at,3
Twatted thrice!,2
"Ala ala, gela gela",3
What the fuck was that,3
Lol shitshow,2
I don't think the Ceat Tyres Strategic Time Out helped all that much.,7
Faf smiling that he will get to play with Dhoni,3
Wtf was that,3
That's literally no replacement for Vijay now. Can we somehow get Raina to comeback,2
dey!,3
"fuck this!!

we're fucked",6
Lmao,2
Aayagayawad,1
Far laughing his ass off at Tewatia's celebrations aka discount Imran Tahir.,9
What an incredibly stupid shot to play on your first ball.,1
Epic bruh moment,1
Wtf celebration is that,1
Why man why,1
That was stupid.,1
Revenge of the Dhenier?,2
ugly play get him off the team,0
Doesn't it qualify as conflict of interest for a BCCI president to promote a betting app .,4
[deleted],3
"Sachin's son: Who is that cute boy in CSK?  
  
Sachin: Curran Arjun",13
bhai yeh game thoda zyaada hi accha chal raha hai,3
Bruh whyyyyy,2
KEKwad,3
Third wicket for Tewatia.,3
Mofo thinks he's depay,3
Dhoni has to come now.,6
Dumbest shot ever. Lol,9
Tewatia 3 r/cricket 0,10
"Aight, time for bed.",1
Tewatia can smd,7
"**8.6** Tewatia to Gaikwad, OUT,  **77-4**

RD Gaikwad st &dagger;Samson b Tewatia 0 (1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00",3
This is what he was told to do.,6
Lololol. Should have stayed in quarantine Gaikwad,1
Tewatia watched too many depay highlights on YouTube,7
Even faf is having a laugh. Poor lad,4
"Sunny is acting as if CSK is batting first. I‚Äôm guessing Dhoni himself told Gaikwad to swing hard, just like he told Curran.",6
Mai *** hu jo isme aya,2
Even I last longer in bed,5
We'll most likely see Ngidi bat before Dhoni,4
Really feel bad for the young lad.,4
"go easy on the guy

he's just been out of covid",3
CSK will want to forget this match as quickly as possible.,5
You can‚Äôt hide forever Dhoni,4
Quick question to long term IPL people - are CSK basically the Chelsea of the IPL fanbase wise ?,3
Dhoni really be playing as a number 11 and sending number 11 to bat before him,7
Yeah what's the point of that extravagant celebration,6
Rahul Tewatia's wicket celebration is exactly what my friends do when i try to discuss anything else than among us.,7
Tewatia is better than Warne even before training with him . Lmao you chahal Fan Bois Scared? Be very scared üòÇüò≠,2
let‚Äôs just save the nrr we lost this,2
That was village from Ruturaj.,2
Faf's reaction is the same as mine lmao,9
CSK is missing Raina and Harbhajan big time.,3
Even dhoni is scared of tewatia,3
Why was fap laughing lol,2
Dhoni is a specialist captain and wicket-keeper?,7
Does this bot have an RCB flair??,3
Poor Gaekwad. Recovered from Covid just tonsee himself do that,3
Royals NRR gonna go through the roof today.,3
Gutted for Ruturaj. panicked first ball,2
Csk losin a wicket whenever i come on here. Cya lads,1
Tewatia is that uber driver who never used GPS and keep asking where to come,11
Tewatia is being a chutiya,4
Perfect opportunity for dhoni to score 20(35).,5
Village level wicket,6
"Sunny G is too harsh, they are chasing 200+ ffs",1
Tewatia should not get any more wickets because his celebrations are total cringe.,8
"If there was a walking wicket ever , it was Ruturaj",2
"[I was right ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/ixm2v5/match_thread_4th_match_rajasthan_royals_v_chennai/g686enb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)


He just started from where don left off.",2
If Gaikwad's is the greatest batsman that is to come out of this year's IPL I weep for India's future batting stocks.,0
Dhoni knows he can't be the hero so he's not going to bother,7
Dhoni doesn't want to bat or what,4
Is rayadu not playing?,1
Well it‚Äôs still not Dhoni folks!,2
I don‚Äôt know why we still have Jadhav in the squad,2
"""This Sam Curran dude looks like he knows what he's doing, I'll just follow him exactly but in reverse""

-Ruturaj Gaikwad probably.",6
What a horrible decision by the batsmen there. Why would you do that on the first ball. FFS.,1
"Thalla coming at 110 for 5 at 15 overs.

Thalla fans: match was already lost. Thalla rocks

Future update: Thalla drops Gaikwad for making him bat before over 15.",11
"fuck these CSK batsmen are going to give Twatia a bigger head 

he's going to use up another review next time he bats, he wont even ask Smith",8
Need Thala to display an excellent test inning,3
What is with his celebration?,4
Not all debuts r golden I guess,3
Jadeja n chahar next,2
"hattrick of stumpings ? possible?
if its jad, my bets are on",3
"Holy shit, Jadhav is in the squad?",7
There are so many Jadhav fans in the fake crowd,8
Our NRR's gonna be soo fucked after this match,3
I was told Rutu was good.,4
I thought he was going back for a second lol,3
"Rahul Tewatia: Yeah r/cricket, talk nah",6
Still no Dhoni??,1
"Bruh there's is no one in the crowd to show off your ""can't hear"" to",5
What the fuck is Dhoni playing at,1
"Ruturaj was trying to socially distance himself from the keeper

Stay safe guys",11
"""Can't hear you"" celebration in an empty stadium is _________.",22
My man has just done a Fawed Ahmed and bought out 2 left gloves,4
Dhoni doesn't want to bat. Knows he'll be exposed for how past his prime he is,7
Dhoni doesn't bowl but bats 9 these days,9
CSK NRR after this match is going to be - 10,3
"Just come out and play a really boring game. People will complain, but we need to go to playoff. So fuck them.",4
Lmfao gaikwad,1
Tewatia calm down buddy.,3
Gaikwad looks like an anorexic Chandimal,2
"ee tewatia jeene haraam kiye hue hai.

  
T- Twetia twatia",6
Delhi let Tewatia go so he can‚Äôt fail.,9
Faux Dhoni walks out,11
"Why did the chicken cross the road?
Why doesn‚Äôt Dhoni comes out to bat?",9
Senior citizens will retire to bed early today. Thank you!,7
Which situation does Dhoni bat in?,12
How many balls untill Kedu pulls a hamstring and comes back to play the last overs ?,28
Did somebody from csk diss tewatia??,2
Let him celebrate.,2
"Good time for my Bois Jadhav, faf and dhoni to score a solid 50 runs in the next 10 overs",12
Now you see who was behind the WC SF decision... üôÑ,8
Piyush chawals got cunted in this ground,2
"Gen next performance so far:

Bishnoi, Padikkal: great success

Jaiswal, Gaikwad, Garg: fail",5
Wtf is wrong with Dhoni? This makes me believe it was his decision to come late in 2019 SF,30
Tbh these days even CSK does not fail to provide meme content lmao.,9
Dhoni scared as ever when required rate is greater than 10 per over!,10
"People want MS to come out. üòÇ





Required run rate is almost 13. Do you want it to go to 26?",20
Perfect reasoning there by SunnyG,3
Tewatia copied Coutinho celebration against Unitedü§£,1
Haha mumbai must be feeling bad losing to this team.,5
"*What was that about? What was that about?*
 
Seriously though. WTF was that",2
Without getting downvoted where the fuck is Dhoni? Meant to be one of the best at this if not the best ever and is the captain,6
Why does Jadhav look like a mini person,3
"Still no Dhoni c'mon you're chasing 217, stop experimenting..unless you've lost the hopes of winning.


Dhoni we need you.",11
Dhoni comes in to bat when the asking rate < 7 rpo and finishes it at 19.5,8
Dhoni avoiding to go to the middle more than my nephew avoids school,8
Sometimes I feel that decision of not sending Dhoni up the order might be of idiot Shastri but let's be honest dhoni himself doesn't like to play up the order. That was fucking WC semis if dhoni thought I need to bat up the order today he would have gone to Kohli and did a 2011 final. #JusticeForBewda,6
Covid apparently affects shot selection as well in cricketers,2
"Jadhav will never run two, all fielders should be on the boundary line.",1
RR has hit CSK like a tank.,1
Oh no they're now unironically going to consolidate for 5 overs. Huff and puff to 155 and brag about quantum of loss ‚Ñ¢,6
"What are the chances of other players getting covid because of gaikwad??   
None because he didn't even touch the ball.",9
Sunny G shut the fuck up.,3
Get off Gaikwad's back. I'd rather my batsmen at least try to chase 217 than just do a VJ.,5
Gavaskar is like imma end this young lad's whole carrer.,3
Aaaah Quantum of Loss my ole friend,2
"""Quantum of defeat"" chat incoming pretty soon.",7
Looks like young Gaikwad is going back into solitary confinement after that shot,1
"Time for a Stupid stat:

Samson did the same number of stumpings in that one over as Buttler has done in his entire FC career.",10
Why did rayadu get dropped after the amazing innings,3
First tested positive for covid and now stupidity. Poor Gaikwad.,3
What kind of wordplay is Ruturaj ? It should be Rituraj ...Ritu meaning season in Sanskrit/Hindi. What does Rutu even mean ?,2
Really not a fan of gavaskars commentary he just comes across as rude,2
Dhoni never wants to bat early. Maybe he didn't want to in semi finals too.,2
[Fawad Ahmed also forgot to take his bat out one time](https://youtu.be/byXma7WfjD4),4
[deleted],14
"If Jadhav hits a four/six while Aakash Chopra is on commentary, he will call him ""chota packet, bada dhamaka"" for sure.",9
What a great pick Tewatia is for RR. Big upgrade over Lomror.,5
And Rayudu goes to Twitter again and talks about 4D this time,5
"Look Dhoni‚Äôs plan is always to come in so late that if he fails, you can‚Äôt blame him because the match was gone already. If he does it, it‚Äôs a miracle.

Like how hard is this to see for folks is beyond me!",13
HAHA THIS IS YOUR THALA....hiding behind a debutant when the team is in need. I'm sure he'll even send Jadeja before coming out.,8
Scenes if CSK lose this match by 70-80 runs,3
We exposed later in last IPL this time in 2nd match.,1
For once in my life I'd like to see Dhoni actually come in the first 10,7
Kedar.. seriously are u kidding me in this situation. Even Jaddu could've been sent,1
No wonder Tewatiya is from Haryana,3
Where is Rayudu?,3
"Sunny is being a real dick. Leave the guy alone ffs, what was he supposed to do when run rate is 14 per over? He doesn‚Äôt have the luxury to keep his dick in his hand like the commentators.",5
Jadhav! you've never done anything for this team. this is your turn... give us something.,1
doesn't csk have any replacements for Vijay and Jadhav? like seriously man wtf,3
Poor Jadhav didn't know he had to go and bat for his pension.,9
Just try and avoid losing by a big margin now to avoid a shitty NRR,1
Dhoni probably testing how much max he can get paid per ball faced,11
If Dhoni sends jadeja next....,10
CSK going for that positive net run rate.,5
Sunny uncle off his meds again,6
All tuk tuk only remaining. Missing Raina and Rayudu.,4
Lmao Faf smiling after that wicket... probably thinking *this dumb shit..*,20
This must have felt worse than Covid for Gaekwad,4
Dhoni will definitely look bad if csk loses this game.,10
I don't think Dwayne Bravo wil play even when he is injury free considering the form of Curran.,15
I think this is the part where CSK start batting practice for next match,13
"Piyush Jadeja got cunted in this ground. How is Tewatia and Gopal bowling good.

Or its just Csk does not have enough firepower. They are probably a good team for 160 chases but not 200.",2
Why does Sunil Gavaskar always sound so condescending?,10
MSD will come at the end and then post 2015 MSD fans will say he didn't have anybody by his side otherwise he would have won it. LOL,12
Twatia,3
I'm willing to bet my left testicle that jadeja will come before dhoni here,13
"Top commentary by Sunny Gavaskar 

He can't believe the batsman trying to hit a six with required rate going to 15 while was appreciating Vijay's single and doubles",7
How come CSK spinners were getting smacked all around but RR bowlers are getting wickets,5
"As an RCB fan, I have seen this movie before. RRR 13.6 for 10 overs and they chase it.",10
Dhoni will come after 5-6 wickets would have fallen so that he can have license to play dot balls,10
"Welp, this match is over",1
[deleted],-1
Dhoni planning on how to reduce quantum of loss,7
"People pissed off at Sunny because he's harsh at the batsman, just take a look at your own comment history?",7
Where is the fake finisher?,6
Dhoni 40 (20) incoming,0
Why you cum forward dombos?,0
"Now all RR needs to do is not get a wicket. Want to bowl Samson, Smith, Miller, Do it. But don‚Äôt get a wicket.",3
"Tewatiya to Sammy boi: *Oi terri to dadhi bhi nahi hai, nikal yahan se pencho*",1
"Dhoni is singing ""wake me up when September (16th over) ends""",2
Why isn't Dhoni out there in the middle yet. He did this against MI too. Is he playing as a specialist captain this time?,2
Anyone wants to take a guess at the NRR after this match? I think -2.5.,2
I'm guessing thisis  part of Dhoni's famous 5-D chess that his fans talk about and I'm too dumb to understand.,10
"need 13.5 runs per over, and casually tapping it down the ground for a single. insane approach this.",4
Has Dhoni lost confidence on himself,3
NationWantsToKnow Where is MSD?,1
csk missing Rayudu here,3
Why are csk playing again when kkr hasn‚Äôt played yet. I never understand how these formatting works,1
This is Kedar jadhav‚Äôs territory. Playing to reduce the quantum of loss.,2
"Maybe dhoni is scared, doesnt trust himself anymore",3
Rayudu's injury is costly for CSK.,5
Dhoni is playing the long con. Waiting for Unadkat's two overs,14
"Jesus, this sub is acting like this is the IPL finals. Chill machan, just a league match. Have to lose sometimes too.",7
Unadkunt to bowl next. It would be horrendous to leave him for death.,6
"Say what you may, but I low-key like most of the Dream 11 commercials, even the previous season ones.",4
CSK need exactly what MI scored in that game against KXIP!,2
Piyush chawla will come in to bat before dhoni.,3
[removed],4
"Thala showing his true colour. He knows he can't bat against quality bowlers. He needs bowlers like umesh , siraj ect",2
Wow you guys are toxic af against Dhoni. Pipe down.,4
Seriously kedar hit a six for compensation and then get the hell out,3
"I feel MSD cares too much about his image, he doesnt want to be seen as an old timer. That's why he's coming in so late",8
Is there any chance Raina returns mid season??,1
Tewatia taking wickets then celebrating like a Chewatiya.,1
At this rate rayudu will bat next,3
Tewatia gonna give CSK players nightmares ala Warnie ans Sachin,2
"Thinking about what's going through ruturaj  mind right now , dude must gutted for his life",3
So the plan here is to reduce margin of defeat?,3
"2011 WC Dhoni : Muralitharan is bowling I should go before man in godly form because I suit the situation


2019- Current Dhoni: Netflix and Chill.",15
Tevatia's action is good,3
Where is Jadeja? He played well last game. Why is Jadhav ahead?,2
Now it should be clear whose decision was it for Dhoni to come down the batting order in 2019 WC semi final.,2
Tewatia looks like he has the same personality as Harbhajan Singh,3
The commentators mentioned that only two players (Watto and MSD)  in the CSK lineup have a strike rate over 130. That's pretty shocking tbh.,6
This score is 20 runs short of the CSK template,1
This is hard to look at.,7
Seems like Dhoni has found a good use for Curran. Happy to see him doing well he's a talented young git.,5
What a horrible captaincy by Ko.. oh wait a minute,5
Remember the dhoni-jadhav match they player vs ENG in wc?,1
Abhi Thala sirf Dream 11 ke ad pe chauka maar sakte hain.,0
I‚Äôm not a Dhoni hater. But I get annoyed when these commentators still talk like Dhoni is still a big power hitter. He hasn‚Äôt been for about 7 years,3
"Lungi, gaikwad chawla already under fixing doubts by bcci",3
[deleted],-1
"Look man, this is only an option but you could give Ngidi a chance. I‚Äôm just saying, the dude would like to hit or break something after that last over.",2
You would like to think Dhoni is in next but there is a reason you haven't won all the 3 ICC trophies,3
Watching Samson extend his leg while keeping makes me feel how Dhoni has changed wicketkeeping forever.,8
"> Most runs scored in last 10 overs in a successful run chase in IPL: 133 by MI vs KXIP, Mumbai, Wankhede Stadium, 2019. CSK require 135

Needs a record chase.",2
"Sunnys criticism was absolutely valid, why the fuck would gaikwad would run down the pitch like a madman on his first ball.",3
If it was any other team I would rule them out. But since it‚Äôs csk I will hold my judgement for a few more overs,3
Man faf wtf,2
Oh my god why did jadhav come in place of dhoni,2
I guess CSK should embrace the loss and try to go as near as the score to get a better runrate?,2
People need to calm down with the hate boner for Dhoni,3
That Forward Defense by Du Plessis. Wow! He could handle Ashwin in Nagpur the way he‚Äôs playing Spin.,3
[removed],3
Graeme Swann is annoying as shit,1
Reminds me of the Ind-Nz world cup match where Jadhav shit the pants,4
"KP: ""we know how destructive Jadhav can be""

The only destruction he can cause is to CSK's chances of winning",18
I am cheering RR but singles is making me angry.,3
Just hit sixes lmao,2
"Hop on guys, we're gonna search for some FUCKING INTENT",4
Csk's chase was wholly balanced on Curran hitting 6 every second ball.,4
"Have a great feeling we're gonna see a Dhoni outburst in one of post match interviews when he's gonna asked "" why you didn't came to bat up the order"" and that poor guy might be Murali Karthik at recieving end. üòÇüò≠",1
Nice strike rotation by these two.,2
hahahaha i just remembered we let jadhav into our wc playing 11. mess.,3
"Watson had a good hit, drop Vijay and trust Gaikwad to open with Watson. Bring Hazlewood for Lungi.",3
This is just 5D chess from Dhoni. You can‚Äôt blame him to tuk tuk if all the other batsman do tuk tuk,8
du plessis wants to draw this match,2
Don't you just love when you get a shower thought? Like 'you know what would make a great post wicket celebration? Standing with my fingers in my ears!',4
we gonna take singles and doubles and reach the target...,3
Dhoni setting himself up to hit 2 sixes off the final over while csk lose by 75 runs.,31
CSK has just lost all hopes.,8
Looks like CSK has already accepted it's faith,8
Noice play. Milking singles.,2
Sunny is piling on the CSK memes,3
Seems like Dhoni's cricketing mind has gone downhill over the last 2 years or so.,8
Take it deep with all your might. Nothing is gonna happen.,5
Sometimes I don‚Äôt understand cricket,3
seriously KP commentary has to be the worst shit ever.,-1
Du plesi need to fire. Like now.,3
Chennai will have to bowl sides out for around 160. There are not going to bat their way to the title. I still think they will be potent in the second of the tournament when pitches will get slower like in Chennai.,2
Dhoni smartly hiding in the dressing room so that fans can‚Äôt blame his batting for the loss.,10
if you're not coming in this sort of situation to guide and lead the batting you may as well respectfully hand over captaincy  and watch the match from the dugout my good sir,10
I miss Sam Curran's batting already.,6
"Everyone is playing like RCB, except RCB.",6
"When unadcut will come on, dhoni will retire the on crease batsman to bring himself. And then retire in next over",5
What is the game plan here? Do they even have one?,4
*He might get exposed if he faces many balls as possible*,4
"""Fuck dem Star Sports graphics guys""

-Dhoni probably",5
"That's it huh ? 





It's a wrap for today bois, #HALLABOL üíù",4
Don't you just love it when players take their time to a start when the RR is fucking 14,8
What is CSK's plan?,2
"Maybe Dhoni himself asked Shastri to be sent at 7 in semis.
Bangar got scapegoated lol",2
why does the match bot have a rcb flair?,3
WHERE IS THE INTENT,1
Sunny ‚Äú36 off 176‚Äù Gavaskar providing his thoughts on how to chase a big score.,10
"Guys guys hear me out

What if üò≥...... Dhoni Tuk tuküòéüòé

You may laugh now",5
csk trying to improve RR from second match. 5D chess,3
Dhoni gives me anxiety,6
Small cricket ground to r/cricket: bitch you were saying?,2
That boundary you saw rn? That's the best Jadhav can do.,3
"KP: We all know how destructive Jadhav can be

Jadhav: *gently places the ball leg side for a single*",6
"Now I am 100% sure,
It was Dhoni's decision to bat at 7 in WC Semifinal.",15
"Last 5 years of his cricketing career, when you really needed him, Dhoni was not there. In my book, that's his legacy",3
Ok CSK is just playing for NRR at this point. I‚Äôm gonna turn off the match and watch something else that‚Äôs more interesting,2
CSK players still waiting for the dew to set in!,3
Kedar Jadhav has a strike rate of 99 in overs7-15. That‚Äôs less than a run a ball.!!!,5
"Tbh RR still have 2 overs of Unadkat, anything can happen.",2
After blm movement fair and lovely is glow and lovely. Fair and handsome is glow and handsome.,-3
"While I agree Gaekwads decision was dumb as hell, if he made good contact they'd be calling him Pant 2.0. That kind of madness is high risk high reward",2
finally some intent.,2
I think CSK players are dyslexic and they think target is 127,7
Gopal's action goofy af,6
Is that smriti mandhana?,5
"Dhoni might not be the big hitter he used to be, but IPL Dhoni is a different beast altogether. Something about Chennai just drives him....",3
"2020 be like: you are RCB, you are RCB, you all are RCB.",6
Someone tell Faf he isn't chasing for SA.,5
Wait Rayudu isn't playing? Wtf!,4
CSK are gonna struggle in the beginning with fresh pitches but will finish strongly at the end. The win over MI was crucial.,1
Jadhav: YA R/CRICKET! TALK NA,3
KP making up for no cheerleaders,4
Jadhav completes his quota of boundaries for the next 5 matches here,10
Drink a shot every time KP says the word go,5
"Those who thought India lost WC semis because thala didn‚Äôt come to the crease sooner, where y‚Äôall at?",6
Jadhav‚Äôs hamstring hanging on by a thread rn,9
Finally,2
[deleted],3
MSD's role in IPL 2020 = Darren Sammy's role in CPL 2020,1
Kedar earning his wages,3
Lmao Jadhav has no strength in those straw arms,1
"Gopala Gopala , fas gaya re Gopala",4
"Kedar ""Sachin Tendulkar"" Jadhav",-1
Kedar 'Street smart' jhadav.,2
my maan Jadhav gone berserk,2
cmon Jadhav do this Tewatia,1
Gopal is shit,1
Jhadav showing some intent. Finally.,6
[deleted],3
Commentators  - don't jinx it now,3
What was Jadhav last inning of Substance? I can only remember his match winning six against MI on one leg.,3
Kedar Tendulkar!,1
But but but... dHonI gIVeS oPpOrtUnITy tO YoUngSTeRs,6
Shud i sleep or is the game still on considering Unadkat has 2 overs left n Dhoni seems in no mood to bat?,2
"Kedar ""street smart"" jadhav",5
"alexa play, *mera hi jalwa*",2
Does willow have their own commentators or are they just broadcasting Star Sports' commentary?,3
Dhoni playing the role of non playing captain to perfection,12
You Spinner. I Hit.,3
Jadhav with steve smith like stance,3
"its about what you have in between your ears..

mask?",4
Dhoni reminds me of when I captained my class team. Thought I was the best batsman; decided to hold myself back as a finisher; came in at number 9 to a lost cause; watched helplessly as number 11 slogged the last ball of the over instead of blocking it.,20
"Are all players saying ""fuck off r/cricket""?",4
r/cricket continuing the reverse jinx,3
"Jadhav'""s üëå taller than the stumps.",2
Jadhav kinda looks like sachin‚Äôs mum... no? Only me?,1
Faf playing the anchor role!,5
3 boundaries and we still haven‚Äôt gotten the RRR üôÇ,10
Time for Smith to bowl himself and get this back under control,9
Faf only faced 11 balls? Felt like he was there forever,6
Only Andre Russell can chase this down,9
One 25+ over and they're back in the game tbh.,5
Feel like shit only want my thakur back,10
Some how the replays give off a every early IPL (2008-11) vibes,3
Fast runners like Kohli or Jaddu would've tried to push for two there,3
Picking up some pace now I guess,3
Short man with massive biceps. It's like some shitposter's meme has come to life in Jadhav,3
[deleted],1
TIL Jadhav can bat without an injured hamstring when playing for CSK,3
Faf has to start hitting too. Can't play run a ball here my guy,6
"Troll dhoni more please.


I can have hope.",3
Let's give it to Unadkat now.,3
Jadhav not buying into ‚Äútake it deep‚Äù. Needs to be removed from the team!,6
"Jadhav 18 (10)

du Plessis 10 (12)

r/Cricket: Fuck Jadhav, wtf is he doing?",7
"Csk could have won if it was a 190 target, 217 is just too much",2
"116 in 8 , I mean why bother Even playing.",4
Predict CSK's final score. I go for 202/8.,1
Csk is the Barca of IPL.,4
Lord Unadkat has 2 overs left,2
du plessis has given up,4
It would be fun if dhonis comes out now and wins this match for csk.,4
Kohli must be really really expensive to not be in the dream 11 ad,10
That advertisement with the zebra taunting msd is so annoying....I wanna murder that fucking donkey zebra,3
Remember that one time when Watson got hamstrung against Bangladesh and then just went on to hit 15 sixes enroute to 180 something? Maybe CSK can get ideas for a strategy from that.,7
Someone from RR needs to do a Jordan to make the game exciting for us!,2
Dhoni Dhoni Dhoni,-1
Here comes CSK only hope,3
CSK are losing it. Aren't they?,2
Hope dhoni can chime in and get csk to 200 atleast to make it more interesting,3
Unadkad‚Äôs got 2 left. Take mandatory 45 from unadkad. The game is still on.,3
"Swanny needs to shut the fuck up, I can tell Lee is getting annoyed",3
"Just got back very please with Scurran strike rate, thats all I was pleased with",2
I think we‚Äôve got a little chance here lads.,5
[deleted],4
"They have exhausted all their spinners, will smith let smith bowl",2
Undacunt with Intent‚Ñ¢,2
"Required rate is over 14 now, someone's going to have to play a blinder if CSK are to pull this off. My guess is they're waiting for Curran to come back. Wait.. Here's Unadkat... have to go",2
So Dhoni knew this pitch was going to get slow and still decided to bowl and his bowlers bowled overpitched deliveries. Can't understand how this happened,8
What a cringefest!,1
"From here on, if CSK scores at 15 an over they will win with 2 balls to spare",3
Please stop jfc,1
C'mon faf bang unadkat..,1
Good thinking completing Unadkat overs now,3
This match doesn't look like CSK won the toss.,2
"Define what is finisher in cricket?

Dhoni: Finisher is someone who comes in for bat after the game is finished.",17
Play for the win you cowards,10
Why is nobody criticizing Faf?,3
These fan videos are cringe,3
Dhoni‚Äôs moment of truth is right here.,3
Raina 89(23). CSK will win with an over to spare.,1
Faf with the 1s and 2s! Sunny G approves!,3
The IPL really suffers from lack of a POD,2
"Dhoni doesn't trust his own batting ability, it seems. Either comes in with too little to do or too much, so can't be blamed.",3
Vipul Wade that's cringe man!,6
"Imagine working for Cred, and they ask you to make a cringe video for IPL or no promotion!",8
My cringe is off the roof,5
I think they've given up,3
RR will be hard to beat with Stokes and Buttler.,3
Smith outsmarted Dhoni who is planning to feast on Unadkat.,12
No intent,2
Wtf are you still taking singles for.,2
I N T E N T,2
INTENT INTENT INTENT,2
KP taking a big L here.,1
Jaddu is padded up so no Dhoni next wicket down,1
"Rr playing a masterstroke here

Finishing unadkat before death",1
2rupees on MS leaving one outside off when equation is 101 off 17. #batdeep,12
"If Jadhav gets out Jadeja will come out. 

If du plessis gets out Dhoni will come out.",1
RRR 15+ fml,2
This is what happens when you chose to field first literally every match. I don't even remember the last time csk batted first,1
imma rage if unadkat gets away with anything below 10rpo,2
Missing the intent^TM,1
People chanting Dhoni here as if he's the same finisher what he used to be earlier.,2
I witnessed the strongest thunderstorm of my life wtf is wrong in mumbai + vasai virar area my cricket is paused since an hour,3
Unadkat seems to go into deep introspection while walking back to his runup,2
"ms coward hiding in the dugout, he pissed his pants seeing the target",7
can y‚Äôall just hit out and make this entertaining,8
What's Faf trying to do here? At least get Jadeja in if you can't do shit.,7
"This innings by Faf reminds me of Dhoni-Jadhav's partnership vs England in WC 2019 hahaha 

No intent",14
"Hey guys, intent",5
We got ms and jaddu to play for nrr. Hit you cowards,2
Kedar has been showing intent.... no he isn't... lmao,6
Jayadev Unadkat is a champion at defending 210+ totals with his slower balls..,17
The game is done already,7
lol @ RRR,4
faf pulls exactly like abd,1
Imagine taking singles off Unadkat when 15 rpo is needed,6
Pieterson making me hate commentary and sockless looks. Showing his intent,2
Omg dhoni is not even in the dug out. Pure shit.,3
KP wit da roasts,2
Faf nailing singles,3
Dhonis not even padded up. Seems it's gonna be Jadeja in next,4
"With all the praise of Fleming one thing for sure Dhoni is the one who makes call in CSK. Remember when Fleming in comm in 2018 Asia Cup was saying in one of matches "" Ofcourse dhoni should come up the order and play most deliveries"". And I knew 2019 WC gonna be spicey üòÇüò≠",0
Slower bowls into the pitch to win. Thank me later!,1
CSK has no plans of trying to win here. They will just bore us to death while trying to reduce the quantum of loss.,3
Will joss play this ipl. RR seems balanced,7
"Out of loop: What is this ""Quantum of loss"" everyone talking about?",3
"Where does KP sleep when he goes camping?

**I N T E N T**",14
Deeper and deeper and deeper,3
I know KP and intent usually gets annoying but he's right here.,3
When u need six per ball & csk goes six per over...,5
Unadkat has probably earned more than 50-60 crores already in his IPL career till now.  Man's been the luckiest cricketer in terms of performance and rewards.,3
"Bhosdike maar... Kya maa chuda raha hai tuk tuk karke!

T: hit 6 brother!",1
No other sport can frustrate me like cricket,3
Does csk even want to win this?,8
"Give him a slower wicket, Unadkat starts to look like Wasim Akram.",7
Good running between the wickets,2
I have muted the sound on the TV and I am enjoying the game more than when i was hearing the fan noise and the cancermentory,3
CSK just casual with singles with a 15+ RRR,6
"Arey BC, Jaddu is padded to come next if a wicker falls. What is Dhoni doing??",3
Damn! I know CSK will lose this game but atleast make it little entertaining.,3
Post match presentation with Dhoni is gonna be so interesting.,0
"100 more wides, plizz.",2
This umpire must be rolling in pussy,2
Why is this thread more entertaining than match?,3
"If left to KP, he would probably go down to the pitch and show INTENT.",5
Boundary or out you cowards,2
Faf is the Imposter,4
This is getting to be like that WC19 game of ours against England where we just gave up during the death overs and tried reducing the margin of defeat.,1
"I don't give a fuck what you think, i am not gonna bat today. ~ Dhoni.",2
Yes play out Unadcut. Definitely the way to go,7
I am pretty sure it's Jadeja next up,4
"RR will win the Indian Premier Leauge mark my words, it  would be an absolute walk in the park if they had stokes and butler",4
I N T E N T,6
Match is over. Y'all can sleep now.,6
Imagine srh's middle order chasing this total,4
I'm gonna shout on behalf of this entire sub. INTENT X 100000,4
"If you are not going to hit Unadkat, good luck.",5
Lol.. absolute shit batting.. who the fuck makes strategies in CSK..,4
"Apparently Dhoni isn't padded up?

Surely this is the best time for him to come out for some net practice like he did at Lord's and Edgbaston against England",10
C'mon unadkat be a good sport & help out your ex-teammates here,3
How can you waste hitting Unadkat,5
WTF THESE BATSMEN ARE DOING,4
Unadkat and jadeja bowling at the same speed ffs,1
Faf playing worse than VJ,0
This is bring back WC19 PTSD,5
"Kevin ""Bumrah is arguably the best bowler in the world, no debate "" Pieterson",10
Can this dude shut up about intent,8
"Guys you don't understand, if we avoid the follow on in the first innings here we may have a shot in the end",6
"Hello mama, I'd like a couple dozen no balls please.",7
"CSK already accepted the loss, playing for NRR",5
"Dhoni isn't padded, so that means this is all long term plans",3
Should‚Äôve played with shardul thakur and have him open. Match would‚Äôve been over in 10 overs.,2
Brilliant stuff from unadcut !,3
CSK will definitely miss Raina going forward in to the tournament.,8
Du Plessis is the new dhoni,7
what r we waiting for,2
Dhoni don't want to do a yuvi. He wants to retire at high. Will bat after Chahar imo,11
Cricbuzz says Dhoni isn't padded up.,3
"Every time KP talks about I N T E N T, CSK takes a single",8
They‚Äôre just taking singles off of RR‚Äôs worst bowler,4
6 of unadkat over XD,3
"lol wth was that over, don‚Äôt they know they need 15 an over",3
intent not found. thought IPL was all about entertainment. this is a bag of bollocks.,5
Oh my goodness KP please stop talking,4
Jadeja and dhoni left to take the game to victory after this. WC semifinal flashbacks,2
Yawn,1
This is being done my the team which won most fair play awards,2
"Good idea from MS. If Jadhav and Du Plessis can see out till tea, then Dhoni can attack in the final session as the light is fading.

First innings lead is 1 point, no?",11
111 off 44. Easy math,4
What‚Äôs going on they‚Äôre not cunting Unadcunt,3
Solid test match batting here,6
Time for the CSK players to check their blood pressure,3
Yee will see cummo tomorrow,3
Where will all the haters be when csk reaches finals?,6
[My reaction when required run rate is more than 15 with 7 over to go](https://preview.redd.it/7sxxqtrrlwc31.jpg?width=720&auto=webp&s=7e9f3a0247d47bf7b7b3ab687eaeb1dbf6e0480e),1
I think Smith should be around his team a bit more,2
"Wtf Unadkat, please play your natural game",5
Bro WTF wrong with Faf? No wonder DeKock is SA captain now üòÇüò≠,2
I bet they have given up on the chase and are just trying to minimize NRR hit.,2
Fuck this is some spineless shit from CSK. It's offensive even as a neutral,3
"It's like aus SF match in WC .

I remember I only had hope with dhoni lol.",1
"> MS Dhoni isn't padded up. He's definitely not in next. Jadeja?

wtf, MSD should come already.",5
Thats it bois just nudge the ball around. Just great!,2
"Unadkat is bowling slower ones.... @ 100kmph!! 
And they refuse to tonk him. 3D chess much?",3
The DJ should mute the crowd noise to simulate the audience sleeping,3
At this rate even the Quantum of Loss‚Ñ¢ is going up be fucking massive. Please hit.,6
RR taking a timeout to figure out why CSK batsmen won't even hit Unadkat.,13
"I thought csk was playing for the NRR, but they're not even helping that with this batting",6
Worrying about the net run rate makes these chases boring.,2
Omg why does dhoni do so many ads hasn't he made enough money with ipl,13
It will be interesting to see if CSK will play for NRR or for a win... Knowing Dhoni they might make a play for NRR.,8
Csk just want to end with 170 and rather not collapse now,8
Dada eating too much gutka,3
Even the umpire is like GTFO csk,1
Collars on T20 jerseys. Yes or no? I vote no.,0
Seems CSK have decided to play for NRR than winning the match .,8
Why is Dhoni hiding ?,1
India v England WC 2019 vibes. Love how nobody can give a single fuck.,7
If you're on the left you say teerandaaz. If you're on the right you say dhanushdhaari. Jo Archer bolta hai woh beech ka.,3
"From Cricbuzz

>MS Dhoni isn't padded up. He's definitely not in next.¬†Jadeja?

When the team's in danger with loss on cards, you as a leader shouldn't run away like a coward",4
Riyan Parag is only 18?? Hmmm,2
"So, everybody thought MI is the strongest team and RR is the weakest. Now, CSK beat MI. And, RR will be CSK.

Is this the upside down?

2020 is really weird.",8
Great banter that they introduced time outs and then had to use a gesture that wasn't the classic time out T.,3
No offence - but it's like they want to lose or don't care anymore,3
"Clear plan for RR to win - keep Faf on strike, no appeals on his dismissal",2
"Jeebus stop with the test match jokes. We get it, dhoni bad playing slow and hit 6 every ball",6
Watto and Sam Curran the only batsmen who even tried for CSK.,15
What is this uncompetitive shit bruh. Ur playing a premier tournament not in fucking local league,7
 2 quick wickets after timeout. CSK will lose by around 40 runs,3
"Dhoni still not padded up. He'll send jadeja and chahar next and come up with some bs ""chaos theory"" post match.",12
"Game's gone, they're playing for NRR now.",4
Kedar should prolly cast himself in next DABANGG movie bcoz he will get more success there,3
Hahahahahah how triggered is everyone to see the dhoni ads rn,9
Can a captain force an umpire to retire hurt a player if the player refuses to go off the field for batting too slow?,5
Till dhoni is a tail order batsmen,3
I remember CSK winning after hitting fuck all for the first 15 overs,3
Jeez. Tahir aged like crazy during the break,5
What fresh scam is this white hat junior shit,22
Dhoni masterstroke is to not play a stroke,3
"Dhoni the specialist keeper and No 8 batsman, nice tactics",6
Dhoni appears more in ads than he appears on the crease!,7
CSK gave up . They have set a total of 180 to save nrr,6
Required run Rate is 16 now. Only Umesh Yadav could save CSK ...,6
Will Kedhar Jadhav still feed Dhoni daily?,1
I am csk fan but if they let this team with so much weakness non selected team should be shamed.,2
Dhoni needs to listen to himself and go on retirement with mutual funds,5
Anyone remember that England vs South Africa game in the last World T20 cup when England chased down some monstrous score over 230? The first 4-5 overs of this game was showing me shades of that one.,3
"Rr making 216 without buttler n stokes n miller with a diammond duck

Unadkat not leaking runs

Tewatia getting on a hatrick

Good luck to other teams",3
American here. ELI5 what role do CEAT tyres play in the teams strategy,6
Dhoni went from promoting himself up the order in the World Cup Final to not even being confident enough to come out to bat for CSK.,4
Dhoni has lost confidence in his abilities over the years. This isn‚Äôt the Mahi swashbuckling Dhoni that Dada promoted at number 3 in the past. The whirlwind Dhoni who could have won it.,3
"Nagarkoti is only 173 cm tall, will he be effective in International Stage?",1
Either of rr or rcb to make it to the playoffs or even both. Srh and mi might not. Csk eventually will as always.,1
"Unadkat goes for 7: batsmen are shit!

Curran goes for 16: batsmen are on song tonight!",6
Loving the meltdown here. This is the Dhoni I missed,10
"You guys were missing dhoni, he took strategic time out so you get to see him in every ad. 5d chess",9
It's almost bizarre that CSK's highest paid player isn't out there when the chase is 217 and you are already 13 overs in.,7
"If CSK come out of the break and still don't play aggressively, KP will have a stroke",12
Peitersen more concerned about csk runrate than csk themselves.,9
"To be fair to Unadkat, he has bowled decent today. Of course, 216 helps",4
"As frustrated of Dhoni's decisions I am rn, wtf is duplessis doing?",11
Wtf faf played 15 balls for 13 what the actual fuck,6
"Chad Smith, Virgin Dhoni",1
Faf has to wake up now,8
Why is no one critisizing Faf?,1
"Atkeast BYJU's ads have class l, whitehatjr looks like scam",6
WTF running was that from both... Lol,2
"Cricket is such a great leveler not on field but off the field too, how?


Remember after 2015 WC Harsha Bhogle got wrath of Dhoni's cricticism and lost job even I was mad at Harsha that time.




Well he just tweeted "" where's dhoni"" and see the replies on that tweet üòÇüò≠üò≠üò≠",7
Intent^TM is here boys,3
"Guys fuck your rr calcs, not saying it‚Äôs easy but 3 good overs is all that‚Äôs needed. Do you remember 27 runs from 2 effing balls? 

If they‚Äôre bowling we‚Äôll and you try hitting that‚Äôs just stupid cricket. These guys know better than that 

it‚Äôs exactly why csk does so well",5
At least they got 2 this time,2
Faf hasn't seemed up for this at all,5
Why are the straight boundaries suddenly looking like the MCG's. :-/,7
INTENT,2
The word intent no longer sounds like a real word after the last 5 minutes of commentary,6
"Jadhav's running on another pitch, wish srh had done that",8
Tom literally walked out of the Peaky Blinders set this evening.,9
dude fuck the net run rate if we need it we weren‚Äôt good enough anyways,5
This is 14th over. Far du has played only 17 balls,2
Sam curran is better than tom curran.,5
Atleast kohli would never give up while chasing.,10
iNTenT,6
Dhoni about to come in the 16th over and give me anxiety,7
They need 5-6 sixes in a period of 2 overs. Who can do that?,5
Even Tom is bored,2
Has Dhoni lost his helicopter??,2
Watch them nudge for a single on a FH.,5
"Sam ""2 shots"" Curran",4
Murali karthik saying vijay set the tempo for csküò≠üò≠,6
Go on tom,3
Could this freehit be the catalyst that sends them on a rampage?,6
Rooting for faf to block the free hit ball,5
So many no balls this season. Bookies screaming is happiness rn,1
But he came forward?,1
IN-FUCKING-TENT FFS STFU,1
I can't believe my eyes Unda cut actually seems to be bowling better this season!,2
Jadhav playing garba in slow mo,2
Did Sam cut Tom's hair as a prank? There is no way Tom paid to get that hairdo,2
Free hit. Use this to rotate strike lads with a quick single,4
Jadhav jumped 4 feet in air,1
"Remember when Dhoni came to bat at 7 in the WC semi-final and we were all surprised like WTF?

I think today is the part 2 of that joke!",3
"As an RCB fan this is not over.

Also I would like to thank my PTSD therapist",4
"Something's never change. Kohli continuing to play Umesh, Sanju Samson hitting a reckless shot when well set and Dhoni being a coward in a big run chase.",5
What a good use of free hit,4
This is why faf was not slogging... Lol,7
Even the free hit hasn't changed anything smh,9
"I love you for surrey tom, but please stop being so unreliable (note good sometimes) on the world stage",4
Do you not wish to smoke the same typa weed that Murali Karthik smokes?,4
"This one is not working, get a new bat Faf.",6
Plenty of blame to go around but I think the worst culprit has been Faf. Never attempted a big shot even to full tosses from the spinners.,4
three overs of 20+ runs and boom they'll be back.,8
Jesus this is boring,1
Nice,1
Oh shit man,1
Nice take,1
Lmao,1
Faf properly learned from MSD's school of tuk tuk.,4
Oh god Sanju Samson u killer,2
What a catch that!!!!!,6
Holy fuck great catch,3
Dhoni time boys!!,1
Du plessis is even worse,3
Faf du is just not able to connect on slowish wicket,3
Ya fucking dumdums,3
Maybe I should also go bust my stick,3
WHAT A CATCH,7
Bye jhadhav,1
Samson is already preparing his player of the match speech.,5
toplol du plessis striking at less than run a ball.,2
Faf looking so out of touch for a guy who just scored 50 the other day.,2
[removed],8
Faf changing bat to hit 6 sixes in next lol.,3
Samson is everywhere today,8
"Look man, I just want Dhoni to come in.",2
INB4 jaddu does a CWC19 semi,1
Ab agar dhoni nahi aiya to I'll lose my shit,2
Du plessis is even worse,0
Brilliant catch,4
By the courtesy of Peaky fookin' blinders,3
Nice catch,3
Now Dhenier to score a cool 15(23),8
Faf has hit no boundaries in this innings üò≥,2
"Fuck yeah, faf changing his bat now come at us bitches.",8
I hope dhoni comes in and gives a good show atleast,2
superman stuff from samson,5
Wtf that was a really good catch,5
Ganju MOTM,4
Dhoni dhoni dhoni dhoni dhoni please pad up,4
Jadeja time I guess.,2
Great catch!,5
MSD,3
wait what. it's not a dot,2
What is it with my teams and their lack of intent,3
"**13.4** Curran to Jadhav, OUT,  **114-5**

KM Jadhav c &dagger;Samson b Curran 22 (16b 3x4 0x6) SR: 137.50",3
"Hits sixes and takes blinders for fun, this guy",7
Inb4 chahar at 7,1
Samson is gold today,4
Can dhoni come in now,1
Pant couldn‚Äôt have done that,6
Good take that. What a salmon,2
Kedar going to replace selmon bhai,2
Ah this is the match where they decided to convince doubters that IPL isn't fixed or scripted!,7
So much suspense bc,2
Well well well,2
RR is making CSK look super old here,2
Excited to see 12 ball 15 from Dhenier,7
Yessss dhoni,3
"Why is everyone panicking?

They still have two more days to bat. All they need to do is dig in and bat till stumps.",13
I‚Äôm actually surprised Dhoni came out.,3
Why Currans always so angry,2
Dhoni hate in this sub is just disgusting.,0
Finally,3
Finally,3
I honestly want a 75 s/r Dhoni inning rn to see what it does to this sub,17
My 2 rupees on Jadeja coming in,4
"JEEZ, SANJU WHAT WAS THAT",4
strap in boys! we winning this...,3
"I still think that CSK can win , all they have to do is score 1 run more than RR's total score .",7
Holy shit Dhoni finally came,3
The finisher is here.,3
Limp dick hoick from Faf,3
"It's not about winning, it's all about giving your everything till the end.",2
"Pietersen is such a hypocrite. Damn, i miss him on field",3
Today is Sanju's day. That catch was a beauty.,5
"Dhoni unfair towards Jadeja, why didn't he let him bat?",2
What'll Dhoni do now anyway. Take us to 160?,3
Ab kya ukhadna hai ab to lag gayi lanka,1
Faf wearing pink gloves. Do we have an imposter here?,3
CSK's net runrate is going to take a worse beating than ngidi in the 20th over,3
Faf has been on the crease forever now!,3
You just get the impression KP starts every sentence subconsciously and then his brain has to try work out where to go with it once he realises he's talking,8
Dhoni will lose a lot of cred if he doesn't walk in,8
The cringe is next level,3
I want Dhoni to shit the bed ONLY to get Star sports to shut the fuck up about Dhoni,9
All those who commented that Jaddu is coming up and Dhoni is hiding must be busy in deleting their comments right now hahaha,8
Is that Ana de Armas?,3
I've always found Samson great behind the stumps but some people say Pant is better than him.,2
Cant wait for some Chahar action,1
All this suspense. Only imagine if he gets out for a duck,2
Faf is a disgrace fucker need to retire,-2
"Wait is Dhoni coming out to bat???

This is a miracle.",2
Dhoni comes to play a 130ish striking innings so he can't be blamed.,6
Dhoni finally,1
Attention ! Colonel Dhoni on deck !,3
Finally.,2
Dhoni to leave his first 5 balls but to show the lads his banter is quality,7
I hope csk don't fck up their NRR.,4
"Faf: We are chasing this?

MS: Nah.",25
Why does Dhoni wear pads that he bought from a Max Max memorobillia auction,8
Wtf is Dhoni even doing. He should lead the charge,7
Finally..Time for some action now please.,2
A 10 ball fifty from Dhoni helps.,8
Faf still below 100sr......lmao,6
Man of the Match Sanju Samson?,9
Dhoni didn't make 100 runs off 1 ball? Shame,3
If Csk win this I will enroll myself into Whitehead Jr.,15
3 from 11 balls innings incoming.,13
Dhoni came in early,14
"Thank fuck something happened, was about to rewatch desert storm highlights for the third time today, not that I mind it.",8
Sanju baba's day today,9
"Dhoni in, guess some people are busy eating their own shit.",-5
"RR fan since the beginning of IPL, but I will be happy as fuck if dhoni wins this fro CSK somehow.",9
Tuk tuk,5
who dis newbie at no. 7 in CSK,7
Incoming 21 of 20 balls.,10
Idk why but I've a strong feeling that Faf and Dhoni are going to finish things off and win the match for CSK,1
Lmao dhoni is going to play another test innings and his fans are going to defend it saying he was playing for the NRR..,3
Finally,1
I'm just here for the Dhoni hate train,13
Pathetic showcase from CSK. Bunch of old men who'll grab their backs if the target is above 180,5
Remember there was a chase from here against rcb in 2018,5
Unadkat can do Umesh and turn the game in CSK's favor,3
"This looks like KKR last year , leaving too much for Russell and the madlad would almost do it every time",6
4 wicket haul for Curran,5
Ye to Maharaj khud padhare hain! Mein ascharya chakit ho gaya.,3
100 off 37 is like Afridi level shit. Fuck.,3
rrr is 17/over.,0
"Natural diamonds are propaganda, I like my diamonds artificial.",2
"2 stumpings and a catch.

Not too shabby with the bat either...


Guys.. 

Samson might be the MOTM here.",1
Ohh man if Dhoni plays like Faf.. KP is just going to go on the field and kill them both.,3
Dhoni - The fearful Batter !,2
"5-115, 6 more overs to go. Dhoni can afford to take his time here",3
We are due some fireworks courtesy Big D.,1
Dhoni‚Äôs first run in 400 days comes off a misfield,3
Dhoni's SR prediction at the end of the innings?,1
Come on MS. Cunt the cunt.,2
Captain cool 30 of 18 balls incoming (12 came from last over),6
Dhonut exposed,3
"That is the most animated Samson has ever been, he was quieter when celebrating the 100 he got couple of years ago",5
CRED advert is great,2
Commentators - Dhoni,2
Kedhar sacrifices himself for his master Dhoni,2
u/SalivaForThalaiva urgently needed,9
Thalla in the house - Waiting for the thread to explode.,2
[deleted],3
6(9),3
what a shithousery chase so far.,4
Dhoni showing good INTENT,3
100 needed in 6 overs .. maybe a bit too much ?,2
Dhoni,2
">Dhoni doesn't come in : Coward, Running away
>Comes In: Tuktuk, dhobi, etc etc",6
"Hmmm, they are going to play for their NRR aren't they?",4
"It's ""Quantum"" time, lads",3
Man of the Match - Du Plessis?,3
"If CSK reduce the margin to even 40 runs, it will be a miracle.",5
Did only Kohli took care of his fitness in the quarantine? Every other Indian cricketer has turned into a fatass,10
imagine being a pussy at bat and still getting out,3
Yeah man Thala 10(21) masterclass is all that CSK needs rn,6
"It seems to me that all the commentators can say is ""hur dur dur why don't they just smack it?"" as if they have never struggled to hit the ball.",2
"I'd say the game is over and done but I'm pretty sure CSK have won a game from a RRR per over of 17, so, we'll see?",1
Watta single by dhoni,3
Cunt can't even hit a freehit ball in the fucking slot with such short boundries with the rrr over 17,2
This exactly is the right time to nurdle the ball around.,2
Lol @ people think Dhoni will do anything worthwhile here. He hasn't played an innings like that for half a decade now.,9
CSK's batting is weak AF. Remove FAF and bring in Dawid Malan,5
he is not even what he was last season *sobs*,3

Cunt can't even hit a freehit ball in the fucking slot with such short boundries with the rrr over 17,3
That fellow in the Century laminates ad is the same guy that played the Ultra Simp Pro Max cop character in Kahaani movie.,3
Go faf,3
"I don't know and I can check on cricbuzz but..


Where is Rayudu?",4
TV's still down cause of the rain. I'm glad RR are winning this but I'm kinda mad I'm not able to watch the ONE MATCH they'll actually win smh,2
"Dhoni on fire today guys, made 2 runs",5
Dhoni is gonna let Faf take a chance and if he gets out he'll go after I bet.,2
this non-attempt is definitely not a pretty sight considering that both of these teams were banned before lol,5

Cunt can't even hit a freehit ball in the fucking slot with such short boundries with the rrr over 17,1
Hit this guy for 4 more sixes please. I want some entertainment,4
Can't catch for shit! Faf to give them tuitions!,3
I don‚Äôt think there is a match anymore. Rest his just test cricket.,5
cool just 16 more of those,3
Its good seing dhoni in action man,1
Dhoni came early the match is still winable.,6
Tewatia deserves to get the living daylights hit out of him for those shit celebrations earlier.,14
BBL fielding,5
Any bets on Dhoni's SR at end of this innings ?,2
*INTENT*,5
Dhoni with that 50SR lmao,4
Some say murali vijay left the stadium and went to abu dhabi market to find the thing KP calls intent,11
Faf would have caught that,11

Lmao thala can't score in the field so they're showing his training sixes,1
No way Dhoni pulls this off,2
dey thevidiya... stop saying bad words...,-2
Dhoni already gave up and NRR is only thing in his mind right now lol.,4
Cunt can't even hit a freehit ball in the fucking slot with such short boundries with the rrr over 17,1
"Guys. If CSK scored 17 runs an over, they might win this.",3
"Idk why the commentators are freaking out, 17 an over is totally gettable, I do it all the time in stick cricket",15
"CSK risks irking Srinimama.
Srinimama says fuck it and bares all the fixing stories in twitter",3
Tewatia looks like a guy who might even bash his teammate for dropping a catch lmao,9
Reading these IPL threads makes it seem like the good old times...Missed all the entertainment in these threads,11
CSK will play good only against Mi and rcb,8
Dropping Du Plessis good tactics.,2

"Tewatia was like ""pardon me sir mind telling me why you dropped that one""",9
"I see Dhoni on the pitch, Is it 19th over already?",9
Tewatia has more INTENT than entire CSK team.,15
Dhoni is no way fit to lead a T20 team. The guy can't hit the ball...at all,7
Only Chawla can get them home from here,2
I'm gonna be honest here. Dhoni hasn't been vintage Dhoni since 2014 T20 World Cup.,6
"85 from 5 overs doesn't look that bad, am I right?",8
Tewatia: Oyeee FUCKKKKKKKKKK,6
At this rate fair play is the only trophy we are going to get.,6

"Kartik : He's gonna take it deep


How much deeper is it gonna go lol",16
Far out or 6,1
If Faf came out to bat in only a towel CSK would've won by now just saying,4
BC how deep does Dhoni want to take it? Run rate is at almost 18 per over with around 30 balls left.,9
Dhoni's favorite batsman: Deep Dasgupta,12
Lets just scramble to 180-190 and avoid a horrible run rate for the later stage cos we definitely arent walking into the playoffs like previous years,4
Not only did dhoni come out in the space of a bowler but he is playing like one too,8
GUN PLESSIS,5
Now faf is gearing up,5
LOL did the ball went into the dustbin?,3
LOL DID THAT GO INTO THE DUSTBIN,3
Dhoni caught near the boundary incoming,6
Just came to say I noticed Steve Smith got out on 69. Nice.,19
I'm super pissed off at gaikwad. expected a lot from him.,3
In the bin lmao,11
Never imagined that one day Faf will show Dhoni how a six is hitten,11
Lmao the ball went in the bin,10
Is 20 a realistic target in the last six balls?,5
Whay does this Parag fellow do other than preen like a peacock?,4

[deleted],3
"These dummy commentators will never say that Dhoni has got something wrong. Blame faf all you want, but dhoni the finisher is a masterclass if he doesn't go after this bowler and take it deep when 90 is required of 30. Spineless KP",15

The experts here must be doing good at Fantasy Leagues,5

"Straight into the trashcan that ball, trashy ball.",4
Right in the bin,3
Is that limp dick bitches @/r/cricket - Faf Du Plessis,6
Faf yelled Kobe,6
Tewatia thinks he is Rashid Khan,7
That went inside the dustbin xD,5
It was the bat all along,2
Imo bring Archer next,3
Chawla basically lost this for CSK.,8
That six is for the cringey celebration!,7

"""Angry young man"" Tewatiya",1

Dhoni comes at around 5-6 overs left and we still have most screen time of him only lmao,5
[removed],3
Get in the bin,2
Who writes things like Faf-ulous on the screen and how do they deal with the urge to vomit every time,11
Did Dhoni cut his own hair during the quarantine? The fringe looks... different...,5
Straight to the dustbin- Faf = ABD lite confirmed,1
"If you even remotely think that this match is done and dusted, then my friend you have no idea what IPL is all about.",0
86 off 30 is just 17 an over guys. Add a couple of no balls in questionable circumstances and you have the usual IPL script.,8
Faf knows how to play when batting with tail enders,11
"Pollard, Hardik, Russell would chase this down.",0
"Faf-bulous is terrible, they should be ashamed",6
"Tuk Tuk

Misbah sends his regards",3
Tewatiya's celebrations are so shit,8
MI wanted to bat like RR batted. Then the dew wouldn't have mattered bowling second. But alas.,2
"Lmao imagine if we win this


We won't, but how funny it would be if we did",8
"In the spirit of Dhoni 'taking it deep' I'm going to start writing my tests 1 hour into the exam, and tell my teacher it was too hard in the end.",9
They need to score 17 per over.,2
Those 2 overs by chawla and the last over by Ngidi really fucked us up otherwise we had a genuine chance,4
He'd had enough of faffing around eh eh eh,3
Someone remain dhoni that jofra is not umesh Yadav.,1
4 overs - 50 runs means we needs 36 of last over. Take it Deep in play definitely.,1
Incoming over of dots and singles because they had too much action in last 3 balls,2
Dhoni knows his wicket is worth 11 wickets,4
I am expecting someone to say Du Plessis started showing intent just because Dhoni is batting with him.,10
That Ngidi over is gonna cost us dear.,9
"Guys, Unadkat has 1 over left. This game is still alive!",6
how are the commentators talking about taking it deep with a RRR of 18 üò≠üò≠üò≠,6
You need Bravo for these kinds of chases. But Curran is playing well and you can't take out the other three international players.,3
Dhoni has already started calculating for a better Nrr at end of qualifiers,10
The comments here are so fucking toxic. Calm down lads and stop shitting on every player that comes out to bat.,8
damn this could‚Äôve been winnable if that last over wasn‚Äôt dog shit,6
"Bravo did it in 2018, exact same scenario.",9
Tfw Sam Curran bats 4? Lol only in t20,0
RR is really under pressure now. 85 to get of 5 overs. Dhoni has still 2 overs to settle.,10
These csk chants need to be stopped,8

86 from 30. If they pull this off then the sub should just permanently be pics of Faf in various stages of undress,6
"12 balls from Archer and Curran, and 6 by Unadkat. If Unadkat goes for 20, can they get 66 off Archer and Curran? Highly unlikely.",4
I had decided not to watch IPL and concentrate on my GMAT but I couldn't resist! Thank you CSK for helping me ditch IPL!,11
Dhoni is so deeep only 14 year olds get him,12
"If Rayudu gets fit, I will retain Gaikwad and throw out Vijay.",7
Cha cha cha real smooth,2
Only unadkat can pull this off for csk now,6
Bowler under pressure,1
Why is Tewatia such a dick,14
When people diss Samson for his domestic records they should also take into fact that he plays for Kerala and there arent any other good batsmen for him to get a strong partnership. Plus the grounds and pitches in Kerala are not very good.,14
"**Spinners tonight**

CSK¬† 8-0-95-1 (ER 11.88)

RR¬† 8-0-75-4 (ER 9.37)",10

Can the dugout take it out of their mouths?,6
Even dugout is sucking to msd,9
How many times can you say Intent,6
I don‚Äôt care about nrr at this point. Just hit or get out,4

CSK has two and a half batsmen. Watson and Rayudu. Dhoni only on his days.,3
"That Ngidi over made all the difference, CSK would need 59 of 30 if the target was 190",2
when 4s r barely enough,2
Faf-bulous? More like Fapulous amirite?,6
Faf really playing some great shots,1
It is the hope that kills you.,5
That gold chain is trashy as hell,-10
"I remember a time when Dhoni would hit malinga, steyn for 20 runs an over. Now, it's anyone over 140  and I am afraid he's gonna get out every ball",6
"‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a terrific cricket shot‚Äù oh geeze, thank you for that insight, I thought he was talking about basketball shot",7
A test match leave now please!,1
Du Plessis WTF bro! You‚Äôre the Anchor. Don‚Äôt play Reckless!,2
Dhoni might get out in this over,6
"KP's commentary is shite. plz take him back, england.",4
Did you guys know Archer can bowl fast?,5
What happened to James Faulkner,2
Why does the pitch look shorter? Something with the camera angle,2
That was interesting fielding position.,5
"I think Joffra adds one gold ring for each year he completes as a cricketer. By the end of his career he'll be like *pachas tola, pachas tola*",10

What‚Äôs the commentators talking about Jofra bowling 150ks. Does he do that?,5
"**Wicket-keepers to score 70+ runs and affect 3 dismissals in an IPL match**

Adam Gilchrist for DEC v RCB, 2011

Robin Uthappa for KKR v RPS, 2017

**Sanju Samson for RR v CSK, 2020**

**Sanju Samson** became first wicket-keeper to affect stumpings in 2 consecutive balls in IPL. Last year, MS Dhoni took 2 stumpings in 3 balls off Jadeja's bowling vs DC.

*Oddly-specific stat*",17
Dhoni better get out if CSK wants to win the match,3
I am rather interested in watching Dhoni's intent.,9
Dhoni will get to 10(12) in last over and hit 2 sixes of the last 2 balls.,7
"They still have Jadeja, need more wickets",3
Joffra - Travis Scott + Polo G,8

Remember when faf saved that match against aus?,3
Surely archer can bowl a mile or 2 faster if he takes that mammoth of a gold chain off,5
Dug out is sucking so hard to dhoni....,8
Jofra is English Bappi Lahiri,3
"To the people asking how much deeper can take this

Joffra hit 27 runs in 2 balls in the last over. That's 13.5 runs a ball. Extrapolating this, CSK can afford to play another 20 dot balls and take it to the last over",15
Don't show old dhoni highlights please,10
Everyone knows the result of this match but still watching to kill time,16

Why is Bappi Lahiri bowling,9

Dhoni playing some embarrassing shots,8
can dhoni just do a helicopter shot so r/cricket can cream their pants and immediately start loving him,22
"Dhoni in IPL last year - 416 runs

Rayudu + Jadhav - 444 runs",18
It is good thay MSD retired. He has lost the hand eye coordination.,15
Seeing the ghost of a once great finisher,11
well left,8
I dont know what dhoni's doing. Hes not even attempting to score.,9
Dhoni refusing the double for this,7
"Respect to the man, you have to score 80 in 4 overs and you are leaving stuff.",24
"Dhoni : Misses

Crowd: üéâüì¢üì¢üì¢üì¢",28

Dhoni taking the strike to take it even more deep,10
What a leave,6
"It's really so sad to see Dhoni struggle miserably with the bat.

Much as I love Mahi, he's well past his prime.

I'll cherish his last season regardless, thanks for the memories.",13
How is that not a wide?,5
MS Dhoni the old age phoney,1
Too much msd dick sucking that it‚Äôs making me to watch porn.. that will be time better spent. Fuck this shitshow,6

"If Dhoni's not confident of his batting, is he only in the team due to his captaincy?",7

My god this is just painful to watch,4
This attitude of not giving a fuck in a chase is what irritates a hell Outta me,7
"Need 4 runs per ball...

Dhoni 3 runs off 6 balls",7
Dotman,3
Glad to see Dhoni continuing his innings from the WC SF.,6
That 5 th ball is wide,2
Where's Pietersen complaining about intent when Dhoni bats. SMH. Afraid to lose fans in india,3
Sham tak keloge tho...,2
he hasn't played any cricket in over a year. what were folks expecting?,2
Memories of Ind vs Eng 2019 WC intensify. Only if there was Jadhav instead of Faf.,3
"Faf didn't do much wrong. He's playing the Steve Smith role. Smith batted at a similar strike rate at this stage. 

He needed someone to do a Samson at the other end. 

His role in the side as that of an anchor who bats at 130-140 S/R. He's been a very reliable player for CSK all these years and one match shouldn't change that.",6
How hard do commentators suck big players' dicks?,10
Need a Raina special 87(25) here.,10
"Does it suffice to say that Dhoni seems out of touch?  (Dear god don't shit on me).

Having said that, there have been so many misfields in this IPL that it would seem that the majority lack some aspect of match fitness.",4
Aren't we lucky to have commentators who know more about LO bowling than Jof?,6
Archie the blingy boy.,4
Calm down lads he is settling down,3
This gives BatDeep‚Ñ¢ an entire different meaning,6
it's a pity that this stadium hosts only 12 matches out of 56,5
The good thing is that the people who thought dhoni had a vested interest in batting like this against England can shut up...this is just what he does,8
Dhoni vs Unadkat will be interesting. Who will stay true to character,6
F,2
Dhoni masterclass 4\*(7). Take a look people who were shitting on Uthappa and Vijay,8
Honestly RR upped their game and owned CSK today.,8
Dhoni with a SR of 57.14 waiting for Unadkat's over to cash in...,4
Mahendra Singh Redinker,5
Gavaskar is the only one who can tell what is going on in Dhoni's head since he has played this type of innings in international cricket,9
Checked the score on CI and immediately opened hotstar to see dhoni's hilarious end-over struggles. not even kidding!,4
So they've just decided they aren't gonna win this one?,3
Whoever designed RR's kit is absolutely laughing their way to the bank,7
peak dhoni wouldve got a double off that,4
"Just in

Dhoni has smashed 4 of 7

Best finisher for a reason",6
"Unadkat over. If every ball is not hit for a six, it's wasted",5
Maramandi Muttals,2
Star Sports preparing notes for post match show : Top order shit the bed left too much for dhoni to do anything.,11
Ngl watching this Dhoni is worse than our struggle with Dada towards the end of his career,10
Ben Foakes would get these on his own,8
Thala century üòçüòçüòç,1
They need over 20 an over and they are leaving balls. Its out of reach Simon Doull and they know too.,3
CSK‚Äôs last hope Unadkat has arrived. Will need support from Curran as well.,3
"Peak Dhoni would have smashed that for four, older Dhoni straight to the fielder",3
Smith on #hairlinewatch,3
Dhoni‚Äôs favourite bowler,1
I think the commentators are not allowed to criticize senior Indian players... We can't take it deeper otherwise,7
"If they don't get 20 this over, they should drop themselves from the next match",2
Don't think even Andrew Russell can win it from here,10
I don't know if anyone else is old enough to remember Ravi Shastri at the end of his career.. Dhoni reminds me a lot of that time these days..,3
"There is no way Dhoni can pull this off now. 160-170 and CSK will have batted out their overs.

Way to go üôÑ",5
CSK is waiting for the DEW FACTOR,4

Maahi Maar rha ?,0
Faf Faf Faf,5
"The way CsK is batting, it seems Samson was batting on a different pitch",6
Csk need Siraj to win,7
This is just stupid cricket tbh.,2
I m just watching to see how Dhoni leave the ball. Dhoni quit test cricket long time back but test cricket didn't quit him.,4
Dhoni wanted to face Unadkat but Faf wants to grab some free pies for himself.,5
Sam Curran must be so confused about the approach. Get used to it lad. This is how it is. Always has been,6
their last chance to score 30 runs in an over.,1
This over could be big. Started off with a six.,1
12 more like that,1
Faf I never doubted you I promise,4
Ah bless IPL threads. Truely a peak of cricket shitposting,9
Faf maar raha hai. Not Mahi,6
Cmon unadkat entertain us a little,2
"We forgot Unadkat ,shit",2
At this point Dhoni should just step down with honor .,3
"> 79 off 24. Even the on-air commentators are speechless about this approach. 


Cricbuzz commentary lol",9
You know you‚Äôre fucked when you are looking to faf to get like 70 off 20,7
Faf trying hard to make a match of it,6
Oh man faf is going alright,3
Winning is for losers. Rotate strike. Rotate strike. Rotate strike.,3
I'm just glad the Indian team didn't bother giving Dhoni a farewell match. He is not even fit to be selected in a Ranji squad on merit.,2
Exact script of what Jadeja and Dhoni did on that fateful day,9
Does faf play this well for sa?,3
The Dugout commentators already calling a 25 run over when they saw Unadkat on. Lmao,4
"The more he does this, the more the entire nation of Pakistan will further believe he was involved in match-fixing by 'slow batting' in the World Cup game against England to prevent them from progressing to the semi-finals. Ah.",8
"Feel sad for Unadkat tbh, he's become a total meme.",2
At this point Chennai has lost the game. The support staff must have cranked the numbers and it could be better for Chennai to hang around then going all in for a hopeless cause.,3
"Nice rotation. Dhoni. 

It‚Äôs important to rotate the strike in these middle overs.",8
Du plessis us infinitely better than dhoni,1
"CSK still in this!

- the commentators",11
MS looking to make a sporting declaration sometime soon. Declaring while trailing isn't unheard of but is considered risky....,7
Undakut's slower delivery is slower than Ashwin's faster delivery,3
Umesh in the north,3
Fucking commentators too scared of offending a senior player and getting kicked off the commentary team.,8
Faf carrying csks fielding and batting,3
We might finally get Nagarkoti and Mavi bowling tomorrow.,4
Aah the vintage dhoni. Playing for NRR.,9
People talking as if this never happened. CSK always does these,3
How did MI lose to this team? I never know,5

Singles really?,3
Net session/NRR damage limitation session going on,5
"other batsman hitting boundaries while dhoni's SR struggling. hmm, where have I seen this before ü§î",2
Dhoni provided good support so that Faf can play his natural game!,7
"For a guy who is back on the field after 437 days, 6(9) is not too bad eh.",6
I get that csk wants to get net run rate up. But this is painful to watch when there is no competition,3
20+ RRR - takes a single. smh.,5
"Dhoni should‚Äôve actually sent Jadeja, with him and Faf out there, there still would be a chance",2
Beautiful single.,3
At this point I am convinced Dhoni is just doing this for the memes lmao.,7
Fucking hell Dhoni is not even trying. This is so disappointing to see,4
Faf is doing all he can... It's a bridge too far (or is the expression *it is a river too deep*?),2

I hope Dre Russ won't fuck us in these short stadiums tomorrow.,6
"Smart single, get tHe fInIsHeR on strike",5
Dhoni just casually going for singles.,9

"When I was a kid, pokemon tazos or jenga cards came free with a pack of kurkure or equivalent chips brands. Now they're giving out 2GB of free data with a pack of kurkure lmao",12
To think the people on this sub were questioning Faf's place in the team. Its not like we have a ton of options. Yet another year us CSK fans have been bamboozled by their bizarre auction strategy.,17
"Last over : 37 required off 6 balls 

Commentator : Is iT bEyOnD DhOni ???",12
Dhoni has been craving for an test type innings for a long time and at this target no one would even question him.,7
Absolutely disgusting that the top order left sooo much for dhoni to do. Not fair for him. He's on a respectable 4(7),14

Who's gonna open for KKR tomorrow ?,6
Dhoni would've left that,7
dhoni needs only 12 balls..,5
Everytime Unadkat gets hit for a boundary he bowls a slower bowl. A fews games into the tournament he'll be getting smashed for 50 every game,2

This sort of cricket makes me question the integrity of the game sometimes,4
That was the pieiest pie to ever pie,7
Commentators criticised Faf and Jadhav for 2 overs for not showing enough intent. Dhoni does the same shit for 10 balls and no one has said a word. Nice hypocrisy.,21
I am so glad Dhoni is retired from international cricket. He made us lose plenty of matches with this approach.,11
"Faf is just a beast, whoa",2
Faf turned to look at the ball before smashing that,3
"Lol, now it‚Äôs surely possible",1
Tfw CSK lose by the amount of runs scored in the last over by Jofra,8
That was a nice shot ngl,1
Unadkat to win it for Chennai.,3
Lord Unadkat making a game out of it,3
As of 19.29 you should've retired mate.,3
Go gorgeous duplesis,3
Unadkut's bouncer is so slow the batsman has time to get a cup of tea before playing it!,7
Why tf do we still play unadkat,5
UnadCunt it is then. Every single time this guy give us bucket loads of meme. Respect.,2
Always good to see Unadkat's slower balls get the treatment they deserve,7
"Everything changes in 2020... 

Unadkat - Let me bring back some old day memories",5
Faf is going to be MVP for CSK this year.,3
Where's the mofo asking Faf to retire?,8
People who are shitting on csk will still wonder how did they make playoff next month,6
Man du plessis might have given them a chance if we didn't have dead weight at the other end,7
Unadcut and Dhoni staying true to their characters,6
"i say.. still possible
.. i dare say",2
"Theory: The entire CSK camp blocked out the last over from their memories due to the trauma and think the target is 30 runs fewer than it actually is. 

(Screw you faf for making my comment much less funny in the time I took to type it out)",5
"Jesus Christ Unadkat, have some integrity.",4
its the hope man. its the hope that killsüò≠,2
Dhoni should've sent jadeja,2
I really had hopes for Jaydev after his Ranji season but now...,1
At least faf is in form for this season,1
58 off 18 balls is possible.,2
Unadkat is genuinely stealing a living lmao.,5
Faf u mad lad,5
"Unadkat with an economy under 10???

edit: lol",2
"If you think 60 of last 3 is not possible, think 3 times again and think like RCB bowlers.",5
RRR is still 20,2
Wished unad have few more overs,3
20 runs an over? piece of cake,2
Unadkat back at his best after struggling in his first 3 overs.,10
Da Pussy üî•,2
This might be doable. Someone needs to tell Dhoni.,5
Glad to see unadkat didn't dissapoint,3
55* off 29. Fuck you KP!,7
Nice try from Lord Unadkat.,3
RR glad this is a 200+ target.,6
Still not possible?,1
Suck a dick all the Faf haters.,4
Unadkat's reactions after getting hit for 6 are best üòÇ. Dude acts as if he almost bowled the perfect ball but got hit accidentally,11
Lord unadkat to the rescue,1
"Wicket please and FK u unadkat and you too RR management for picking him again, you could have gone for so many other options",3
Is there no other young Indian pacer better than Unadkat RR can find!!,3
Please show some intent Dhoni,8
Wow. Faf just going to do it single handedly then,4
Wow that Vnext and is awful. Those are the worst accents I've ever heard,3
Fuck Faf is still going for it,2
Respect Faf,2
9 sixes needed of 18 balls.,3
Imagine Faf hits all the runs only for CSK to win it with a Last Ball Six‚Ñ¢ by Dhoni.,10
"Faf is out here really trying, I mean Dhoni just needs to hit a couple of boundaries and let Faf do the rest",10
Lmao Unadkat does his usual thing and still they barely get the required rpo,2
Don't do that faf don't give me hope,3
This could have been 40 to get in 3 overs if only Vijay and Dhoni played a bit quicker. Du Plessis giving it his all but we are not winning this.,3
Bhenchod where was this intent ?,2
Faf going broke finally,0
Thala single handedly going to win this for RR. No matter how hard Faf tries,7
"Unadkat being Unadkat . Its just that Dhoni has become so shit lately , otherwise this over would be a turning point .",5
Unadkat - Proud alumnus of the dinda academy üòé,3
"Unadakat does his magic

Now waiting for dhoni's backfoot defence",3
"MS, come on mate, give us a blast from the past for these last three overs.",6
From 17 of 18 to 55 of 29,3
"LORD UNADKAT, LOVE YOU 3000",3
Two overs of Tom Curran. Well at least that's better than one over of unadkat,5
"If I wear that RR jersey in real  life, I'd look like a walking bill board",5
Someone can please tell what in the world is dhoni doing,6
VNEXT market team was with Reah while they came up with the ad,3
Dhoni can't hit shit..,5
"58 of 18 required.

Ajay Jadeja hit 51 off 18 way back in the 96 quarter finals! Anyone remember that?",6
"Dhoni: batting 

r/cricket: üòê",10
Dhoni doesn't care what comm thinks about him? Seriously he's embarrassing us more than Unadkat.,3
Take a single MS.,1
That dope ass Vnext ad,1
"All talk about Dhoni and CSK, no one noticed Undakat is right away back in form after winning Ranji as captain and highest wicket taker.",4
Bet Afiridi Average bowling speed is faster than unadkut,3
Don‚Äôt worry. SRH will make unadkat look like the best bowler when he faces our tail (4-11). We gifted him man of the match last season.,2
58 runs in 3 overs with a well set pair and 2 tom Curran overs is very much on,1
Lord Dinda proud students: Lord Umesh; Lord Unadkat.,2
Vijay and the last over fucked this up for csk,1
Beautiful shot by thala to the fielder üòçüòçüòç,6
"Ffs Dhoni just get out if you can only hit singles.
Jadeja can hit those and run faster",2
Already prepared for the 15-20 runs too many in our last overs talk.,1
Watching faf do this you can't complain that it was too late for MS to do anything. Both could've been hitting to give them a chance.,2
Dheni come on man,2
"See, this is why I am not angry when someone like faf starts slow. I know they can make it up later. Vijay or dhoni on the other hand...",1
Dhoni 7(10). Undakut getting cunted. Nice to have some normalcy in these uncertain times.,8
"Dhoni: Mai tereko strike le k deta kuch kar

Faf obliges with a giggle",7
"Man, Faf is still class, even if he had a slump in form recently. I hope the rumours of him coming back to Lancs once he packs in International cricket are true.",1
Can someone explain to me why the RR management keeps persisting with Unadkat and he goes for runs time and time again? He's a good first class bowler but I dont think t20 is his forte,3
"How many times have I seen Unadkat with ER of 11.


Not 11.01 not 10.99. Exactly 11.",4
"Despite these sixes and what is now a decent strike rate, this is a pathetic inning from Du Plessis. He was 17 off 18 when there the required rate was hovering around 11-13 rpo working the ball around for no reason.",-3
Unadkat is what the Curran‚Äôs would be if they weren‚Äôt try hards,3
"Seriously, fuck Jaydev Unadkat.",4
Faf get a century,3
Sad to see MS playing this way.,4
could only be Dhoni trying to milk Unadkat for singles,4
"Sunil Gavaskar dishing out gems like ""The more runs you score, the better it is for you.""

No shit!",11
"7 (10) with a RRR of 20, just Thala things",6
Woah! Is it gonna get interesting?!,1
RIP NRR,2
Comm: what a magnificent shot from dhoni for single,2
Tom ~~Shelby~~ Curran is scared of sexy towel man,4
This game is not over- Faf says,3
"see dhoni fans, here is where it gets irritating. Required rate is 20 and this guy is going for singles",8
Fafulous!!,3
Permission to change the South African cricket kit to just yellow?,9
Dhoni 7 (10). 4 boundaries can get that to 23 of 14. C'mon MSD.,3
"MS, please consider the greater good of the team, handover the captaincy to Faf and step down. This is hard to watch.",6
Csk- why you always do this?!,4
Can't wait for people to credit Dhoni for discovering Faf's talent and giving him the strike,14
Fucking hell they're gonna get them with an over to spare,5
If CSK fucking win this....,2
Faf be like I'm gonna do this on my own,5
9 more like that,5
"Come on Faf , show them how it's done",1
who is csk's backup wicketkeeper?,1
How deep can one go exactly?,2
Bruh don‚Äôt do this to me. Don‚Äôt give me hope,2
FAF you beaut,1
Faf has been defected,2
"Faf is refusing to give up. On the other hand,",4
Best thing that MS has done till now...,1
Who needs Dhoni when you've got towel man?,2
Goddamn Faf is out here really fuckin trying his best and Dhoni can‚Äôt hit a boundary,5
This is gold üòÇ,2
Lol someone in the thread was claiming that Faf isn't good enough anymore,3
"Faf finally finding rhythm, 7 overs too late",2
"Earlier I predicted Dhoni 6(9).

I knew it would happen.",4
"Dhoni: Let me be your eyes, Faf. Be my arms...",4
Du plessis be like im gonna fuck with the bookies.,3
Far is by far the most handsome man in cricket today,1
"Lol, someone here said Faf was past it just before his first six.",2
"Only if Dhoni supported faf a little more, they could have chased it down",3
Lmao Faf is legit going to win this singlehandedly,2
man duplesis is something else,1
Let's make it interesting Du plessis!!!!!!,1
Dhoni really taking it Deep^TM,3
Only 7 six more to win!!,2
Du plessis rips off the mask. Its thala after all. Checkmate thala haters.,5
Why is Dhoni explaining to Faf? Faf should be the one explaining to Dhoni!,12
"Faf can't do that, can he?",2
Both CSK and RR fans cheering Dhoni on.,2
Faf take my energy („Å•ÔΩ°‚óï‚Äø‚Äø‚óïÔΩ°)„Å•,7
IT'S THE HOPE THAT KILLS YOU :),11
Dhoni thinks it's gettable now,6
There's another Curren brother Ben Currren,3
"Imagine the scenes when Faf does a dhoni by denying dhoni the strike lol. 

Dhoni is a hero who is staying too long to becomes the villian",8
Impostor Faf who batted for his first 18 balls was killed during the strategic timeout and real Faf came in,10
Best man in the field rn faf,4
Chill Faf,1
"Maybe a few years from now, Unadkat will be bought in the auction for peanuts and he'll have his best season... the guys performance is indirectly proportional to his price.",8
There's definitely space for a no ball 6 + free hit 6 in this script right now.,3
Wow Tom Curran. Imagine bowling worse than Unadkat,4
Dhoni teaching Faf to play slower. smh,8
These CSK bastards are bad for my heart.,3
Surely not...,1
"Dhoni telling Faf ""Whatever you do, I should be hitting the winning four""",9
Unadkat the most successful money laundering operation in the history of the world.,12
If only Lungi managed to hold on to his Lungi in the last over,11
Faf is unleashing the kraken!,1
Faf played well against the youngster today he can have the rocky Balboa theme song as he walks away from the field. He deserves it.,2
Dhoni fans gonna be like it was coz of dhoni Faf started hitting,17
If Vijay and Dhoni had tried to hit from early on CSK would still be in this game even if they got out right away.,6
Match saving innings with a SR of ~~196~~ 70.,5
Yes dhoni keep em singles coming,5
Reminds of RCB vs KKR game and Russell finished with one over left,3
"Didn't think it would be this much fun as neutral 

On an unrelated notes does RCB play in this ground?",7
Dhoni - wow Calm down faf!,11
Hahaha the bowler having to wipe down the ball after a big six is the ultimate insult to injury,1
"Fafa first half - balls - 18, runs - 17

Second half - balls 12, runs - 44",4
The home and away concept is basically to help the DJ this time?,1
dhoni hit or get out and let jaddu try,2
Dhoni taking these singles when required run rate near to 20 is painful. I guess he taking game deep & trying to maintain good net run rate.,6
Unadkat proving he is shit in fielding too.....he is like a reverse 3d player,3
Fucking hit a six mahi,3
"Could have been wide , but if sunny says so then I guess it's ok",3
Someone installed magnets on dhenier bat and the ball of opposite poles. This is why he is not able to score. This is a conspiracy against our dhenier. Please react on this so that more people know the truth!!!,15
Shut up sunny. Retire as a commentator too,7
This is like one of those last man standing indoor leagues and Dhonis just out there as a runner,3
"51 of 15, where's Kohli when you need him?",9
"If we take out 29 runs off 26 balls of Dhoni and Jadhav, the target becomes a more gettable 80 off 42 balls.",2
activate dhenier mode!,3
"/u/fad_du_pussy 

Your South African avatar is doing what your username is to Rajasthan Royals... too bad it may be in vain.",2
Run a double you fools,0
Turns out Archer's innings made all the difference in the end.,20
"Atleast Dhoni skirts by as the captain and think tank for CSK. Wondering what exactly is it that Jadhav does gor him to be considered a key cog in the unit. Sub par strike rate for the format, not a power hitter, old - providing stability is a shit excuse",6
2 more sixes cmon lad,1
Fafdup casually with the Orange Cap.,3
What has happened to Dhoni? It's like he has forgotten how to time the ball.,6
"If the Royals win, I think it‚Äôs only fair Smith gets MotM for getting out on 69.",10
"Reason behind sam's cuteness is he is the imposter

Breaking brocode n revealing secrets

Quite like the commentator in action KP",4
Why don‚Äôt the commentators just burrow and live in Dhoni‚Äôs ass.,18
Wtf,1
bruh he cant even hit a four,0
This looks typical csk style hail mary giveth or gone in last three,0
Can't even run FFS.,0
Haha ironically dhoni is the better batsman to bowl to rn in the death overs,6
The Jew is here. Will be difficult to bowl yorkers.,4
Why is Dhoni involved in so many chases where there is lack of intent?,14
"Never change, Dhoni.",2
Dhoni hasn‚Äôt batted in 14 months and needs to hit a specialist for 6,5
The hindi commentary is still finding a way to spin this as Dhoni's amazingness. What a bunch of clowns,18
Dino is roasting Dhoni so hard on the mic XD,5
Dhoni has decided that this IPL he's gonna play as a specialist captain.,10
[deleted],11
[deleted],5
Is it possible to smash a 6 off a yorker?,7
Every time commentator says 'this is an absolutely crucial over' then Dhoni will take a single just to **troll** them,48
Game is officially over now,2
Faf trying to hit the draw shot like he thinks he's Smithy,3
big single by ms,8
"Clever from Faf, leave the tailender just one ball to face at the end of the over",35
Dhoni said something to Faf on camera. Now his genius will be praised for next 25 years if Faf pulls it off.,22
A 30 run over and they are still in the game yes!,2
"if butler joins, does samson still stay behind the stumps? surely they wont drop samson??",2
"Albie morkel anyone?

Jadeja is in dugout also",2
Beyong Nidihas trophy dinesh kartik territory too ( btw Dhoni imitating 3D shankar ),0
The inside part of Dhoni's bat is made of mutual funds....,9
single to keep the strike...,1
Tom Curran is both a skillful bowler & a smart motherfucker.,2
"Young players should get inspired with this innings of Faf and learn from it.
He has shown some class out there.",2
Archers cameo made the difference,8
Looks like a comfortable win for RR unless someone does a Lungi here,3
"Vijay comes, shit on Vijay. Jadhav comes, shit on Jadhav. Faf comes,shit on him too. Never change r/cricket",1
Need four runs a ball,2
If piyush chawla bowls the last 2 overs csk can win ..,1
"We're not very far behind were RR were at this stage. That last Ngidi over is where we really lost, not the batting. Score is on par for this pitch",1
Where is quick running between wickets?,1
That ngidi over really did fuck everything up eh,2
Can someone tell Dhoni they're actually supposed to try and win atleast?,2
"8 of 11!
Even Bumrah will somehow score boundaries during these situations.",2
"This just Dhoni taking it deep guys. I‚Äôm sure something will happen at like the penultimate or last ball. You know, gotta give something to fans. Last ball six? Yeah that‚Äôs gotta feel good, forget about the match.",6
This is the Dhoni we all know keeping that red inker,2
"Dhoni has absolutely lost his sense of urgency, completely out of sync since 2017",1
Faf thinking... STFU Dhoni.,2
"Whistle this, podu that 


Ffs thala hit a boundary",7
Dhoni is too good. He knows exactly where the fielders are so he can hit there.,13
24 from both overs.....does csk have a russel??,4
#####Dhoni is the imposter,8
"Once Buttler is back, he is probably replacing Miller? The death bowling looks sharp with Curran and Archer.",3
6 sixes faf?,1
Change of bat for Dhoni?,3
even a 36 run over  wouldn't make it easy for us ftw,1
Dehnier bat change ^TM,4
I would say Steve Smith was the best batsman today. Surely not good conditions to bat especially good length deliveries. He played it all so well today,-1
Jadeja should have come up instead of Dhenier,3
Dhoni gotta score more atleast to get the naysayers off his back ... forget about winning the match,2
Is Dhoni gonna go all blazing?,1
"Dhoni fans, if you really support this tuk tuk

you're as retard as the guy on the field",3
[deleted],1
Dhoni with a masterly supporting role in a losing cause.,3
can we please stop with the fucking hate already. he's faced only 10 balls and its never as easy as it looks. all you mofos sitting at home and yapping away put some respect on my mans name lol,4
Dhoni called for his ‚Äúgetting out‚Äù bat,4
Dhoni last 2 balls six coming up.,4
"437 days later, same old Dhoni returns",5
Should be Dhoni's last season,2
I remember a similar sort of situation CSK was under with two overs remaining....and then Kohli decided to bowl himself.,5
We just need someone to be a Ngidi.,1
"dhoni really needs to be a ""pal do pal"" ka mehmaan while batting if csk want to qualify 


Translation:needs to get out ASAP",1
Dhoni is such a good hitter of singles.,1
"Hey american here, found this thread on r/popular, I just have one question, I was told Dhoni is the best finisher (is he and MS the same guy?), what is he doing here?",7
I swear to fucking god if dhoni hits two sixes in final over when we have already lost the game...,2
we need to emulate their last over,1
"At this rate, looks like the difference is going to be Archer's cameo",1
"I wonder what his teammates think of him in these circumstances. You can't be starstruck all the time. 

You have to be like ""The Fuck You Doin Mate"" sometime...",6
"We know RR and CSK was involved in fixing. The way Dhoni is playing, I wonder if all those matches with INTENT, are directly proportional with that.",2
tom curran is built,2
24 off the next two overs. That should be easy for 'cool as a cucumber finisher' Dhoni.,2
Do you ever wonder if Dhoni even likes cricket,2
"Needed kohli

But Archer bowling the 19th over",2
Jadhav and Dhoni innings this match seems so bad.,1
Who's the most realistic captain of CSK post Dhoni?,3
"Last year, KKR needed 53 off 16 balls against RCB and they won with 5 balls to spare. Then there was the time in 2014 when RR needed 62 off 22 balls and then won with 7 balls to spare.

You never know what's gonna happen.",5
Faf is hitting each and every ball out of the park..,1
Will be a pretty sight to see CSK fans turn on Dhoni after a few games.,3
Someone needs to do a Joffra to Joffra.,3
Guys calm the fuck down. Thala's got this. Trust him,-9
"Dhoni might as well just coach csk if he just wants to give them tips
.",7
Thala fans - see how SR of faf shot up just by the presence of thala,5
Just have to hit Archer for 30 üôÇ,4
Even Faf is shocked at how he is smashing,4
Murali Vijay playing slowly at the top is the last thing you want when you are chasing 217,1
The lockdown must have been hard for Bollywood. Never have I seen so many mainstream actors in ads!,7
Never watching ipl again if we bottle this.,5
"joffra, its only fair...

just 2 no balls and 1 wide in case you forgot...",6
At this rate Faf may not be available for the next couple of matches because of carrying the entire fucking weight of CSK!,11
That worm though....,1
Incoming Dhoni 21(16),6
Whenever Dhoni comes on to bat it's not just the expectations that rise but even required run rate will go up.,12
Anyone remember India vs England at last year's World Cup?,11
Wtf is dhoni doing?,6
MS cant be relied to even save NRR these days.,3
This is a good knock from Faf,3
[deleted],11
Are woh Faf akela hi batting kar raha hai. Faf is waging a lone war.,3
That CSK worm needs to have a massive boner to win from here.,3
Helicopter crash coming up.,3
Missed the trick by not sending Jadeja & not exposing himself,3
Bahinchod ek do hi banao,5
I think the Pakistanis can stop blaming us for playing slow on purpose to get them out of WC.,8
"When you look at it, maybe CSK had better chances sending jaddu in before.",5
Bro Ngidi what did you do,8
Ngl Dhoni's innings is hilarious,7
imagine if dhoni was on 25 off 11...instead of fucking 8!!,6
Chakka mardo bahinchod,3
dhoni please hit something,4
Dhoni out incoming folks,4
"man im so confused, pls cricketing gods do something",2
Du Plessis protecting the tail (Dhoni) from strike.,13
45 on 10 balls aji loda mera,7
Damn it dhoni,1
I will take this over 90 all-out,4
Lack of intent and Dhoni is at crease,3
Jeez Dhoni is painful to watch.,7
Dhoni is surely done now,5
Ms is batting like he doesn't give a fuck.,3
Incoming painful dhoni misses,4
Sorry but 9 from 12 in this situation is such garbage,4
Dhenier is placing it to perfection.,3
If it wasn't for Archer's big dick pounding in the last over...we could have,3
What would Gambhir do if he was in this position?,2
"Really hope in Post match interview Dhoni gets asked "" WTF was that ?""",6
Now they need boundaries on every ball.,2
idk man it's just sad seeing Dhoni playing like this,8
"Look MS, at least get out. Jadeja is in my fantasy team and I could milk more points out of him.",6
F#cking 8\*(11) when faf is playing out of the world innings,3
"Virgin other teams : try to chase 217

Chad CSK : forget about the total and just score 190 without trying",9
Archer's 4 sixes the difference at last,5
Dhoni does not give a fuck,4
TUK TUK MODE activated,4
Dhoni to join Pujara academy.,7
"Thala is challenging FAF by scoring those 9 runs of 12

If he started hitting, FAF would have become complacent.  That't the genius of that man!!! Different ways of motivating people.",11
Dhoni just doesn't have the power. Seems so frustrating watching.,14
Maximum respect to faf,8
TBH Faf shouldn't even be taking single with dhoni at the other end,5
Finally,2
"Yeah CSK has lost now guys, I think this is the ideal time for Dhoni to start hitting",3
Archer would have a great career as a rapper,0
Dhoni is washed.,3
 Imagine Jadeja's 24 of 12 instead of dhonis's 9 along with faf's innings.,7
Faf is doing it effortlessly,1
still possible,2
Will dhoni also mention quantum of loss like his fans are.,4
"Every time he bowls a slower ball, he gets hit for a six. And yet he never learns!",2
I'll eat the dead skin off my toe if CSK manages to win this one.,3
"Fuck me, Faf has absolutely nailed every single short ball in the past half hour",9
Instagram fan pages thinking of an explanation rn,13
Dhoni expecting last over like lungi,5
I going to rub it out to that picture of Faf in a towel tonight,4
du plesis for orange cap.,5
MS. Clutch.,3
"8 x 6 = 48

simple math",6
9 off 12!!! How many balls do you think we have left MS??,4
Peak dhoni would be ashamed of that 9(12),6
Nice,1
Jofra did it again,3
Archer babay,2
good effort from faf but the team didn‚Äôt share ir,1
Great response from gun jof,1
"Faf trying his best.
Dhoni trying his best for RR.",9
F,1
Sanju is everywhere today,3
Dhoni will have an average of infinity after remaining not out in both thee matches,7
I'd say take Dhoni in the test team. Not even kidding,6
Scott Styris needs to take it out of his mouth for a moment here.,6
Haha it's over now,5
Just been so happy to see Faf bat so well in his two matches. Anchor role and now teeing off.,12
Thats the game.,7
"Dhoni never retired from test cricket, just carried it over to IPL",15
Lone wolf innings from Faf,8
Say whatever.. hell of an innings by Faf.. atleast he tried.. Dhoni couldn't even hit a single boundary.,9
"Morkel was from SA, du plessis is from SA",3
[deleted],6
"Imagine CSK pulls this off at this point , na scratch that Faf is gone",1
Well played Faf la,1
The 1% chance they had of winning this is gone as wel GG Archer and Dhoni.,1
Quickfire 9 off just 12 balls for Dhoni yes,2
Thala taking it deep,2
Aww,1
Too deep ?,2
Bye guys,2
Admirable effort by Faf! Made for a fun watch.,4
"Dhoni frm bits n pieces in wc last year

Has gone down to shits n pisses this year",4
The innings this chase deserved. Faf did his job.,2
Dhoni= main 0 fucks de sakta hun,0
"Du plesis, Fucking great innings man. You can't win the match alone.",2
Dhoni taking this to the end,2
Good night lads.,2
"Thank you Faf, thank you Thala.",3
Great innings faf you tried. Thank you!,5
"Faf carried them, great knock",5
"Thought that looked quick, surprised it was 129kph. Batted Faf",2
Dhoni gonna hit 6 sixes to close the match. /s,3
"Well done duplesi, you tried that what's matter's the most",7
well played faf. fucking take over the captaincy,2
72 of 36 after being 17 of 18 is insane!,7
Dhoni is getting paid 15 crores lol atleast try to hit a boundary.,3
Not a bad strategy to bowl a shitty ball so it gets hit for a six and you get a new ball that isn't affected by dew.,1
Jof you beauty,2
"Pleaseee star sports stop jerking off Dhoni now

Thats all I want",4
Fucking didn't even crossed the strike,2
"Glad Archer got a wicket in the end, strong performance from him today with bat and ball",5
More than 4 a ball and MSD plays pull short for a single. Faf hits a monster six to a same delivery next. All Dhoni fans despair.,9
"Lmao nobody gives two fucks about R/cricket,dhoni is the GOAT facts no wicket keeper has achieved what he has, Dhobi..nobody gives a fuc about R/cricket is nickname is THE KING OF STUMPING along with THE GOAT go to sleep bitches dhoni's achievment will dwarf any other wicket keeper,and soon he will be the wicker keeper with most ipl titles,love the hate on reddit go to sleep haters",-11
Dhoni waiting for Piyush to finish what he started.,5
Great knock from DuPlesis though. The only one who put his head down and tried,4
Imagine this Dhoni in the next T20I World Cup.,4
This would have been a legitimate game if that Ngidi over never happened. Smh,3
Dhoni playing for his coveted IPL average?,3
Dhoni is past it. He has been past it for the last 3 years. I'm a big fan but he should have retired from intl cricket right after 2017 Champions Trophy. Pant should have been groomed for the finisher role,6
Respect where it‚Äôs due. Phenomenal innings faf,7
"Cmon guys... I don't  care about CSK or RR... just want a heart pounding-ly close game!  *Dhoni uncle, kuch karo* (T: Uncle Dhoni, do something)",1
dhoni needs to retire he looks like he‚Äôs gonna pass out,5
"Fantastic innings from du Plessis. Tbh, batting was good, our bowling department fucked up today.",2
MSD taking it deep. Will remain not out*,4
It's good to know CSK can fuck up like the rest of us.,3
gg faf. You did well. Just needed someone not playing 9(12) on the other end,9
Take a bow Faf du plessis. The man did all he could have possibly done.,3
One heck of a bouncer from Archer,3
Lungi last over screwed shit up.,6
This game is perfect for CSK-hating-Faf-simps like myself,4
"Faf looking frustrated by dhoni now, he isn't even waiting to talk to him now",6
Faf doesn‚Äôt deserve this,9
Feel bad for Faf. Outstanding innings by him. The rest of the team let him down,5
Faf beats Dhoni in the bicep game as well,5
So now we need yuvi for the 6 sixes in the final over right?,2
There was one guy who predicted dhoni coming in at over 16 and playing a real slow inning wayyy early in the match. Whoever it was you have my respect,13
"hope sharjah doesnt ruin the ipl...

i cant stand it if we only reach semis...",0
"Now Unadkat will be like give me the ball, I'll finish the game.",1
GG FAF take a bow,9
"Well done MS, you've taken it deep.",9
Gotta love a classic Dhoni net session,3
Faf casually averaging 130 this IPL.,4
Damn what an innings regardless of the outcome,6
"Dhoni fans I have a question for ya "" hahahaha ? Hahahah? HahahüòÇüò≠",6
This is so sad Alexa play mai pal do pal ka shaayar hu,3
"Bowl yourself Smudge, you‚Äôre defending 38!",5
This innings has so much similarity with my assignment,5
"**18.5** Archer to du Plessis, OUT,  **179-6**

F du Plessis c &dagger;Samson b Archer 72 (37b 1x4 7x6) SR: 194.59",4
"well played faf, true warrior! respect",4
My guy Faf played with a strike rate of 200 and these commentators are still sucking off Dhoni.,16
"Honestly can't expect Faf to carry it by himself, Dhoni needs to contribute!",6
Just realized except for archer (lol) none of the England boys have been laid in months,4
What is wrong with Jaddu. He should have come after Sam Curran. Its looking painful to watch Dhoni bat. He is not match fit at all. I think he should bat up at 3 to avoid these situations.,5
38 off 7. This is still in Thala's zone.,12
CSK not playing to win clearly. To decrease the margin of defeat for NRR. Same thing Dhoni did in world cup match vs England.,5
"Samson 74(32)

Faf 72(37)",5
Great Leave from Jadeja,5
"All is good over here but who we trolling tomorrow, it's the stalwarts clashing, ain't it?",0
The difference between the two teams is that last over from Ngidi.,5
"Jadeja and dhoni in the death overs?

WC flashbacks",9
Kab khaulega re Dhaniya tera khoon?,5
Nice leave Jaddu,2
You HAD to hit that ball genius,2
Hindi comms update: they just called Jofra the boy from karate kid,6
Nooooooo,1
Jadeja betichod test cricket nahi hai yeh.,2
"72 (37) but got no support, so it does nothing other than minimize NRR hit.",11
Ya. Well left jaddu.. u learned from the captain after all..,2
Good game faf. Fuck you dhoni,8
Wtf was that leave by Jadeja?,2
Now Dhoni is going to get a couple of boundaries in the last over.,2
Did he just leave the ball,3
It's not just lack of intent he just cant hit it anymore. Difficult to see dhoni like that.,4
IND vs ENG WC game flashbacks,3
"Did he leave it!!

üòÇüòÇüòÇ",5
Sir with that leave with rrr of 38,8
Beautiful leave,5
"Lmao, Jaddu leaving a ball when they need 38 off 7.",5
"Dhoni 8(12). Even if he had blindly slogged and managed 25(12), they would be needing 20 off 8 balls right now. 

But his fans gonna make it seem like the game was lost by the time he came in.",11
Eventually CSK will go so deep they'll start borrowing overs from the next match,6
"Still don't believe Dhoni is finished, then u are dumb",3
Cocksucking Intent talk nah,5
"A difficult task for Jadeja now, made impossible by a slow Dhoni. Flashbacks of World Cup Semi Final.

There are some things that even pandemics cannot change.",3
hey! not ready...,2
"Faf really showed some intent, he played a great innings",3
HAHAHAHA...didn't even offer a shot!,1
38 of 6. Yea nows the time Dhoni,6
Damn I just hope no no balls.,2
[deleted],4
If ngidi was playing for RR we would still have a chance,2
"Thala takes it to the last over again

True mastermind",3
No way Jaddu left it when you need 38 off 7 lmaooo,7
I‚Äôm severely disappointed Faf didn‚Äôt get out 3 runs earlier. Not nice.,0
Good leave!,4
"Jadeja hasn't done anything for India in these situations, ghanta CSK ke liye kuch karega.",4
Dhoni to hit 6 sixes and lose the match by 1 run.,6
Jadeja with a well judged leave,4
"On the plus side for SA/CSK, FaF is in sublime form.",2
Jadejas like I know where my off stump is ..I m a proper test batsman,4
I hope MSD doesn't get out today. Only 6 balls to survive.,5
GG FAF,1
"LOL Jadeja leaving and almost saying ""are you allowed to bowl so well?""",5
"Jofra: consistently about the best bowler in almost every white ball game he plays in.

Commentators: wHy dOeSnT hE jUsT bOwL fAsT?!",6
Dhoni probably has a FTW tattoo on his arm .,3
~~Vintage~~ Dhoni,6
"Yeah that wicket is on Dhoni

Dude can't be making 9 (12) when you're chasing 215",8
"Dhoni. Jadhav.

This is the stupidest taking it deep ever.",3
"I still remember Ramiz Raja telling, ""agar ek do no ball ho jaye, aur chakke pad jaye, to mumkin hai""",2
Nicely play out these 6 balls for a draw.,2
"If only he'd have come in earlier üòµ, they would have won with overs to spare.",2
"Dhoni will hearts in last over with a not out score  
Finishing the game",3
"If there was any other batsman other than Dhoni, things would've been different. None of the commentator has the guts to call out Dhoni is done and dusted. In one match during this season, probably SRH, he'll cunt the bowlers and people will praise him. Thank god he retired from international cricket.",4
"‚ÄúThis is actually a 400 IQ play from Thala to give a false hope to RR so they won‚Äôt play Buttler or Stokes. What a genius, what a legend, this is why he‚Äôs the best.‚Äù - Instagram fan pages in the next few hours.",6
We are using up  Faf's  quota of performance for the season too early in the season. We get like 4 from Faf and Watto. Two or 3 from Dhoni at max and then a couple here and there from the rest of the squad,5
"Lmao, Jaddu being too cute.",3
can dhoni just hit something for shits and giggles instead of being a wimp ass bitch,3
Dhoni losing his big-hitting ability is actually not that surprising but not one of these 'experts' willing to acknowledge it and still hyping him up does get quite annoying,12
Well left. I never thought I would say this in a t20 match when asking rate is over 30,9
Lowkey jadeja complaining about height,6
Only if lord Dhoni hit a couple of boundaries it could‚Äôve been done,4
"Dhoni will now aim to reduce Quantum of Loss^TM

^TM All rights reserved by trademark by Rhiti Sports Management",3
Well done Faf brave warrior,5
What are you guys talking about? So obvious Dhoni batted slowly to prevent Pakistan‚Äôs chances of reaching the semi-final.,15
Dhoni needs to drop himself like Gambhir did or he'll just tarnish his image this season.,12
"If you still defending Dhoni , than i guess you may just be retarded",7
Now Dhoni will hit 6 sixes in the next over and CSK will lose by one run,3
[deleted],3
"Dhoni 3 sixes last over to up the strike rate and make game seem close get CSK to 200, job done",3
Dhoni did not even try to cross over while that catch was being taken.,3
"I wonder if RR guys talk among each other like "" Dhoni ko out mat karna """,4
Dhoni playing for NRR from now only haha,2
Now Thala doesn't run even?,2
Wait for thala magic üôà,2
Just need someone to bowl like ngidi last over,1
Dhoni will unleash his inner Srini mama this over,1
Thala is past it.,1
So we know they gonna blame Lungi for this loss,2
38 from 1 over? Yeah no problem. EZ,2
Wondering if I'm failing at life because I have no intent,1
Dhoni hasn't hit a single boundary till now.,2
No boundaries yet for dhoni in this ipl üò®,2
"Thala to hit 6 sixes and lose by 1 run, as is customary",6
"Dhoni with the task of 38 off 6.

Cricbuzz trolling",2
finito,1
quick single from MS!,3
Can't wait to see some west indian sloggers on this pitch,3
"Dhoni will smack a couple of boundaries, get a positive strike rate, and wonder off thinking why the rest of his team isn't doing their job properly.",3
Absolute scenes when top memester Dhoni finishes with a SR < 100,7
Might be dhoni doesn't want to get hurt at start of season by Archer. Mind you guy is already 40 yrs old,2
Good leave rav,2
"inb4 the ‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt support him at his worst, you don‚Äôt deserve him at his best‚Äù and ‚ÄúWin, lose, or die, Dhoni till I die‚Äù posts on Facebook.",9
Now he looks for a 2nd run LOL,2
Motherfuck.,1
"Dhoni such a great finisher, he hits it straight to the fielders everytime.",4
Jaddu thinking it was a *trial ball*,6
"When dhoni dots. He is building an innings...
But when jadeja dots. How dare he",5
Well left Jaddu. Making a case for Test middle order,5
"Dhoni went the same way every other Indian legend went. 

I did so much for the country, I deserve that place",8
"Faf is one of the most absolute clutch players, I know Dhoni is supposedly the cool and calm guy but Faf is so composed when he's batting, uses his cricketing brain so well when playing. Definitely one of the underrated GOAT's",11
"CSK: "" All our foreign slots are full""
Fuck you replace Shane watson for someone like malan can't wait till finals to get Shane started.",3
Imagine this team with Stokes and Buttler. üî•üî•,7
"Jadeja: Ayega?
Dhoni: Nai bhai aaj ka ho gaya",6
we need bravo back.,1
Commentators now defending dhoni's intent hahaha. Ass licking at its best,1
lmao why the fuck would you leave a ball when the equation is 38 of 7,4
This is how deep you take it. Need 38 off 6.,3
Ah yes MS (strike switcher) dhoni,3
Did Jaddu just mock Dhoni? Lol.,5
To think the two teams are only 6 runs apart at this point,4
Someone needs to tell Dhoni taking it deep doesn't work when you have more than 36 runs to get in the last over,3
I want someone who defend me like hindi commentators do when dhoni take rr to 20,6
Time for Dhoni to show intent and take his SR to 130+ by hitting 2 sixes,7
sad to watch dhoni like this.,5
The insides of Dhoni's bat are made of ..._cotton_,3
The way some of the CSK batsmen have batted tho. Shameless. No other word for it.,2
Proper banter from Jadeja to leave a ball,4
Nb6 +nb6+ Wd4 coming up,2
Had they sent Jadeja instead of Dhoni...they could have been in a better position now,2
"Let's just pretend to take a second run, and not actually take it.",2
Jaddu tryna maintain that average with a not out innings,6
"37 off 5. Come on CSK, you got this.",3
"hahaha, bat change when RRR = 38",2
"Change bats bro, that will win the game",5
The six hitting bat is out now,3
Csk fans be like Dhoni can still do it,2
Quality singles right there,1
Swapping bats when you need 36 off 4 lmao,3
Heroic innings by Dhoni for RR,1
comeon MS make it easy for your fans get a boundary,1
Bat change lmao. He is taking the piss here.,1
Jatin sapru has already called Dhoni Master finisher more time than no. Of balls he will face this season,2
"Ah yes, the famous penultimate or last ball six.",2
[deleted],1
Lol what's the use of all this bat changing now,5
Jadeja showing why his batting is as good as useless in this format at the slot he bats in.,2
HALLA BOL ROYALS ‚ô•Ô∏è GG !,2
The 'sir hum soch rahe hain ki hum kar Kya rahe hain' look on his face lol,2
Basically they want to finish 30 runs short and troll Ngidi.,3
Dhoni changes bats to finally hit a six,1
"Oh, the bat was the problem!",0
Dhoni boundary would be good for his confidence,1
Pretty sure Dhoni‚Äôs gonna start hitting now to get his sr up and his fans gonna say it‚Äôs not his fault,8
Yeah MS. Let's hit out when all is lost. Shame it took u this long to come up with it,5
Test comeback on the cards for dhoni,0
Nevermind. Just want to see if the person who interviews dhoni asks him about that innings?,4
Told you,0
yes changing the bat will help in getting 36 off 4 balls,0
"Haan BC, that bat was holding you back...",2
Dhoni batting nowadays feels like getting into the nets after awhile with your mate's slightly heavier bat and sluggishly splicing it in the follow through,3
Big six but too late,3
9 runs a ball. Only lungi can do this.,4
"the problem was with the bat all along, guys...",10
"Samson 74(32)

Faf 72(37)

He almost  equalled it lol",3
statpad‚Ñ¢,4
Not to be snarky but when was the last time Dhoni turned the game on its head with his batting?,7
yay they‚Äôre bringing the slog bats out when the required rr is 48!,4
Archer MOTM imo bowled well and his cameo but they'll give it to Samson,3
The Dhoni special,5
Thala power,2
"If we hit 9 every ball, we can still win this.",7
So Faf has 2x50s in 2 games so far?,3
That's some serious trolling by MS,9
Too late buddy,3
Yeah now improve your strike rate and average MS,6
"Where are you now, haters",7
"Fuck yeah bats changed, now come at us.",5
Roflmao fuck off,4
Typical.. tuk tuk match lost.. let me hit a six now..lol,1
So a last ball 6 to save the face?,1
Thala is back!!!,1
"A difficult task for Jadeja now, made impossible by a slow Dhoni. Flashbacks of World Cup Semi Final.

There are some things that even pandemics cannot change.",2
"Dhoni apni average bana gaya, lol.",1
Now he is finally gonna hit to save his strike rate.,4
"Ok Dhoni fan got something to defend him, lmao",5
Been a dhoni fan for the longest time and this is just outrageous,4
In tha slot,1
"A bat change now when the game is lost, way a compete idiot",1
"Curran shld bowl offspin now just for the heck of it. What are they gonna do, hit him?",1
My god dhoni has put a bloob on his legacy. Big fan of his but he's become his own biggest enemy,3
"Haramkhor!!

What was he doing for last 12 balls?",5
Classic Dhoni boundary for his 100+ strike rate,6
"dhoni came, but a little late",2
lol,1
why you no do this 3 overs back,7
Dhoni. Finally. Quantum of loss.,3
Sam sitting in no sitting area lol,2
All it needed was a bat change,2
"OMG! DHONI IS ACTUALLY CHANGING BATS..... NOW! NOW!

At this point, he is just mocking the supporters!",6
Yaayyyy six,1
why wasn‚Äôt he doing this before,2
"Watching Dhoni has become so annoying, as if he's better than the game itself. But I know he's so experienced, so he knows what he's doing. But it's just not enjoyable.",6
"Lol, like I said.",1
time for stat padding dhoni,2
"That‚Äôs it haters, Dhoni did it. He salvaged the game. Now I CAN SLEEP BETTER",5
Wow he finally brought out the bat with spring in it,1
Last over six^^TM,7
Why are the commentators not being neutral here. Why are they not appreciating RR? Where is that spirit?,2
"How do you know for sure when a game is lost?

Dhoni hits a six.",13
bhenchod,2
Somebody called a bat change earlier and then sixes.,2
ahh new bats for the strike-rate sixes. shameless!,2
Why change bat you scoring 9 runs off a ball or wot,2
Why even bother?,1
How the fuck is every ball straight to the fielders hands,1
"battle sam v tom 

the guy who played good end up losing",3
Oh shut up dino. Shut the fuck up. That's ridiculous. The reason is he isn't timing it.,1
r/cricket talk nah!,3
Stat padding time boysss need that not out,4
Now the sixes come out. Typical.,2
Dhoni starts hitting now the match is impossible. He had literally only had singles and dots up to this point. That is shocking,4
Why do these hindi commentators suck so much?,4
Ekhad six maar hi deta hu,1
Dhoni please fuck off and retire already,-1
THALAAAAAAA,0
At last one six..too late,3
Surprising how these commentators' voice is clear when they are so far up Dhoni's ass,5
How does this auger well for matches to come. This is garbage time hitting. Means nothing.,1
Thala for a reason <3,1
This is just fan service lmao,7
Thala fanbois creaming their pants .,11
"Even after tewatia 3 wickets, I don't think we could have won if we didn't have archer.",2
Who didn‚Äôt predict this lol,3
Pehle Bat badal leta Bhai.,2
Dhoni stat padding now my man is beyond shameless,3
Whats the point of hitting a Six when everything is lost?,1
"Cricinfo trolling

Archer to Jadeja, no run
And he shows he has learnt from his master. A leave to end the 19th over. Dropping his wrists out of the way like proper Test match cricket",3
There will be another boundary and the SR will end up looking decent.,2
"Now that the match is out of hand, it's FLEX time.",2
Panbahar pan masala pointless six of the innings award goes to!,5
I mean NRR right guys?,4
Dhoni gets people hyped with a video of a six in the nets then drops these performances. I still love him though.,4
Mother of Stat padding.,3
[deleted],0
Dhoni now saving his strike rate,4
Does Tom Curran know you don't have to be cunted every over?,4
"4d chess to improve strikerate, average, net run rate",4
I feel that Jofra takes IPL as an opportunity for experiment. He bowls way way better for England.,4
"It's quantum, lads",3
Jadeja's beautiful leave will be the difference hahahaha,3
Yep. Game already lost so now it's time for Dhoni to increase his SR.,7
Classic Dhoni,8
Change bats and hits sixwhen the required run rate is over 36.00 ü§°,8
Thank you frontline heroes for six,5
Now they're gonna praise that one six rest of the wholw night while casually ignoring faf innings,6
Somehow this six by MSD is even more annoying,6
Classic misbah... Oh wait!,4
Textbook stat padding from Dhoni,7
[deleted],5
Dhoni the finisher. lol,4
"Haha, Thala doing Thala things!",3
Imagine waiting till 36 needed off 4 to do this,11
Now dhoni hits a few boundaries and makes his sr look decent after killing the chase. Sad to see that even his ipl form is gone and now he's in dino mode.,5
Where was that bat before ?,3
Dhoni managing to get his fans happy so that they'd defend his non existent finishing,8
This has to be a joke now,4
Now dhoni is just messing,5
This is vintage dhoni - take it deep till the games gone then start smashing it,11
A couple of such hits a little earlier would have helped.,7
Where the fuck was this intent 10 balls ago,13
Dhoni just want to reduce the quantum of loss^tm guys. Chill down,7
"This looks worse, why couldn't you do this when the match was still in the balance.",5
MiSbah Dhoni... hitting sixes when the game is already over.,10
Haters have gone quiet now ü§´,2
That cunt just nicked the ball,3
I hope he doesn't bowl no ball.,2
What a shot !!!,1
This is top trolling,8
Dhoni should've changed his bat before coming in to bat.,3
Never seen curran get twacked this much,1

So fucking infuriating - doesn't hit until the game's gone",10

Dhoni is targetting for that run rate for a long time this is a inconsequential match lost at first few overs itself I can understand it. Dhoni is not his old self but he is better than many to make into most ipl teams main playing team.,3

Either MS is a troll supreme or there was some money riding?,10
That is one of the most convincing 16 run wins I have ever seen in T20 lol. There have been 40 run wins which have been less convincing and less dominant.,7
Wait so people are hating Dhoni for hitting 6s and earlier they were hating him for not hitting 6s?,11
HAHAHA SCREW YOU HATERS LMAO 29 of 17 now complain,-11
Pathetic. He is playing for his average and not for the team. You can say NRR as much as you like but look at the score. If they went for it 3 overs earlier it could have been very close,17
Quantum of loss minimized. 4d chess move will pay off when we finish joint at 12 points with KXIP and RCB and go through on NRR.,5
That might be one of the most selfish innings I've ever seen. Made a difficult chase impossible before proceeding to do a bit of stat padding to finish. Not what you want from a team player let alone a captain,24

"Ok. So I don't understand one thing here..Dhoni shouldn't hit 6's if the game is already gone ? What do you expect him to do then ? 

He should have showed some intent earlier, no doubt about that but calling him a stat padder for hitting 6's at the end is not logical.

Alright boys since I couldn't win it for you before am i gonna do a Maxwell leave and keep my honor.",9
Why is no one talking bout sanju samson lol!!,6
Ngl that six from Dhoni to send the ball to the street outside was a sight to see,40
Sunny G giving it to MS. Good.,15
Ayy KP is fuming. Only he has the balls to call the BS.,29
Ok Kevin Pietersen is really taking chances with his criticism of Batdeep,18

I can sense the return of the legend lord thakur in the team boiiis,22
Stats never reveal the complete story .,15
the umpiring and commentary has been shit tier so far in this season.,15
Wow Sanju Samson looks absolutely thrilled,9
The practice jersey for RR is better than the abomination they wear on the field,21
"In all the talk of Dhoni not hitting out before the last over, also remember he sent youngsters before him in such a difficult game when he could have been out there playing the most balls",16
Sanju looks like he didn't select himself in his dream11,25
"Hard to pick a particular moment; for me, though, Samson's catch to take Faf.

Anyway, the right team won, and I'm super chuffed with my somewhat arbitrary choice. If the Royals don't win, that would be a shame. Just so long as it is not MI!

Only four matches in and I am developing prejudices üëç",14
Okay i am done with the Dhoni bashing. I actually need him to play and get exposed more lol.,5
What does power player of the match even mean? Surely Archer and Samson had a better game than Watson?,8
Video request: Highlights of Faf's innings with Linkin Park's In the end playing in the background,13
FYI Mayanti and LORD Binny had a child recently... So she's not part of Ipl,13
Question: why doesn't Samson play for Indian limited over format?,5
"MS Dhoni on why didn't come early to bat

> I haven't batted for a very long time, and the 14-day quarantine hasn't really helped.",18
There are worse ways to lose. RR played well and this was an entertaining game. CSK is probably better off for this loss.,7
"Can we stop hating on Dhoni? Yes it was annoying to watch his innings, but it's becoming a bit too excessive.",15
Dhoni is probably the only captain in the history of this game to be defended even after his team loses with his fault.,28
"Fucking cricbuzz writing paragraphs abt why CSK lost, and not a single mention that RR just batted well.",35
Unpopular opinion but I prefer this presenter (Aussie lady) over Mayanti,17
"When life gives you Sanju, make it Samson and not Manju",47
Anyone else feel they should allow 5 foreigners instead of the current 4?,1
Why is the crowd noise still on in post match presentation.,20
"RR vs RCB will be amazing.

Mi and Csk can fuck off.",-12
"Csk lost cuz of Ngidi and Rajma Chawla, das pretty much it",11
"RR were sick today. Do we see more from Samson or is he just gonna hit in match 1 and not again, like usual",13
The commentators should call him Sanju Samsung and collect the sweet ad placement money like Ceat Tyres Strategic timeout,10
Suspect Vijay's in the team for Srini mama's quota. I would rather have Lord Thakur in the team in place of Vijay. At least I remember him winning a match late in order with the bat a season or two ago with Faf.,17

Love Sanju's proper South Indian accent. Always a joy to hear that!,14
">Released by Kolkata Knight Riders ahead of the auction, Chawla became the most expensive capped Indian player with three-time IPL champion CSK paying Rs 6.75 crore for the leg-spinner. Chawla had set his base price at Rs 1 crore and it was CSK that fought off a bidding war with Kings XI Punjab to secure the bowler who has the fourth-most wickets in IPL cricket.


Ahahahahahahaha",12
"What the actual fuck of a question was that from Murali Karthik, this guy is such a weirdo",1
16 crore worth inning from Thala. Didn't disappoint.,13
I love Dhoni because he is such a divisive player. Like I have never been convinced about his take it deep tactics but seemingly others will trust him into a war.,23
I love how if eventually CSK qualifies for the playoffs (like they‚Äôve always done) you guys will shut up.,0
It's scorching hot rn at Sharjah and Sanju deserve a lakh extra for carrying RR. See how they sweat  üò∞,21
"Also love how all the blame is on Dhenier but none on Vijay, Faf, Jadhav, Gaikwad etc.",-14
[deleted],8
Thank God he's retired for national team. Don't have stomach to see innings like this. Last WC was enough.,32
Being a fan of someone is like being in love you lose all objectivity and find a way to praise everything they do.,18
"No appreciation for Rajasthan Royals or it's players only dhoni, dhoni.. dhoni in here. He fucke this up like so many matches in past.. accept it move on. Let's talk about RR

Gopal wasn't as good as last season. 

Tevatia has some good talent.

Steve and samson had a very good partnership.

Jofra is as good as he always is. The batting was a plus.

T curran needs to be given rest.

Do you agree?",42
It's criminal how no one's even mentioning Faf and that heroic innings he played under pressure. Unbelievable the kind of score he ended with after taking his time to settle in.,32
"A lot of people are misreading opinions here. 

No, no one is blaming Dhoni for CSK's loss. Their bowling sucked, Murali Vijay's knock was atrocious and RR showed more hunger. 

Dhoni is being called out for his utterly selfish, useless, mind-numbing innings and rightfully so. You can call out Dhoni for his innings *without* holding him solely responsible for CSK's loss.",50
"So much Dhoni talk, he was barely part of the match.   And so much talk about intent. 99/100 times Dhoni would've just failed miserably had he gone for it with 18+ runs an over. Why is it more noble to hit and get out?

Y'all should stop thinking of Dhoni as an international batsman and start seeing him as an average IPL batsman and move on. And he's not bad enough to be dropped from CSK. Talk about other people ffs.",26
The weirdest thing that no one seems to realise is that CSK lost the game before Dhenier walked out. The middle overs test match batting killed any chances. 15+ RRR for 5-6 overs at the end is nuts.,-10
"Well in Dhoni's defense, he's retired and he still tried to reach as close.. Aw fuck it! He was shit again.",31
Cricbuzz's signing off paragraph mentions 'CSK' 4 times while the only 'RR' they used is in NRR. What a joke!,38
[deleted],0
"I don't get the Dhoni hate.. he was passing the strike to Faf, which was the right move, and ended with a 170 strike rate. 216 is a very demanding total, can't fault him too much",-20
"Oh Dhoni that was pure bait n watch, you were taking singles and putting pressure on Faf, and just when 4 balls were left you were hitting few 6s ....for what? You did same during the WC when you baited and putt pressure on Jadeja, how easy it would have been for everyone if you would also smash few hits along with other batsman?",35
to echo the Sanju fans from the NZ tour.. SANJU UYIR BAKI ELAM MYRE,10
Dhoni's Intent : New thread for cricket enthusiast to discuss looking at all the comments.,4

Today's match reminded me of IND vs NZ World Cup Semi final. Only difference being it was Jadeja then & Faf today.,29
Don‚Äôt worry people. I‚Äôll give hairdryer treatment to the entire team today,12

"That last over was some unbelievable stuff by Jofra. To take on Ngidi, of all bowlers, and to park him in the stands that way was just fabulous. Props to Samson for a great knock, he just needs to be consistent. Smith, great again. Wish Uthappa had got going, but he just picked the fielder out.

The less said about CSK - barring Watto and Faf - the better. They lacked ""intent"". It was again about NRR and keeping one's average up.",20
"Dhobi has to keep his average up as he seeks the validation of 200K redditors. 
If Dhobi = low average = rebellious CSK fans will find new Thalaallah.",1
Hahaah Dhobu fanbois NRR. Hahaha so dumb. I am more intelligent than Dhobu fanbois,-3
"The annoying thing about Thallalalalal Dhobu fanbois is how they are a cult and aren't open to their messiah being criticized.

OTOH we here on r/cricket pride ourselves in being open minded. If you like, the majority of cricket fans believe test cricket is boring, we downvote you to oblivion",12
two best SRs in the match? Archer and CurranS lol. What a world we live in.,12

"Tuk Tuk Toni, safe game as always. 

Unbeaten and ensuring 150+ strike rate, meanwhile not taking risk to score when needed. 

Once the game is won, the bowlers from other side relax and bowl freebies for Tuk Tuk Toni to increase his strike rate. He is smart.",25
"Dhoni to do list

1. Safeguard own wicket
2. Score run a ball - Tuk Tuk Toni
3. Don't take risk even when boundaries are mandatory to have any hope of winning, and safeguard own wicket, take only singles. 
4. Mathematically impossible to win now, opposing bowlers can relax with just legal deliveries without worrying about being scored from.
5. Now, get easier balls, hit couple of sixes, and move from15(15) to 27(17). Good strike rate and respectable stats achieved with risk free approach. Smart. 

But, media and fans - Dhoni fought till the end single handed.",58
