You see with CSK, it's rarely ever a violent loss like you could expect against say KKR where Russell comes out and pummels you into submission, but it drains you bit by bit. You start off thinking you have a chance and then hope drains out 1 bit at a time and in the final over, CSK somehow win. 

Good fucking luck RR. Gonna need it.",48

2020-09-22T14:37:16+00:00,SquiffyRae,Honestly my favourite part of the IPL each year is watching Samson bat. Such a beautiful batsman looks like he's got so much time. Reminds me a bit of Usman Khawaja. Beautiful technique and strokeplay but a little lazy at times. Pity he hasn't been able to put together a couple of really good seasons and make the case for India selection on a more regular basis,7
2020-09-22T14:37:17+00:00,aj_viz,Curious case of Samson. Fires up for 2 months during IPL and goes missing rest of the year in first class cricket. Rinse repeat year after year.,2

But for some reason a lot of U19 and inexperienced domestic players deliver almost instant success. The management didn‚Äôt need to be patient with Pandyas, Chahars, Kishan, Rana, Padikkal, etc because they delivered instantly. However some domestic players like Hooda never delivered despite immense patience shown to him. Wonder where SRH is going wrong with that.

2020-09-22T15:58:35+00:00,oliver_bread_twist,"My God. These Chode Boundaries‚Ñ¢ remind me of when we were chasing 8 off the last ball at our school ground. Thankfully, that tape ball tournament, coach decided to settle for wide off and leg boundaries, but at the cost of the runup coming from the boundary line. Wicket keeper on the boundary line too. 

Away team had a quota to fulfill. Gave the last over to Mr. Gruntdeep who graduated from Dinda Academy of Class Bowling (Class 2016). 

**Them:** 169 allout (20)

**Us:** 161 - 9 (19.5) 

12 runs needed off the last ball. Me on the non-striker's end with a solid 2\*(1). My frenemy, hardcore aficionado for DC, could barely hold a bat properly if Deccan Chargers' sole title was on the line. 

We get through five balls, scraping by 4 off these 5 deliveries. Man. This motherfucker Gruntdeep. Full on Sikh turban Harbhajan style, thick moustache, stray chin hairs. Storming into the pitch bowling these 60kph dibbly-dobblies outside off - all while letting out thes orgasmic grunt landing his foot at the crease. 

So. 8 needed off one. Praying Gruntdeep gifts DC-twig a wide where we can risk taking a single. Thinking I'm gonna pull a Brathwaite last ball. 

And then he starts running in - man's speeding in like he missed 10:55 AM Rawalpindi Express train. Now I start to digress from my Brathwaite heroics and think about what he may be thinking as he draws closer to the crease. 

*""Hum to Gruntdeep hai. Hum toh wicket karenge.""*  

That seems about rig‚Äî

*""AHUUU-HUFFFF-AAAAAH""*

Before I can finish my thought process, Gruntdeep storms into the pitch, letting out the sound five goats BLAAAA'ing on ketamine would make - with a little bit of distortion toward the end, of course. Because I kid you not, every fuck thing slowed down the second Gruntu let the ball out his left hand. 

DC-twigglylegs stammers for a second before taking a *massive* swing of the bat. Jesus. You best believe he got nowhere near that soaring 120 scorcher. But he wasn't the only one. Neither did the wicketkeeper. Nor the boundary. 

ll... a six. Didn't matter where it fucking came. But Gruntdeep, you *bloody* legend. Bottled it like a Tim Southee downing a Smirnoff after bowling a super over. Jesus. 

We couldn't have won it without you and your heroics. Granted, we got our cheeks clapped in the playoffs, the ten of us managing to put together a half-century that was chased in six overs. 

But I don't give three shits. Because this post is kindly brought to you by Chode Boundaries‚Ñ¢.",2

They do a great job in giving IPL a colorful and quality video quality. But they need to calm down on Thala and Super V dick sucking. 90 min of pre show is full of cringey praises of dhoni. Even greats like Sunny G & K.P has to do it too much. 



If we had won 2019 WC you could say well Aus broadcast used to do this in Ponting era too. But that team lived up to their hype never felt uncomfortable listening. "" Gee Punter is a hooker"" "" Gee Haydos Coming and murdering the Vas again"". 


Need to be more like Eng Broadcast. Everyone knows Naseer is in one sided love with Stokes. But he waites till Stokes does something special to lose his voice. Just this. Also Neroli Meadows might be thinking "" Indian people thinks only Dhoni & Kohli knows how to play Cricket üòÇüò≠"".

Props to Samson for a great knock, he just needs to be consistent. Smith, great again. Wish Uthappa had got going, but he just picked the fielder out.

The less said about CSK - barring Watto and Faf - the better. They lacked ""intent"". It was again about NRR and keeping one's average up.",20

Unbeaten and ensuring 150+ strike rate, meanwhile not taking risk to score when needed. 

Once the game is won, the bowlers from other side relax and bowl freebies for Tuk Tuk Toni to increase his strike rate. He is smart.",26
2020-09-22T22:18:12+00:00,chanlfc21,"Dhoni to do list

1. Safeguard own wicket
2. Score run a ball - Tuk Tuk Toni
3. Don't take risk even when boundaries are mandatory to have any hope of winning, and safeguard own wicket, take only singles. 
4. Mathematically impossible to win now, opposing bowlers can relax with just legal deliveries without worrying about being scored from.
5. Now, get easier balls, hit couple of sixes, and move from15(15) to 27(17). Good strike rate and respectable stats achieved with risk free approach. Smart. 

But, media and fans - Dhoni fought till the end single handed.",57
