He isnt just a t20 legend but a decent enough part time wicketkeeper, who can bat. He carried the whole ICL team after Rayudu left. What sets him apart from other players is he absolutely demolishes the batting attack. There is no rhythm to his destruction, he dosent care about being stylish or tries to go out of his ways. He plays by his strengths and that's what's allowed him to play for so long. Another thing that I genuinely like about him is how he enjoys the game. It dosent matter if he wins or loses, he's always smiling, dancing and makes you realise at the end of it the sport is just about enjoying yourself and being in the moment, fuck catches or stumpings! I genuinely thought he was done for after he was axed by the Sidemen but he's still going strong. It's a shame he isnt playing in the 100. No matter his form, he is one of the biggest crowd attractions and genuinely one of the most meatloaf evoking players on the planet.",-1

2020-10-03T18:34:27+00:00,warrenslaya,The Narine opening thing has to come to an end. They need someone to open with Gill. Either Tripathi or Banton  need to come even if it means Narine sits out. I'd say give a few chances more to Nagarkti/Mavi buyt they seem inconsistent. Sandeep Warrier and Prasidh were pretty good at one stage in terms of economy. Cummins has been inconsistent with the ball too,14
2020-10-03T18:35:15+00:00,,"If Banton for Narine works, calls will be there for DK to drop himself cuz Banton can keep as well",34
2020-10-03T18:36:10+00:00,sxd827,Lol cricbuzz commentary has Iyer saying 'Winning was icing on the cake.' Is he saying his innings was the cake and the team's win was the icing?,27
2020-10-03T18:50:43+00:00,appgeek,"Criticisms are fair, but I think we should also remember that we are talking about some guys who are special talents (1 in 10 million) who have worked really hard to get where they are. But yeah, they make mistakes, like the rest of us. Think of the time you did something stupid or were stuck in a rut and nothing seemed to work.",22
2020-10-03T19:10:31+00:00,Jy_sunny,Everyone was unnecessarily harsh on RCB’s death bowling all these years. They literally play half their matches at Chinnaswamy,30
2020-10-03T19:22:07+00:00,Kramer-Melanosky,KKR bowling was so bad. Cummins was the most disappointing to me. Karthik and Narine should justify their position.,19
2020-10-03T19:48:03+00:00,singhsrb,DC on top and CSK at the bottom. I thought I would never see it in my lifetime. Long may it last!,24
2020-10-03T23:01:10+00:00,singhsrb,"If Shaw is injured, Delhi will be closer to finding their best XI:

Stoinis
Dhawan
Rahane
Iyer
Pant
Axar
Sams
Ashwin
Rabada
Nortje
Mishra

4 fast bowling option, 3 spinning options. Never chasing more than 150-160 which that batting line up will handle easily on most days.",-13
2020-10-04T01:47:29+00:00,cherry0079,Do you guys agree that RCB would have done a lot better if they have not played at Chinnaswamy all these years? All teams bowling like shit at Sharjah made me realise that.,16
2020-10-04T01:52:49+00:00,cherry0079,To everyone asking why they sent Cummins before Tripathi it’s a Indian thing guys... they spent 15 crores on Cummins and they want to make it worth ever penny no matter if you lose or win the match. :P,13
