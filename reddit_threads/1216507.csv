Well well well,2
Russell be licking his fingers rn,1
Now I want Dc to win  this match,0
Please play Rahane and Ashwin,2
"No idea whom to support. 

Hopefully 
Shaw, 
Pant, 
Sheryas, 
Gill, 
Mavi, 
Nagakoti play well",6
[deleted],-1
Looks like Tripathi is in for Kuldeep,5
"I’m clearly not a KKR supporter but do KKR fans recall any great innings for KKR by Pandey (excluding the 2014 final)? I haven’t watched all of KKR’s past games but I can still recall many good performances by the usual suspects (Gambhir, Uthappa, Yusuf, Russell, etc) but nothing much from Pandey.",3
"Oh boy, Delhi is gonna be destroyed tonight. 

Russell, Morgan, DK on Sharjah? Fucked. Gill, Rana are also in good form.",4
"Finally Kuldeep is dropped. We needed a bit of depth in our batting.

And Morgan needs to come up ahead of Karthik.",2
"Boys, Tripathi is finally playing. Thank goodness.",7
"Yes Yes Yes! 

No Axar. That's half the battle won. Go bc!!",1
Excited for ash,1
"fuck yeah, comrade ashwin in the team. Rooting for DC tonight",2
Wait no Ishant? Any idea why?!,2
Ashwin to take Sharjah's pitch out of equation by mankading the entire team.,2
I want to see Ashwin mankad DK and then DK angrily cursing Ashwin in Tamil.,5
"Ashwin is so exciting. Guys a matchwinner, underrated in T20s.",5
"Let's be honest it was a long time coming for Kuldeep. Hopefully, he bounces back. Axar unlucky to be dropped but understandable as Mishraji is the better bowler.",3
DC have batting depth tonight. Watch them squander it by top order tuk-tuk.,1
I am here Bois let's goooo,3
Off topic but life is good :),11
Great decision by KKR management to ensure Narine doesn't open. Would've been toast against Rabada and Nortje.,3
everyone shifting onto this thread,2
Hoping for an exciting & a close game with DC winning :),1
"Changed my flair for this match, don’t let me down like Sharjahsthan Royals just did.",8
So excited to see the brain of R Ashwin here on this ground. Let's see how he goes,6
ASHWIN IS BACK?,3
"Narine not opening too? Damn, when did our management start using their brains?",8
Will be a high scoring match and very close methinks,1
Hyped for ashwin,5
Where can I see the lineups? Cricinfo link the post is showing error,1
Choosing a fantasy team is so difficult.,3
"Off topic but a bummer from Official Fantasy as we cant make any changes for this 2nd Match. 

Teams for both matches are locked at start of 1st match it seems.",5
need some of that meat from Russel and pant Tonight ಠ_ಠ,2
I'm just here watch my crush Cummins in action.,5
Hyped for this match. DC are a tough team in this tournament.,1
I really hope Tripathi does well and doesn't turn out to be a one-season wonder (2017) like Valthaty or Asnodkar. He surprised everyone by doing super well in 2017 but was given limited opportunities by RR in 2018-19. Now hopefully he does something of note for KKR.,1
Good change to bring Ashwin. His variations are useful for spin dominant pitches.,1
I do not care how deserving other players are and what the so-called team balance implications would be. Not including rahane in the team is CRIMINAL. FUCK the team management,1
"Kkr wins the toss and chooses to bowl. See you tomorrow guys, DC has won this match.",1
Cummings only fans when ??,2
Sharjajajaja,2
the desert sucks all the energy and dehydrates you. qatar football wc will see so many dehydration related substitutions.,3
[deleted],1
Shaw's nicking another one to the keeper tonight isn't he...,1
Eoin at 5 is wasted. Karthik is better as a finisher than an accumulator. They should swap positions.,3
can someone pray away my gay??,0
DC bat first nice,2
DC line up looking really solid,3
Dc looks so solid ffs. Just imagine Ishant Sharma instead of Harshal Patel.,2
Me jumping from RCB vs RR sub to this sub.. PARKOUR,13
"FFS, is Narine opening?",2
Hyped for some CumSlog Millionaire,6
Narine gonna go hard in this small stadium,2
how to flair up guizzz??,2
"RCB gonna win IPL.

Come at me.",2
Mankad time letzooo,4
is it possible for both teams to lose?,3
That ground is so small and that road seems to be quite busy.. careful with the six hitting please,1
"Acar Patel dropped, should have dropped Mishra instead",2
"Sunny G: every team has an exciting young Indian player

CSL: (ノ｀Д´)ノ彡┻━┻",1
"Make way for the King!!!

Raviii Ashwiiinnnnnn!!!!!!!!!!!!",2
russell gonna be licking his lips,1
What are the changes for KKR?,2
Eoin Murugan needs to bat up top,3
If Morgan is wasted at 6 again today gonna lost my shit,6
"Harshal Patel was the fourth highest run getter in the previous domestic t20 comp. 374 runs @ 31.2, sr of 165.5",1
Here we go,1
Shaw is either going to really destroy Cummins or look completely clueless against him. Nothing in between.,2
"I swear if we don't open with Tripathi, i am going to kill a man",3
Why remove Axar?,1
Let the six-hitting contest begin.,2
Excellent point made by scotty styris. Should have played with an extra bowler. On a flat wicket you won't lose those many wickets,1
"Years of development in CGI

Classic-Copter is still shit",3
"Which format does Dhawan play today?
I guess T20 since it's Sharjah heaven",2
Here we go first ball,1
Shaw is over hyped due to Mumbai lobby. Padikkal miles ahead,6
300 runs incoming.,1
"Sunny G: ""every team has an exciting young Indian player""

CSK: (ノ｀Д´)ノ彡┻━┻",10
Does anyone else have issues with the yupptv telecast?,1
Who do you guys think will win?,1
A whole box of balls is going to be lost today,1
What's up with cumdog's hair lmao,1
Another 400 game? Maybe 450?,1
Feeling like a 250 score tonight the way ball is coming up to bat,1
"Sunny G, if you actually paid attention, you'd have noticed Dhawan never takes the strike, be it a youngster or a CSK player.",20
need a wicket upfront from cummins to keep this interesting,2
"Every team bar CSK and KXIP have one sexy Australian in the team. Both are bottom now.

Coincidence?",4
CMV:Shaw is just a shite sehwag,7
I've put 4 of my friends around the ground for collecting Balls to play our street cricket.,3
Sexyyy from shaw,1
gg EZ Shaw,2
someone must have fixe Cummins haircut,4
Cumdog rocking the same haircut as Cletus from the Simpsons,4
How much is a safe score here with Russell in the chasing side? 250? 300?,1
"Both teams have made good changes , hopefully Narine does not open for KkR today",7
Boundary cushions should be removed for a ground this small.,7
That one fielder at no man's land. What's up with him?,2
Why don’t they mark stump lines on the crease so that batsmen don’t scrape the pitch out?,3
Hotstar choppy for anyone else?,2
How tf is Prithvi losing hair at 20 and growing that pedo stache. Someone bring back the young naïve lad that we initially saw.,21
Greatly played 1st over from Delhi,1
sexy shaw just sounds so weird to me and I have Cumming to Cummins for the last 2 matches ಠ_ಠ,2
[deleted],5
Comically short boundaries. Rohit would score 300 in an ODI against SL here.,8
This is the kind of pitch where Dhawan will score 70(50) and lose the match for DC,6
Dhavan has a lot of competition now with plenty of young openers playing well,6
"In the midst of all the csk and dhoni batting fiasco, dk’s performance has not been given the attention and criticism it deserves. Dude’s batting ahead of Eoin fuckin Morgan displacing him from his usual #4 spot but doesn’t score anything",65
Have missed Gabbar's cuts. May be tonight's the night,2
Wow over 30 yard circle and one bounce to the boundary. Welcome to miniature Cricket.,2
Delhi replaced a Patel with another Patel,3
"This IPL makes me feel old. As a 90's kid, back in the mid 2000's Ishant Sharma was a role model for budding cricketers because he made his debut when he was 19. But now I see all these players who were born after me, and I feel old.",10
"Ashwins real challenge today on a small sharjah ground,and maybe against russell.",3
"With Harshal and Ashwin at 7 and 8, DC bat real deep tonight.",3
"Kkrs senior core is shaping up quickly. DK, Morgan, Dre and Cummins.",4
"Still remember Iyer smashing Mavi for 4 odd sixes in the final over in his first match as a captain, something like that would be good today.",2
"Everyone's rooting for Dre Rus to hit big today,

What happens when gets chocked by Kagiso like last IPL?",3
Shaw has an advantage today. He must have played Mavi and Nagarkoti many many times in the nets.,3
Omg what a carry,2
Hope Pant comes in at 3,4
Mavi eyeing the spider cam while bowling,1
Great comeback from Mavi after the first boundary ball.,1
interesting that kkr only have 5 bowling options at sharjah.,1
Does anyone else feel like the video quality of this match is definitely worse than the first match (Hotstar)?,5
Who built this ground so tiny? Surely in the UAE where there is plenty of money and resources available they would've built a bigger one?,3
What’s the highest viewers on Hotstar so far in this ipl? Is the current 20L high/low?,2
This is the same venue where RR chased down 223,1
Looks like Mavi's eyes are pointing towards sky while pitching.  More chances of dropping return catches perhaps or difficulty in making last sec adjustments?,2
Good decision to drop kuldeep today. Not really a bowler for such small boundaries.,5
I’m glad pat cummins changed the lizard tail haircut,3
"Dinda would reach the skies before he was about to release it, Mavi looks up at the sky before he was about to release it, is he looking up at Dinda",7
DC's gotta bowl well if they wanna win tonight 'cause this pitch is extremely batting friendly,2
That dot ball in the previous over was celebrated like a wicket from the non existent crowd.,7
"Most people look at the batsman when they bowl, Mavi looks at God.",5
"KKR should have dropped Narine for Ferguson. Playing two spinners on this ground is suicide, no matter how good they are and Narine hasn't been that good",5
Was this ground built so that no-name UAE players could hit sixes,3
off topic but City vs Leeds gonna be good,0
all these cred app fans of the game are  actually held in prisons and they have to act excited to get their next meal,7
"151.7kph ball pulled away like that, geez.",8
Wtf is this haircut. Did he cut his own hair,3
Cummins bowling at 152!!,10
Woooof,3
148 kph that was. Earthboy on fire.,6
Damn Shaw 😳,2
one smol boi tonking the best bowler in the world,8
"Pat Cummins bowls at almost 152 kmph

Me: Feels like old times...",8
Cummins is bowling above 150 🔥,8
Shot shaw,3
Why is Cummins bowling this short delivery again? It's an absolutely retarded strategy on these pitches and ground.,5
In the Joy vs KP battle I am taking KP's side. Feels weird,2
Hahahaha. A small Indian dude smacking an Australian for a six at Sharjah. I have seen this before,48
Shaw has some special love for KKR😥,5
"Quicker they come , faster they go.",5
"**Powerplay overs venue-wise in IPL 2020**

*Run-rate*

Dubai - 6.78

Sharjah - 9.90

Abu Dhabi - 7.06

*Wickets lost*

Dubai - 21

Sharjah - 2

Abu Dhabi - 15",47
my man Lockie done dirty.,2
I’d like to see the average bowler economy rate at this ground so far,1
Why are boundries in at Sharjah.. Atleast utilize the full field!,5
200's looking good at the moment,1
if I was a bowler I would fake an injury before matches at Sharjah,10
DC can only hope that Dhawan doesn't play a Rahul like knock here.,5
Nothing better than enjoying batting prowess with r/cricket on a Saturday evening 😌,2
"The pitch looks really good, the faster you bowl, the better is coming on the bat. Need to bowl variations and be unpredictable to keep DC under 210 here.",3
I do believe Shaw is Ravi Shastri's son,2
what type of drugs is Iyer on,4
Bro how come Shaw looks like a middle aged unkil @ 20. Hairloss at such a young age is fucking cruel,14
Man I feel like Ashwin is going to get absolutely cunted out of this ground,7
Delhi playing great right no. Keep it up👏🏽👍🏽,2
Why doesn't Nagarkoti bowl during PP? I don't understand this. He used to bowl 1st over for U-19 team always.,5
"All of Delhi's batting performances uptill this match have been really scrappy

Hope some players look to time the ball first rather than slog from ball one",3
DC needs at least 200 to feel comfortable enough to defend,7
This pitch is criminally short,4
Why is the camera angle so low in sharjah?,5
I just want Rishabh to go off tonight,14
"Ricky Ponting there, with the unique way of getting through an energy drink...snorting it so it gets straight into the blood stream.",7
Dhawan can win it for kkr,11
"This hair cut is result of the spat that SRK and Cummins had earlier in the day

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjHOtxCRhnw",3
Most insecure GF ever would be of Pat Cummins.,2
Peach,1
"On paper, DC has one of the most exciting batting lineups. They have done a great job of making it. If they fail it has to be boneheadedness or terrific bowling. Will see...",6
Dhawan is looking to build an innings in Sharjah ...it's a hitfest bro.,38
When was the last time dhawan played a match winning innings?,12
Lol shreyas slapping the shit out of himself,2
why didnt varun get games at kxip if he's actually decent?,8
Imagine gayle in form on this ground....,19
Dhawan: *fuck you r/cricket*,20
Lol DK 'let him hit',10
This ground is so small the powerplay fielding restrictions dont make sense,8
DC looks full of confidence,2
Haha Dhawan trolling r/cricket😂😂😂,6
A spinner in powerplay sharjah giving 7 runs ? That's criminal,21
dk looks disappointed everytime the balls goes to the boundary. he gotta adjust his expectations real quick.,9
"Dhawan is in an awkward position even in ODI's for India. Yes, he's always done well. Yes, he's done nothing wrong whatsoever. But selection is never a fair process. His World Cup injury came at the worst possible time. I wonder if selectors will be looking only into the future for all 3 formats for India.",9
It's already looking like a high scoring game,7
Ashwin is going to Mankad Morgan tonight,17
"Lol. DK instructing Varun in Tamil. ""Adikattum Adikattum"" ""Let him hit it""",5
cant wait for russel to nuke the bowlers today,3
"Harshal Patel was painfully shite for RCB

Expect a 35(10) from him tonight",2
I  think maybe KKR spinners won't find it that difficult to adapt. Eden is a similar size. Maybe only slightly bigger,1
DC does have the best team on paper.,6
"Andy Zaltzman answering my questions:

Seam bowler economy at Sharjah so far this tournament: 10.88

Spin bowlers: 10.43",6
Dhawan : yeah talk nah,0
"Yes Gabbar, hit this fraud out of the tournament.",0
Even I can hit sixes here.,9
Shikar Dhaawaan!,3
Win the toss & lose the match?,6
Dhawan back in form r/cricket in mud,1
Dhawan looks to be in some mood today,2
How shit was 90's cricket if they weren't able to clear this embarrassment of a ground.,6
Dhawan sweeps for six. Next ball: I will fucking do it again,9
God damn shiki boy,3
"Dhawan rn: So r/cricket, you were saying??😂",10
I feel Narine has lost his sting recently,11
You know its going to be a run fest when even Shikar Dhawan gets going in the Powerplay.,9
Kuldeep laughing at a distance,13
So DC is compensating for its earlier slow starts in this match,8
[deleted],7
Smh narine used to be unplayable. Wtf happened?,3
The ground size is genuinely a joke lmao.,6
"Tom Banton not playing in this ground

KKR 100 IQ",15
I have been to this ground. Its actually even smaller than it looks on tv. I think the type of lenses these ppl use makes grounds look bigger than they actually are.,3
"Watson for csk, Narine for kkr ...both teams backing their misfiring stars to the hilt.",3
Pant should come in next,4
"He is pretty honest about it, good on him.",6
These commentators have absolutely no clue. Dhawan got run out in the first game and running between the wickets cost them their last game against SRH.,5
How did that miss the stumps?,2
Every team openers are performing except CSK ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯,7
Just wanna see Pant go apeshit today,7
Oh Prithvi! Watch out. Just rotate.,5
Harshal Patel is going to get slaughtered here,2
Ohhhh it's unacademy. I thought Khan Academy was sponsoring the IPL.,7
"51 in 5 overs

*::rubs eyes::*

Well I'll be damned",6
Yup we're gonna score 200,2
"Dhawan needs an unique combination of small ground, flat track, poor bowling and some dew so that he could bat like t20 in a t20 match",7
"There is a hint of turn out there, Ashwin and Mishra could be handy in the 2nd innings.",2
Will Narine open today his mishits may also go for six,2
[deleted],6
Love that Delhi chick🤗,3
;-;,2
Only 2 wickets have fallen in the powerplay across the 4 innings in this ground. That's genuinely comical.,2
"Man I can’t wait for the game tomorrow on this ground. Bairstow, Warner, Williamson (Even Rashid!) vs. Pollard, Rohit and Pandya on this ground. It may be small, but it gives damn good games, looking forward to the second innings",7
[deleted],8
This is the complete opposite of the CSK innings from yesterdat,3
HOW DID THEY NOT REVIEW THAT???,6
Dhawan is probably the only batsman that can make a sweep shot look amazing one night or just about stupid the other.,3
"Since 2017, Narine is averaging 34 with the ball in IPL.",5
Stop showing us Women in the Dugout,5
"**Gabbar v Sunil Narine in the IPL**

Before Today - 49 runs, 49 balls, 2 sixes

Today - 13 runs, 3 balls, 2 sixes

*Sharjah Effect*",8
That looked out.,3
"I was surprised when Shaw was fastracked into indian team instead of gill...gill looked far better player in the u19 wc.

However post the wc , Shaw has been making his chances count. Gill is really yet to set the scene on fire.",2
"are some spectators allowed, who are these people",4
"Stop showing us, women, in the dugout",-2
KKR top 2 fielding teams,3
Send in shimron now,3
I am biased but this is one of my fav opening pairs in the tournament.,3
okay morgs that was pretty damn cool,6
Expected. Why not try some other shot Dhawan,3
"Shaw's strength is square of the wicket, nothing down the ground. Got to pitch it up to him.",3
One sweep too many from Gabbar,2
Ummmm yassss! It went so high,3
Lmao shikhar,3
Like I mean c'mon this is going to be a monsoon of runs and Shikar's gone. Good bowling by Mithun.,2
lucky Morgan was underneath it,11
Great catch Morgu,3
How do you get caught in this ground?,3
Quality bowling by Varun,2
Lara said last over Gabbar gets out playing the sweep and here we are,4
"Thank god Narine was not under that catch.
Thanks Morgan!",4
ShimRUN pls,1
Well Varun is our Kuldeep now,7
Dhawan realised he should be leaving at high Strike rate,4
Holing out in Sharjah ? Unacceptable,6
lmao dhawan can't even clear sharjah boundaries.,7
In Sharjah you live by the sword and die by the sword. Good contribution Gabru 👌👌,-1
"**5.5** Varun to Dhawan, OUT,  **56-1**

"DK captain of the team, Morgan the captain of our hearts",4
"I'mma keep it real with y'all, I'm the Serial downvoter 😔",-10
"As long as every batsman plays this quick cameo, this is actually what is needed for T20s imo. A quick fire 30 off less than 20 balls is what needed if 3-4 batsmen can do that in an innings",6
"Morgan keeping in tradition with Faf, shows how not to be BBL",4
"Guys, KKR has two stars on their jersey, in the last match RR had one. Why don’t DC & RCB have any? :?

Varun looks quality tbh.,5
KKR would want Iyer to bat as long as possible,4
Padikkal and Shaw will probably open the batting for India post Rohit/Dhawan era,1
Dhawan’s fav / only shot against spin is sweep. I’d love to see how many times he’s gotten out to spin with a sweep.,1
Again with these stupid ass CRED ads,1
Short partnerships are actually better than long ones in T20 I think.,2
"Narines stock bowling is down and his fielding is barely passable.his batting has not been upto the mark as well.
Hopefully they get lockie Ferguson in for next match",1
That looks plumb lbw,0
Just saw Polycab ad featuring Ayushman Khurana. Wes Anderson is so mainstream now that even Indian ad makers are copying him. But this was a such a horrible rendition of Moonrise Kingdom.,2
"DK is taking too much to himself. Afterbeing sidelined for so long, I understand his want to prove himself. But he is a finisher and coming at 3/4 isn't doing himself good.",0
Sharjah is the holy ground for batsmen that many request their ashes to  be scattered over it,6
Varun’s facial expressions are a bit off putting imo,2
Muscle Russell 😘,1
Is KKR the least supported IPL team in r/cricket this year?,6
"So if Delhi can get a pretty big score here and then KKR lose a couple of early wickets, I’d quite enjoy watching a solid chunk of Eoin Morgan on this ground.",5
Russell bowling before Nagarkoti is depressing me. What is wrong with DK?,-2
Next year's IPL gonna be in March-April? Like in six months time?,12
Something about a dude about as large as LeBron who bowls slower than Mark Ealham is hilarious to me.,4
The only way you score a double in this ground is to hit it high and the fielder drops it,10
Christ how many time is Shivaramakrishnan gonna bring up that India v Pakistan game?,4
"Who do y’all think KKR are retaining in the mega auction? Dre Russ is a given, imo. Probably Shubman Gill too. Idk about Narine given his recent form, but maybe?",5
Mike Nichols and Siva are like talking past each other.,1
I hate Laxman Sivaraman Krishnan so much. Just a really shitty commentator 😖,0
"Feel sad for the RR & KKR boys, they have to wear that TV9 logo on their jerseys. LOL!  
Really surprised that shit like TV9 is also sponsoring in IPL. Standards!",5
Iyer better step it up today. His usual run-a-ball 30 will fuck the team upside down in a ground like this.,1
The female commentator has such a boring voice,1
"""Can anyone forget the desert storm?""

*crickets chirping*",0
God level over from Dre russ,2
"I wonder which  batsman has the lowest average in Sharjah, probably Salim Malik  🤣️",-1
"Shreyas really messes up the momentum, man.",4
Russ has become much better bowler in recent time,4
"I love our team and believe in them. But as a Delhi fan for so long, I shit bricks every time we play. Until we win. Even now I am scared that this pitch and ground, Russell will kill us.",4
Do you think KKR should send Morgan in earlier this time? I think on this pitch he’s a better bet up the order than DK and Narine,2
Two good overs from KKR to pull things back,5
Iyer comes in and unsurprisingly the runrate starts slowing down once again.,2
[deleted],4
Today was the best opportunity to unleash Rishab Pant the opener by moving Dhawan to 3.,3
Iyer come on mannnnn,2
Why would you not send Hetmyer in at 3 on a ground designed for six hitting?,4
Iyer is a truly great ODI no.4. but painfully average in t20,5
I was watching the NBA playoffs final earlier. The nba knows how to do fake crowd noise. The cricket fake crowd noise is pretty bad tbh.,1
"They brought in pacers against Iyer. He better do something today.

Should've brought Pant or Stoinis, smh.",2
lowkey snooze,1
DC is wasting Stoinis,3
Sunil Narayan,2
"Bloody hell. Delhi need to score big here, can't be happy with 180.",3
Anything less than 210 will be an easy chase for KKR?,3
Did they end up showing us the ball tracking of Shaw's potential LBW? It looked out to me,1
What franchise do the majority of r/india users support? I want to know the most hated franchise,5
Is the ball ok?,6
Is the pitch as flat as previous games?,1
"As a batsman if you miss out on a big score on Sharjah, that's the most disappointing thing there is.",6
Underwhelming start tbh,2
Iyer may replace Rahane in test team also,7
"Keep shitting on him guys, Iyer bout to do a tewatia for us",1
Did Ishant play last DC match? I don't remember,3
With the quality of bowling Delhi has the least they need is 170 I think,1
Credit to KKR for holding on and grooming Mavi. Kid has potential,7
Far too slow. Jeez.,3
On a side note I think r/cricket shitting on Kohli was what was holding him back. The reddit outage took up a lion's share of the RCB innings and the man got to his 50. Some players achieve greatness when we shit on them others fall under the weight of our expectations.,16
"PP ""big PP"" Shaw",2
Sachin'esuqe from Shaw. Great shot,2
"Thank god for Shaw, tuk tuk Iyer still unable to find a boundary",2
I'd let Prithvi Shaw hang around my kids,5

Still cant believe rcb had the easiest chase this season. They hardly broke a sweat,7
'cant wait to see rohit bat in sharjah' is what im thinking rn.,6
For punjab that stat should be if mayank scores 80+ kxip lose 100% of their matches.,5
Prithvi trying to get into Sunny G's good books with a single after the 6,29
Didn't Iyer smash Shivam Mavi for 29 in an over?,9
Shaw batting like this at Sharjah doesn't surprise me at all.,9
Fuck CEAT,4
"god, that car is ugly",6
[Shaw right now under the helmet](https://gfycat.com/fr/linearbriskdungbeetle),5
Arey fuck this strategic time out,9
What a ‘Shaw’t is probably the cringiest thing I’ve read this week,6
DC bois seem to have come out with some intensity today. All 3 of them have tried to maximize returns. Pitch has helped so far. Gl,4
Something about a MRF bat smashing sixes in sharjah...,5
"Delhi is aiming for 250, clear instructions from Ponting to not let the aggression go. Lets gooooooo",7
Need at least 200 in this ground. Otherwise Russel will just cakewalk the chase imo.,2
I will chance my flair to that team for a week whoever hits that car first,4
Genuinely see Carey walking into the team if Hetty doesn't perform today. The latter is far too poor at playing shots on his off side.,6
Ok i take it back. Shaw might not be overrated.,7
"KKR & DC put together can form the core of future Indian team (Shaw, Iyer, Pant, Mavi, Gill, Nagarkoti) .... oooh",6
"No Mr. Commentator, nobody has ever said their favorite is the ceat strategic time out ffs",8

"Even with our bowling prowess, we still need at least 200 on this graveyard.",3
So proud of the boys. Bottom of fair play!,8
Why does Shaw look like someone who would be on the sex offender's list?,3
I think this could be RCB’s year if they brought in Moeen instead of Finch to open. He opens for Worcestershire and hit a 50 ball hundred for them last year along with plenty of other big knocks. Also can bowl 1 or 2 overs to take pressure off the other bowlers.,2
"Tell me a better joke than fairplay awards, you have a year’s time",13

I think Delhi needs a better captain,4
CSK should be at the bottom of the fairplay based on Dhonis antics yesterday,8
[removed],1
They are trying to keep the spinners away from Iyer but he is getting set in the meanwhile. Should be interesting if he does survive to face the spinners.,0
Replace Hetmyer with Roy or Carey,0

That's one way to get him out.,2

"9 overs done and Delhi's biggest six hitters - Pant, Hetmyer and Stoinis - haven't faced a single ball. 

They're losing the game right here. These two need to get out ASAP for the team's sake. Anything under 215 is going to be a cakewalk for KKR.",6
Thanks a lot tuktuk Iyer,10
Only Iyer can make us feel like this is not a regular Sharjah ground and he is at it already,2
"Russell is bowling very well today, considering the ground size",12
3 run over lol,6
Why dont they replace Hetmyer with Roy or Carey?,0
What good bowling by Dre,2

Commentators: he gave up and would have been run out.",2

I see absolutely no reason for sending Iyer ahead of Pant. Could well cost Delhi this game,1
"Iyer is such a stupid captain. Stoinis is jn form, Pant is in form, they can hit better than him. But, no, he has to bat at 3 and do his fuckn tuk tuk. Ridiculous.",1

Man Russell’s run up feels so slow but he still bowls around 140. Impressive,4
"Fuck me what a spell Dre Rus, 7 runs in 2 overs on this ground.",3
2 overs for 7 runs is a man of the match performance on this ground,1
Is Shaw capped?,2
"Whenever Prithvi Shaw runs fast between the wickets or while fielding, I have an irrational fear that he might get dismantled.",1
Of all players Russel with 7 runs of 2 overs,2

Iyer time.,0
Mills looked like one of those teleshopping sellers trying to sell us a carpet.,0
"With Russell on the opposite side and this being Sharjah, the safest score would be in the 220s right?",1
They need 250 to counter Dre Russ,0
Iyer need to go in this over... go big or go back to dugout,7
"Yesterday social media was shitting on dhoni when he was showing signs of fatigue ..c'mon he is 38 year old with no cricket behind him in last year or so..

Today we could see even the young chaps like paddikal ,Shaw not able to cope up with the heat.

wanted to break that car.,4
Prithvi Shaw still super lazy about running and grounding his bat - after getting run out like this last season.,3
Russel with godly figures of 2-0-7-0,2
So why DC have brought in Patel for Sharma?,6
Even 200 - 215 is not safe on this ground. DC needs to up this in next 11 overs. Else Russel/Morgan will make merry on this mickey mouse size ground.,2
"Hahahaha, cmon shreyas man you can't just play against the spinners with INTENT",1
Guess Iyer doesn’t like the car either,3
Yasss. Smash that car next time.,4
I'm a Kp fan but sometimes his commentary can be a bit diabolical.,2
How did so many people get into the stadium? VIP Quota?,5
narine thinking how he's going get revenge for these sixes when batting.,4
Iyer can't play express pace,3
"Shreyas Iyer vs Spinner

Suicidal decision",5

I wonder if players have an internal bet going around as to who hits that fugly car in the stands which they get as a 'gift',2
Good decision to drop Kuldeep today in this ground. The guy would have gone for figures of 3-0-50-0 for sure.,10
"Few inches to the right and it would have hit the car, would have loved it",13
Sunny G intensifies,2
Bc Shaw take more risk or get out. Wtf,2
I just realised Nagarkoti is playing as specialist fielder. He doesn't get to bowl much and bats at 8. They gave Russell an over to counter Iyer and forgot Narine will be eaten alive by that same batsman.,6
[deleted],8
I also have the Dortmund game in the background. That Jude Bellingham is special.,3
Haha Iyer hurting Swanny's little toy!,2
Is this the lowest score in the first 10 overs at Sharjah this IPL?,8
Narine bowling absolute garbage here.,4
"Got to get a move on in a stadium like this. Samson, Agarwal, Du Plessis were all around 70/75 runs after 30 balls",4
BEHENCHOD SINGLE SINGLE MKC,2
"With this KKR batting, anything less than 225 is risky.",5
We are 20 short of halfway score. Need minimum 120 in next 10 now. Lot of firepower to come. Let's hit it..,4
KP showing how to pronounce Nortje,1
Iyer looks so casual cool and old school while hitting these stand and deliver sixes. Really refreshing.,2
it's a smol ground. they must score in excess of 200 to have a chance,2
Look at Shreyas. He has only played 10 balls. Much of that sweat comes from being the Captain in IPL,0
What a delivery,2
"Go big or get out when u have Pant, Stoinis, Heytmyer in dugout",1
Any reason why Gavaskar is pronouncing Narine that way?,1
Right on the money from ball one!,1
Shaw is playing slow given how much time he has had on the crease,1
I have pant as captain in my fantasy pls come to bat next,2
"Why is Nagarkoti, a proper bowler, not being given overs?",1
You don’t expect a Kamlesh to be a 19 year old. Sounds like a 55 year old uncle,7
KKR really going after Prithvi's foot here,3
Oi Nagarkoti respecc your kaptaan and bowl a few half volleys,2
r/cricket isn't satisfied unless everyone is smashing 4 sixes in every over.,8
Manjot Kalra only stain on 2018 U19 win,1
Anything less than 250 is doubtful on this pitch against Morgan. Unless DC can get Morgan and Russel out early in their game they don't have much chance. But then again you never know who might end up shining in Sharjah.,1
"**Scores after 10 overs at Sharjah in the five innings completed in IPL2020**

CSK - 82/4

RR - 119/1

KXIP - 110/0

RR - 104/2

DC - 89/1",10
Shaw just trying to give sunny g a boner with all those singles and rotating of strike,5
The more we see Iyer it's becoming apparent he's not comfortable against pace,1
"We need 250 here, start swinging boys and Shaw just started",1
"If KKR are so hell bent on having a pinch hitter as an opener, can't they have Nagarkoti open? Drop Narine, bring in Ferguson.",2
"KKR bowling well given the given, also Shaw should get a move on or just get out. Anything less than 220 is fair game here",-2
Sehwag must be clapping watching this on TV. His legacy lives on,7
"Ground kun why are you so smol? 

Ground kun: uWu",3
"Iyer should go big or go home from now. 10 more overs remaining and the firepower of Pant, Hetmeyr and Stoin are yet to bat.",5

Sharjah-- Where bowlers go to die.,3
Bc out ho ja yar. Every ball Hetmyer and pant don't get is a win for KKR. TAKE MORE RISKS BKC,0
"Idk why iyer came to bat, there is no need of  anchoring the innings here.",9
Delighted to see Shaw and Padikkal 50s today,5
Big hitters like hetmyer should come in soon in a ground like this.,2
KKR needs wicket here tbh with Stoinis coming 240+ is very possible,2
And that’s how you jinx it,1
I now know why Sachin loved making runs on this ground.,1
"The moment indian commentator starts commenting in English, you feel like inko hindi me bhi bhej do please.",3
Nothing funnier than slowmo of bowlers blowing air through their lips,6
Slowyer still batting,3

They should just make a green top on this ground and make it some sort of fair between bat and ball.,2
"If KKR opens with Narine again, I'll actually call Mamata didi to register the complaint.",11
"If scoring at 150 SR is tuk tuk, i hope everyone tuk tuks.",1
Suweet timing,2
Yeah.. Don't think Kamlesh is getting another over after that one.,1
"Does this already have more sixes than the previous game, in total?",2
"DC Need all these runs though, Russell and Co won't take their time settling in.",3
Nagarkoti go brrrrrrr,1
A friking flick goes all the way,3
Shreyas needs a 50 to get his confidence back. He's the key to our batting I think. Him anchoring and scoring at a decent pace will win us many games.,4
Bowler shouldn't be blamed here at all,1
https://twitter.com/AlexHartley93/status/1312395864783179777,3
Pretty nonsense over that but I will take it!,1
here we go DC. You can't get a better platform than this to tee off now,1
Prithvi come on fire from now on,3
Everybody talking about how Russell and Morgan can chase anything but forgetting about Rabada’s yorkers,4
Bad lines by Koti.,1
Chalo ek to out hoga is over me,1
Stoinis not gonna get a chance again while iyer wastes deliveries,-4
"Honestly I need to eat my words for giving Sanju Manju way too much shit. Listening to LS, Anjum, Murali, and other Indian commentators its clear that he's the best we can do after Bhogle",9
At Sharjah I feel it's very tough to differentiate between good and bad bowlers both get tonked for sixes,4
Need to know what narine is bribing dk with,1
Bc 50 partnership of 32 balls. Bat faster bkc,4
"I hope this pitch becomes a dust bowl, there should be something for the bowlers",6
We are fucked tonight. Russell will have to rescue us somehow.,3
Mumbai had 100 in the 15th over and almost ended with 200. DC are fine here.,1
OK BUT VARUNS FACE WAS WAY TOO FUNNY ABBAHAHAH,10
Fuck sharjah,3
The fucking eyes,27
Lmao this game is really not for bowlers.,4
What was that look,12
Varun looks like he just got up from bed and came straight to the ground.,8

I'll take it,3
I need that gif,9
Sunny G has a thing on Mumbai bois,2
How big are chakravarthy's eyes,7
Someone please make a gif of that incredible confused expression of Varun Chakraborty thanks 🙏,15

Well that would have been six on even in Melbourne,8
"Iyer is love, Iyer is life",3
Iyer is a spinner killer.,3
Iyer at his comfortable best against spin,6
Wow spin is bread and butter for iyer,6
With Pant and Hetmyer to come we might see the highest score of this IPL tonight.,3
No one asked but FYI Prithvi means Earth.,13

How the f-do you bowl here?",3
"entra ghoram ga dengutunnav ra Shreyas

I'm just cumming in a very straight way,2
"~~Keeping aside the chasing prowess of KKR for a minute, I think DC isnt going fast enough. Going by the recent scores at Sharjah they are about 1 or 1.5 RPO slower than what they should be going at.~~



Nevermind, they are doing just fine lol.",3
Shaw playing too slow. Mayank almost scored 100 in same balls,3
"Prediction- We’ll make 225, then Rabada will get 3 overs in powerplay. KKR 45 in 6 overs. RRR of 13 will get to them. Ethical boy will use his loads of experience to choke them",1
At least make the pitch more bowler friendly to balance out the small boundaries,2
I'm relieved that tuktuk Iyer is beginning to get his act together in favorable conditions,1
"Hetmeyer looks sad and distracted, hope he's okay",2
Iyer has zero respect for spinners,9

I’m struggling to remember the last time a bowler did well after commentators praising them before the over,1
yo this is kinda disrespectful I feel like I shouldn’t be watching this,1
The chin masks are getting on my nerves...,3
Everyone's going to feel like they're in form after a match here,4
Way to go DC. 2 15+ overs,1

Is DK crying,3
Lovely,2
This ground should come with a therapist for the ballers,3
"You have to feel for the bowlers because they can't do anything here. Just hope Russell, Narine, Morgan take revenge.",9

"bowling all the bowlers Shaw hammered in the nets when he was an u19 God

not a good tactic",6
"🎵It's raining runs, hellelujah it's raining runs oh oh🎵",4
Shaw has listened to too much Sunny G commentary and wouldn't even go after a bad ball after hitting a six,2
DK's expression. He is gonna kill somebody tonight!,7
Dugout's Wicket Alert results in a six once again.,10
Poor Shaw playing at 165 SR but still could do more.... Symptoms of Sharjah LOL,6
Who's the lady in the delhi capitals tshirt in the stands?,1
Take a shot everytime someone says 'Sharjah',7
"Don't want to be that guy, but this is anti csk.",2
My opinion : Morgan should come at 4. Dk should come after him.,5
wasnt shaw nagarkoti's u19 captain?,3
"Even though it's raining boundaries , I don't feel entertained . atleast leave some grass on the pitch",4

Tomorrow is gonna be exciting again.,2
He landed on his feet. That’s 10/10 in my book,4
bois our no. 4 and no. 5 is on the crease,4
"RRRRishabh Pant is right up there with Valthaty, Rahul Sharma, Sran or Bisla. He isnt just a t20 legend but a decent enough part time wicketkeeper, who can bat. He carried the whole ICL team after Rayudu left. What sets him apart from other players is he absolutely demolishes the batting attack. There is no rhythm to his destruction, he dosent care about being stylish or tries to go out of his ways. He plays by his strengths and that's what's allowed him to play for so long. Another thing that I genuinely like about him is how he enjoys the game. It dosent matter if he wins or loses, he's always smiling, dancing and makes you realise at the end of it the sport is just about enjoying yourself and being in the moment, fuck catches or stumpings! I genuinely thought he was done for after he was axed by the Sidemen but he's still going strong. It's a shame he isnt playing in the 100. No matter his form, he is one of the biggest crowd attractions and genuinely one of the most meatloaf evoking players on the planet.",-1
I love the running between the wickets of this generation Indian cricketers. Even Brohit who's visibly not fit is a pretty good runner.,3
Pant = Thiccccc,2

They are so athletic.
And rohit makes up for everything with the bat already",2

Hetmyer > Stoinis,1
Imagine a finals in Sharjah bruh,3
Cummo to get a 50(17)... will take Ashwin to the pound-town,4
He dosent even look much tired,2
This isn't a time to bowl A spinner even with a new batsman,2
[deleted],2
"""Iyer struggles against quality pace""

bsDK- ""okay... Chakravarty aaja 19th daal""",5
Iyer is going for the crown,1
I swear if DK promotes himself ahead of Morgan and Russell,5
"Idk how you bowl spinners on this pitch in the 19th over. Even Narine, Rashid would be hit all over the pitch",5
Shreyas with his big dick powet,3
"Russel must have told I'm good anything less than 250.

DK:Yes",4
Can Iyer get a 100?,2
Are they all just bowling shit or is Shreyas on absolute fire? Just tuned in and Cummins got absolutely smashed.,5
So DK is the captain who knew. BC jab KKR accha karti hia toh Morgan ko captain bolte hia .... dogale BC,1
Idc what the ground is. 230 is always a HUGE ask,3
Iyer century pls,3
"Go for big here Iyer, Stoinis can hit pace well",3
Someone activated the cheat code through the Cricket 07 welcome screen.,6
No disrespect to Karthik but I think captaincy should go to Morgan,11
"Karthik, you fucking donut, who bowls spin in the penultimate over?",17
Tewatia count: 1,5
Why no Hetmyer?,1
"The size of the ground is actually not the problem. It's the fucking flat pitch. Even wankhede is a small ground but atleast with the pitch, the bowlers have a chance.",5
Goddamn Shreyas 100?,5
Credit goes to DK,1
Iyer 100 on?,3
Stoin should take a single off the first ball next over,1
DK is such a good captain for DC,17
Don’t blame Varun here lmao,10
Fuck Iyer really murders the spinners.,12
"6 on any ground again.... this kind of hitting isn't on ground, this is all Iyer.",5
What's the point of bowling on this ground?,3
Didn't DK have other option than Mithun?,2
This is hardcore hitting which would do even on the longer boundaries of Abu Dhabi. Some of Iyer's shot have been incredible.,1
I think this ground is eventually gonna beat RCB’s highest score of 263 soon,1
"Looking at 240 maybe, that would be a ridiculous chase",1
88 (38) better than the Raina inning?,-1
Iyer is a beast,2
Nortje and Rabada are basically goats,2
Stoinis give strike to Iyer asap the next over,2
Can we sack Karthik already?,5
Lmao I was getting downvoted for saying 240 is possible,2
Such a horrible captaincy. What did you think will happen if you gave a spinner the 19th over?,2
may as well get a bowling machine to do the last over at this point,1
Whoever selected Vijay/Rayadu for number 4 spot over Iyer for the WC 2019 needs to be fired honestly.,4
lol that was wide Stoinis,1
Hit a ball going for wide and gets out 🤦‍♂️,1
Fanally some of that phat boi hetty,2
Sharjah reminding of EA Sports Cricket 07.,8
Jeez. DK must be cursing himself now,6
I feel like anything can be chase,4
"Atleast Nagarkotti can try yorkers which won't go for sixes, dumbass captaincy",3
"Morgan needs to Captain, DK is going nuts.",1
[deleted],5
I hope they crossed,3
That is so sexy shreyas...,3
What an idiot 😂,2
anything less than 240 I would consider a moral victory 🥶,15
Lmfao,5
I won't count Shreyas as a good T20 player unless he scores a 50 on a bigger ground with 125-130 SR.,6
What a soft dismissal,7
Russell has to do everything for kkr,8
"Stoinis, you donut, that was a wide",4
what an idiot nvm,0
Wtf stoinis why hit that,2
Why the fuck would you play that ball stoinis?,1
"Morgan is one of the best LOI captains in the world, possibly ever

And he’s not captain here",7
"You downvote, your mom fat

You upvote, your mom hot",-9
did they crossed,1
So many missed fifties,2
Center fresh award of the match goes to DK,2
Stoinis is not a finisher! Delhi need to open with him or drop him. It is as simple as that.,-1
That's one way to get out.,2
Marcus wasted a wide ball 😒,3
Stoinis being a proper tool here,3
That is classic Stoinis,3
Stonis came early here.,1
Russell gotta start loading up on them steroids if KKR want to win today,3
"**19.1** Russell to Stoinis, OUT, slower ball, wide down leg, but Stoinis thinks he can clear short midwicket and take four. However, he ends up toe-ending this for a catch at short fine leg **221-4**

MP Stoinis c Varun b Russell 1 (3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33",1
Stoinis walking away with the lowest strike rate of this innings. Just like we all predicted,3
CSK didn't even try and almost chased 216.,12
"
I cannot wait to see CSK's next game in Sharjah, they are gonna hit for 250 😂😂😂 Maybe even that 263 record can get broken",4
"Kartik should be dropped from captaincy , you can see the body language from the players they already gave up and no one wants to pull back things to a manageable level..",2
Russell should open who cares now,5
Specialist sometimes catcher Hetmyer is here.,2
Russell walks off like it was all a part of his plan,5
It was a wide FFS,2
Massive respect to Mishra for that mop he is wearing as a hairpiece,2
"Not only did he get out, he also played a wide ball!!",3
Always wanted a small ground like Eden Park of NZ for IPL to spice 60+ games. Thanks Sharjah 😊,4
Man looks like 240 is out.,0
Man they ruining my man iyer's hundred.,2
Stoinis wanted that to be fine for a 4. Can't blame him to be ambitious with massacre he has seen today,2
Iyer century on the cards.,1
Dot ball >> wicket here,2
fuck it open with dreruss & cum dog,3
So much for Iyer’s hundred,5
Great start to the last over,2
Wasting balls 🤦‍♂️,3
"Stoinis got out cheap? So wha? Have you seen those pecs?

~ Warne, probably.",7
Iyer isn't getting a century sadly,2
Would have been a wide he had left it alone. Daft play.,2
DOT FOR WOT,1
ok 3 more sixes is more good to me than Iyer century,1
Somebody tell Dinesh Karthik that he left Delhi Daredevils in 2014,3
Hetmyer > Stoinis anyday,1
Plz give strike to Iyer,4
[removed],19
what's the highest IPL score? Across all the editions,1
Hetmayer robbed a century of his captain,9
I reallyyy want to see a CSK chase here,1
Don't think Iyer can make it to 100 now,2
Why can’t the fucker give him strike ..,4
"Man, Shaw really didn't age well",15
The spider camera truly shows the ridiculousness that is this ground,3
Umpiring is shite.,3
Shreyas “robbed” Iyer,21
"Hetmyer has the Ass, every girl wants",12
RIP Iyer 100,8
Prithvi Shaw's expression be like this the best shit I have ever seen,8
That’s out lol,2
"Hi I'm Captaincy, what is a Dinesh Karthtik",9
BC hagg diya last over me,3
Cuntmyer,0
"Wasn't a wide. Stop asking for it, Simran.",9
We are getting mowed.,4
Russel as a bowler is underrated,6
What a shitty last over lmao,3
Russell surely reduced the target by atleast 10 runs,8
This is some God level final over from dre russ,10
Just feeling bad for Iyer,14
Hetmyer is    t h i c c,2
"Don't appeal for Agent Hetmeyer KKR, FFS",3
Iyer should have taken the run,5
Hetmyer shit the bed!,7
Fuckin Hetmyer and Stoinis spoiled Iyer's 100,17
Iyer deserved a century today,7
shaw looks 40wtf,11
3 dots in last over is criminal in Sharjah.,15
"Don't care if it is out, Russell saving our ass!",3
"Fuck Hetmyr wasting balls, nice death bowling Russel",3
"With Rabada defending this, 227 looks like one too many.",8
Sad for Iyer.,8
"77 sixes in 2.5 innings, absolutely tiny ground",4
DK - why? No point taking a review now. You are already slow in the over rate,4
Leeds v Man City in 30 min. Should be a cracker and a half,0
Bhag simran bhag,3
"6 runs off the last over, Lord Russell keeping it in his range",3
Simran ne hag diya.,7
Calling Dre Russ big hundred,1
DK looks a bit like actor Dhanush.,2
"Instead of wildly slogging, he could’ve given strike to Iyer. Poor from Stoin",3
This is what happens when a pacers bowls in the death!,0
Why don't they just move to ultra edge straight away ffs,4
Russel single handedly stopped Iyer from getting a 100,5
"You downvote, you have cum sock

You upvote, you have some cock",6
Wickets are so important in this match! DC needs wickets.,2
"Umpire should bitch slap hetymer for asking for wide.

Bowlers lives matter man.",9
Was it DK who went for the review?,5
What was that wierd sound ?,4
Dreruss somehow being astonishingly economical,4
Russell reenforcing that Rabada will be hard to score against too.,5
Seems like Dre Russ is on a different pitch than the other bowlers,5
Wtf! They checked it wrong.,3
The only thing DK must have heard were the talks of his resignation as captain,9
What an asinine review. Penalize this shit ffs,7
"**Iyer-Pant Partnership**

72 runs

5.1 overs

Run rate: 13.95

Dot balls:1 (Pant's Wicket)",62
That looked like a completely different ball when they showed that ultra edge,8
God level final over from russel,7
[removed],7
Sikee over,2
Retards,2
The ball looks like it's going through the bat like a glitch in a game.,3
Just go to ultraedge. Why waste time.,6
Numb ultimate over for the likes of Sharjah,3
Give 15 crores to Dre Russ!,11
Lowkey amazing over by Russell,3
Such a klpd this last over.,4
Nooooooo. Robbed him of his century.,4
Ffs DK keep an eye on the over rate. A t20 innings shouldn't take so long.,2
Fucked up finish for dc great comeback for kkr,3
"Brilliant last over, kept them in the game there",3
Fuck off shemron,3
Hetmyer is overrated similar to Corey Anderson,7
That last over left me so frustrated,6
A single too late from hetmeyer,3
"Man batting at 88 couldn't even get a chance to face a single delivery in last over, that's a crime and good stuff by kkr",12
Hetmyer 7(5). Remember this. Might prove to be a match defining inning.,6
Hetmyer might have costed DC the match.,8
now takes the single lol what a cock block,6
what a let down in the end. Iyer deserved a 100,12
Excellent final over given how the runs have been flowing all innings,7
Who knew Stoinis will be the villian today,5
"Poor Iyer missed out on 💯, thanks to Hetmyr",10
What an awesome over Dre Russ 👏👏👏 Take a bow. Now explode on the DC bowlers.,6
They just took the review so it will be a dead ball and Iyer would not get the strike.,4
"If KKR lose this, DK should be blamed for his absolute shit captaincy.",8
...can someone explain why we needed ultra edge please?,1
Will we finally get to see Narine striking a few today,6
"With our bowling power, 228 should be defendable.",6
Russell is my captain today.  Already got 108 points off his bowling. Give me another 100 in batting :P,12
"Dre rus is a freak!!

What a spell of 4 overs.",6
Should have got to 240. Still in the balance with the batting kkr have,3
"While we wait for the match to resume, here's a reminder that even the Capitals' owner has no fucking clue what their name means:

https://mobile.twitter.com/ESPNcricinfo/status/1070286062105387008",8
Why would you send Stoinis when you have Hetmayer in this situation? Easily wasted 15 runs.,5
"Whoever opens with Gill, better not eat up dot balls.",5
Umpires as useful as a cricket bat in a basketball game,7
"**Top-five scores conceded by KKR in an IPL innings**

**228/4 vs DC, Sharjah, 2020**

213/4 vs RCB Kolkata, 2019

210/6 vs MI, Kolkata, 2018",6
russell is both kkrs best bowler and batsman,9
"halfway through this innings r/cricket :- ffs iyer hit out or get out

r/cricket now:- fuck hetmeyer and stoinis for not giving iyer strike",41
Russ has done it with the ball. I hope he does it with the bat too.,3
DK getting all the r/cricket hate today...we know what that means,14
open with narine and cummins with russell at 3,11
Pant-Iyer are my favourite power couple,18
Why does the IPL have such a shit overlay. I want to know what score the batsman are on and how well the bowlers are doing.,4
If delhi somehow  loses this its because of thid last over,3
We lost this match in that last over. Damn DC's lower order batsmen lack braincells. Fuck this shit.,1
"No way KKR chase this with Rabada, Nortje, Ashwin, Mishra. Even Harshal Patel was good in domestic season from what I heard.",5
Dude's batting on 88 at over 200 and you give him a total of zero balls in the final over. Could easily have gotten to 240 if stoinis just ticked it over,6
"yea, i dont see kkr chasing this down.",1
"hahah in the 90s, 230 was a proper defendable 50 over score",8
that economy andre,1
[deleted],2
[removed],5
haha Iyer go brrrr,2
anything is gettable on this road,2
"KKR kinda pulled them back there 228 is way better than 240, psychologically at least especially considering Rajasthan chased down 221 with basically an over to spare after Tewatia’s slow start.",1
"Dubai : Bowler lives matter.

Sharjah : Batsmen lives matter.",10
Hetmyer is in the team for glamour... to show that thicc ass and get people watching the game.,7
"Lara - ""Batsmen not having time to cross over during the catch is a good thing because Hetmyer is coming to the crease""

3 balls later - ""3 dot balls - they could've done better with their captain on 88 at the crease"".",7
"KKR should open with Cumdog and dre russ. Cummo stands at the non-strikers and gives a trademark grin and wink, bowlers lose focus and bowl dollies, dre russ cunts. ggez",9
"Take a bow, Andre Russell. 2-29 in 4 overs, it's a good performance on ANY ground, forget about Sharjah!",10
Should've been 235+ smh,10
"fucking 229 is being put up as a target and I feel it's a tossup, what the fuck is this ground. How is it the same sharjah that we have fond memories of sachin blowing Warne out of the park?",15
"That was a champion over! Good job, Dre Russ!",6
Id rather have Rahane then hetmyer at this point,14
228 but lower than I thought they would get. Still chase able,6
Russell 2 for 29 in 4 is godly on this ground,54
Pant and Iyer partnership had no dots which was the main reason for this score. All other partnerships had dots galore.,7
Dk should get fined for slow over rates. He did the same in MI's match as well.,3
inb4 Ethical mind mankades tf out of KKR,2
Whats the highest first innings score so far this IPL?,3
Is this par score?,1
There's no reason for Delhi to not drop Hetmyer for Carey.,6
I want to go to DC's dressing room and hear what Ponting has to say. I adore him as a coach.,3
Mumbai has by far the worst T20 team name in all the world,10
"Ghanta game in balance. If DC lose this, I will be mad!",6
"**DC/DD never lost match, after scoring 200+ in IPL**

Won - 5

Lost - 0

*But it's 2020*",20
When your team score 228 but you're still afraid they'll lose because Sharjah.,15
"RR scored 226 with 3 balls left. Not saying KKR is gonna win for sure.
But, not as tough as it looks.",10
Time to get Carey in for Hetmyer,4
"This is madness. This is insane.


THIS IS SHAAARJAH...",4
"KKR missed a trick by not taking Ferguson in place of narine I feel... hopefully Narine can justify his place with good start, but I swear if Morgan bats at 6 today also DK should be sacked from captaincy",11
"Why did braindead BsDK choose to bowl first in this ground, especially as the pitch is just gonna get slower.
Retarded captaincy.",6
Dre Russ bowled out his skin for 2-29 in a T20 when all the other bowlers got carted at 11+ an over,35
It’s an opportunity for us to really bump the NRR.,2
Oh god DK is terrible with his reviews.,0
"Can KKR break chase record of RR today, statistically they have enough firepower but DC have likes of Rabada, Norje to keep this interesting",5
15-20 short I reckon,5
"Rabada: Just woke up! What do we have to work with?

Iyer: 228, but remember a weaker Rajasthan batting chased down a similar total on this same grou...

Rabada: Stfu, and gimme the ball!",12
I wanna see the way ashwin balls here. He is a peetty smart cricketer and i hope he has his plans,4
"**Good bowling by Andre Russell**

1-0-4-0 = 4

2-0-7-0 = 3

3-0-22-1 = 15/1

4-0-29-2 = 7/1

**22/2 in death overs (18th & 20th)**",8
If only Hetmyer could have given strike to Iyer with a single run.,3
Lappebaaz hetmyer should be replaced with Carey next game,5
"T20 doesn't need such small boundaries to give an exciting game, such a nightmare for bowlers and disgrace for the game.",3
At this rate RCB will give away  300 runs on this ground.,10
Why is everyone so sure about a DC win? This is Sharjah ffs.,6
"Is KKR manages to chase down this record over,then things gonna get spicy ^_^",7
ELI5 why spin bowling is easy to hit in death and hard in the mid overs?,13
is narine gonna open now?,2
KKR needs the one and only Yusuf Pathan to chase this down.,7
Russell at 1 down after Rabada’s gotten in 2 overs?,7
Excellent bowling by Russ. Wtf was that. The score could've easily been 250,6
Feeling sad for Shreyas my man could easily score 100 if he played the last over,8
I think this score is equivalent to 180. Should be a good chase to watch.,4
"Shaw and Iyer are quality players, but maybe for once we need to stop appreciating batsman on such small grounds.",12
Mishi & Ash are going for 100+ combined.,2
Highest first innings total at this venue and yet people are saying DC scored 15-20 less. Lalach ki bhi seema hoti hia,6
240 got robbed,1
"If we get Narine early and then Russel for cheap, we bag this for sure.",2
"Wasn't watching the match, but just realized Kuldeep isn't even playing. Shame to see his confidence is wrecked, I thought he'd walk into the India LOI teams for a while a couple of years ago.",6

wtf why they still talking about CSK -_-,5
Feels like we are gonna lose by more than 100 runs.,9
"I hope Bhuvi is fit tomorrow, if not I'm kissing our tournament goodbye.",18
"In Jacques Kallis over optimistic word, ""Guys, I think we've done a good job, I think they're 15 runs short"".",30
KKR should be able to chase this down. Delhi were 10/15 runs short in the initial 10 overs.,5
"DK should not mess with batting order by promoting himself and must send Morgan at 4, Russel at 5 and himself at 6",11
Russel + Sharjah = 💀,7
[deleted],10
"Rabadas gonna come out and teach a crash course on how to bowl at Sharjah
Ashwins a good tactician too, hard to outwit him when they have so many runs to defend",6
This gon be a slobberknocker,1
"If Mishra and Ashwin bowl well, it's gonna be DC all the way. No way Rabada is gonna leak runs considering his form of late.",2
Hetty should bat above Pant.,1
Fuck it next game at Sharjah just play Banton instead of Narine  and get Rana to bowl 4 overs . Everyone will get carted anyway .,11
Boundaries in Sharjah are shorter than Chinnaswamy?,5
"No way KKR is winning this lol 

With the kind of bowling DC has its GG",8
23 dot balls in the DC innings and 11 was bowled by Andre Russell (4 in last over) Today he bowled 4 overs & he figures were 4-0-29-2,8
tmrw csk game woah pretty sure they're losing again,3
Don't use /s. It kills sarcasm. I have been guilty of using it too,12
"Gill, Narine, Russel, Morgan, Rana/DK",1
Russell will probably get an Afridi-esque 0(1),10
No of sixes so far?,2
I believe in Ashwin to dismiss Morgan cheaply here,3
Russell should open and get KKR to 130/0 after powerplay,8
Russell already won the match with the ball I'm afraid.,11
Russell will score 220 and rest will score 9,7
mishra going for 60 methinks,2
Ashwin tally for tonight?? 50+ runs i think,2
[removed],8
Ponting giving advice to Ashwin. Must be about Ethics,5
Why is Boria Mazumdar so great? 🤣🤣🤣,5
Excited to see how Shubhman adapts his game here.,3
Oh for fucks sake there comes Narine,2
Surely the last chance for Narine to do something at the top.,2
OH GOD WHY WHY NARINE WHEN YOU'VE PICKED TRIPATHI,0
In B4 Ashwin mankades Russel,2
WTF. Narine again?????,1
"Narine opening wouldn't be too bad of an idea here. If he fires, then great, if not just let someone else come in.",1
"1% chance 99% faith

Let's do it",2
"Imagine Umesh, Steyn and Siraj bowling in Sharjah",1
"The boundary size is laughworthy.

Who knows ,We may even see DK's greatest performance after that Nidahas match.",2
"Ponting: Ashwin, remember I said don't mankad?

Ashwin: Yes, I will try not to

Ponting: Just wanted to say, forget about it. Go wild",4
"All of you complaining about Narine, this is the type of ground and pitch where he'll be useful.",1
"Man I feel so bad on Rahane, he’s useless on Delhi. Idk why a team who actually needed him like RR sold him",9
This HAS to be the last Match for narine to prove himself before he gets benched,5
Won't mind even if Gill goes for a duck. He's too classy for Sharjah,8
jinx is in for?,4
Please be close and not a stomp,1
Haha Ashwin gave the pep talk in the huddle. Not Iyer,6
Today you guys will learn once again why Rabada is the true OP fast bowler.,1
Are SG bats named after Shubhman Gill?,1
"Narines batting isn't suited for Abu Dhabi or Dubai, those are grounds where you need proper batsmen. 

On this ground and pitch, Narine type players are exactly what you need.",2
"Does this mean Morgan and DreRus would bat after Rana, DK, Tripathi?",1
Lol what if Russell gets mankaded,4
Match will pretty much get decided in the powerplay.,1
Just seen your dad complaining about high scoring games,5
Who is getting Narine out?,1
Rabada's 4 overs are gonna be very crucial.,1
Gill opens  with 2 beautiful dots,1
McCullum and Ponting preparing for UPSC exams? So much writing!,8
Baz be like fuck it imma come out and bat now.,4
Please send Russell and Morgan before DK tonight,3
Subhuman needs to get going right away,5
What do these guys write so vigorously,8
KKR has started to play for the NRR from the first ball itself 😂😂,3
God bless KKR's nrr,2
"I am really relaxed , My team won today and can watch neutrally",4
"With Rabada, Nortje, Ashwin and Mishra ji, no way KKR gonna chase this down",2
Quite disappointed tripathi didn't start,1
22 matches 38 wickets? Rabada is crazy.,2
Tbh there aren't many match winners (allrounders) except hardik and Russell. Agree with Aakash but he shouldn't have pin pointed a player. Or say unequivocally to indian players too? Provided his own Mumbai bias and he suck at his own job of commentating. Neesham's average player no doubt but yes it can hurt a player still!!!,-1
Does DK realise Rabada and Nortje bowl at 145+? Narine won't be able to cunt them out of the ground.,3
narine wicket is just a formality.,2
i so badly want kkr to chase this down to just make 200+ chasing in this ground is a norm.,3
Anyone notice that the TV angle is weirdly low in Sharjah? Is it because of the small ground?,8
Damn Rabada you’re so good tf,1
DC and KKR coaches taking notes better than I did during my school.,11
Rabada is too good. Save an over for the middle when Russel comes to the crease and 2 for the death,5
Whenever people write DC I have to remind myself Dehli Capitals not Deccan Chargers,8
What a ball that was!,2
Justice for Tripathi,3
I am starting hate Narine because of DK.,5
Narine looks like a genuine tailender again.,2
-,1
Man SA produces such good bowlers,4
"All this talk around Morgan and Russell, I'm calling Rana will be KKR's top scorer tonight.",11
Narine needs to hit or get out.,3
CMV:SG bats are named after shubman gill,7
Can DC defend this?,2
"Okay. So 229 in 16 overs, it seems.",7
Can Narine do a Tewatia?,1
How did that not go for four,4
If you have played Tripathi then why open with Narine,8
Lol RR realesed Tripathi because he could bat only at the top. KKR dumb,11
"Suddenly ground looks so big, he was chasing the ball for quite some time.",7
Really hope DK fucks it up by sending Tripathi at 3.,14
Banton would've scored 18(3) by now,15
Ashwin to bowl next,4
[deleted],11
Narine tapping the ball for single. What more do I have to see in this IPL??!! FFS,10
This ground is shit,3
"*Rahane kya halat bana di hai re teri. Aaja mere bhai, MI main wapas aaja*",7
The background noise is getting a bit much. Can't hear the commentators properly.,3
"Gambhir used Narine as opener against teams with ordinary opening bowlers, he didn’t throw him in there against the Rabadas of the world.

KKR really need to think about their opening combination, Narine isn’t equipped to face Rabada-Nortje",25
pant with his highest jump as a wk,4
Ashwin's jersey number looks like the 9999999 in 1 video game cassettes that were sold in the 90s,3
Shaw out is great for Delhi. Stoinis moves to top and we have a stronger team.,-3
Brilliant,1
Holy Shit  Nokia looks young af after he shaved,4
Maybe leave Rabada for the first over and whack the others,1
PURE PACE ON DISPLAY LETSS GOOOOO,3
Prithvi Shaw is such a fragile cricketer,3
At least Narine didn't waste balls here. Poor guy,8
Lol .... tail ender gonna bat like tail ender.,5

For CSK - Faf Du plessis (72)

For KKR - J Kallis (72)",8
That's it. Narine should be benched,10
lol narine. saw it coming from miles away.,3
Nortje you beauty,4
Save Rabada’s 3,2
Narine looks clueless and still they keep sending him up...I hope today's the end of narine and DK captaincy,9
"**1.3** Nortje to Narine, OUT,  **8-1**

SP Narine  b Nortje 3 (6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50.00",1
Gaya nakli opener,13
Russell at 3 or we riot,8
ABRA KA DABRA Anrich Nortje,5
[deleted],11
Clipped beautifully,1
What's the score? Looks like my stream is lagging. FML.,5
That's it. Experiment over. Fucking end it now,3
Sunil Narine struggling as batsman,2
DC got that mandatory free wicket,6
*Acts surprised*,6
Narine is finished as an opening batsman. Every team has a very good fast bowler and his technique will get exposed 10/10 times. End this already. Painful to watch.,8
Lol just stop sending Fuckin Sunil Narine to open,6
"Why are bowlers so pumped after getting Narine out?
Last day Unadkut, today Nokia",5
"Stick to cunting people in CPL!!

IPL has figured Narine out.",8
Good that he's out in the 2nd over.,3
Without his porn mustache nokia looks hott,3
why do bowlers get so overexcited agter getting a  tailender out!!,3
Nortje celebrating as if he's picked Russel looool. Fucking love the pace at which he bowls.,5
Narine should be totally benched.,2
Should send Rana next,1
Now send the opening batsmen of kkr,4
top of the stump 💥,2
"Damn Nortje's celebration is really wild, suits him tbh",6
"Lol, Nokia celebrating like he took the wicket of Kohli or something",2
Narine hasn't been able to fire. Tripathi died for this,1
"All the Indian bois look so tiny standing next to Stonis, Nortje and Rabada",4
"At this rate, Rana might as well be called an opening batsman",9
"I’m tired of Narine opening. It was a fun gimmick at first, but now we’re just throwing away a wicket at the beginning of every innings. He’s been figured out - move him down the order.",4
Good atleast didn't tuk tuk.,1
"Nobody : 

**Foreign player appears on TV**

My Dad : Which country is he from?",14
"All of us are arm chair experts here, and we all know that but is there anybody here who still wants to see Narine opening?",1
"Another bowler celebrates the dismissal of Narine as if he's won the world cup. Mate we are glad he's out. Thanks, and chill a bit",10
Bring in dre russ,1
Open with Russell!,1
KKR needs to lose for them to drop Narine down the order,1
I think DK has forgotten that Narine is primarily a bowler. His batting is just a bonus.,2
The greatest trick Naraine ever pulled was convincing KKR that he is a opener.,22
What a pose feom Narine,1
"How is it that what we can see sat on our couch, international captains like DK miss....",1
Picks a specialist opener still opens with Narine. KKR management.,6
Send in Tripathi!,1
Why is Curran not coming up the order and why is Narine at top of the order. WE WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THIS.,3
Nortje seems like he's from Iceland,2
"Any regular opener would get 10 on 6 balls and most importantly, build an innings. Pinch Hitting tactic is so overrated.",3
What will it take for our management to stop opening with Narine?,2
How many times is KKR gonna try the Naraine opening experiment before they realize that teams have figured his game out? Even India realized this when there was a span where Irfan Pathan would open that shit like this works once in a blue moon not every game.,8
These Josh ads are so cringe,5
Should have played Tom Banton instead of Narine.,5
[Game on](https://i.imgur.com/zkC4KmJ.jpg),3
Bring Tom banton into the team,2
"The way Narine's been going, does it even benefit us getting him out?",3
Why is Tripathi playing if he isn't opening?,4
"who are the replacements for narine? not the best bowling or batting form, and misfielded a bunch too.",5
When will this shitty plan be dropped? Its dead mate,3
"People salty at Nortje's celebration, getting someone bowl'd early is always satisfying",6
Tom banton should've played in this ground,5
[deleted],6
This Narine guy just can’t cut it,3
"DK is a shit captain.

Anyone following KKR can see this coming from a mile, yet, we open with Narine.",4
Narine might be next out from the team after Kuldeep,2
Isn't Tom Banton in the squad? Get him to open please,10
"Dear KKR management,
Narine is a half-decent pinch-hitter at best. Not an opening batsman. 

But you should've figured that out two seasons ago.",5
KKR have already lost a wicket,1
Sunil *please don't bowl fast to me* Narine,4
Gay Gay R.. it's time for me to switch to Rcb,0
Jeez narine has no business opening the batting for KKR,1
Nokia reliving the glory of good ol' Symbian days.,2
Narine KKR's management need to understand that Narine ain't gonna score 18 ball 50 this season. Get over with this experiment. Not to mention he's not that effective with the ball either.,4
Rana was so good when he played for mi,3
so why is Narine part of the team again!? it's time they let him go.. he cannot be Pollard..KKR are emotionally attached to Narine..,2
"Probably its end of the run for Narine, atleast for some games. 

Bring on Tom Banton",3
Why not Narine at 7 or 8?,1
Never understood why Narine opens for KKR even till this day.,1
Big brain move from KKR to continue sticking with Narine even though it's the same result every single time,8
Lmao did they just run 3?,4
Wait Tripathi is playing today?,5
how likely is it that KKR pulls off this run chase?,2
"Guys, if it is is a no ball but the ball hits the stumps and goes away for a boundary, is it a boundary?",6
Suddenly the ground seems big,4
Is this a different outfield or something?,0
Why tf RR keeps playing Robi Uthappa?!!!,8
Banton 100% should be a starter at Sharjah,5
"They have Siddhesh Lad, Tripathi, Banton...yet Narine is opener",4
3 at Sharjah. Thats an insult to the fielder lol,51
Running a 3 in Sharjah *clap*,13
Just saw Prithvi Shaw on the screen... He looks like a middle aged uncle and a kid at the same time!,8
"Oh well, good game KKR. These runs were too much for you anyway. 

KKR is better suited to playing at Dubai and Abu Dhabi",5
"KKR doing the impossible. Taking 2's in Sharjah.

Edit: 3's",18
Waiting for Gill to fuck it up at a low SR and people will call for his head too like Narine. 3 off 5 is nothing in the context of the game,0
Honestly covid figure jokes aside I'm really worried that this lack of discipline and getting fat will lead to a lot of injuries and probably cut short a lot of promising careers,7
"Why the fuck do they open with Narine, can someone tell me? I know he can hit but you need a solid opening partnership chasing 229 don't you think?",8
"If that was Ponting, that was a run out. Dude was an amazing fielder!",9
"Narine experiment was started by Gambhir 2 seasons ago, DK has failed to be innovative by not opting to play a proper opener and end this Narine experiment.",14
[deleted],8
Karthik is seriously a bad captain. He used Gill at No. 5/6 for 2 years before figuring out he is an opener. Now he is playing all the right players but batting them out of order (except Gill). I won't be surprised if he doesn't use Narine as opener against only team if he will be successful against i.e. RCB,7
"Narines job is to swing the bat and try to get a start if he gets out no big deal ,we can see off best bowlers in the initial overs.",2
12 FOR ONE LMAO,5
[deleted],8
scared for Ash yaar.. go good baby,2
My Ethical boi,3
Mankad incoming!!!,1
Oh Ashwin yes,1
over/under on a runout at bowler's end?,1
Noooo Pant has started piping up from behind the stumps again time to mute,1
Ethical daddy,1
Why not send someone who can hit the ball in the air with conviction and exploit the powerplay restrictions,2
[deleted],3
Come on Gill. Rooting for you. Need to show up when odds are against.,3
"Ashwin ji aagaya, non strikers beware",7
Mankad please,7
"I can hear it again and again but i will never be okay with pant calling ashwin as 'Ash'
He is your senior.",0
"Really excited to see how Gill approaches the chase here. He can't afford to play the anchor, should keep striking consistently at 150 SR at least.",6
Pant shouting Come on Ash brings back so many memories,9
Gentle reminder that Narine is 2x Player of the Tournament.,10
KKR girl,5
 Welcome back Ashwin... With that 6,3
The non striker is more afraid than the batsman,4
Sharjah is not very ethical I'm afraid,11
[deleted],6
Will the real opening batsman please stand up,6
Narine is absolutely useless isn’t he,8
That's how you show intent,3
sent that back to abu dhabi,3
KKR can be comical sometimes.,5
[deleted],5
Non Striker starting well within his crease,6
Mankad in 3... 2... 1,6
DK all padded up. Please don't get out. Please bat till the 8th over so that they send Russell,5
"Yeah, Ashwin is going to get destroyed looks like",3
mankad alert kek,6
This is one of the games where you can bowl 4 overs from your fifth bowler starting from the 14th over if you can ensure the match is finished by the 13th (like bowl Rabada or Nortje out by then) . No one does that though lol.,3
Ashwin getting battered and/or shredded makes me feel warm in side.,-2
Twat was a beauty.,2
Nokia bowls well,2
Am I too optimistic if I'm thinking rabada already has bowled 25% of his quota just to get narine..,9
Prithvi Shaw looks like a child molester and a child molested at the same time **,12
I love Ashwin lmao. He's like a reddit shitposter turned cricketer.,12
Sharjah makes Trent Bridge look normal,4
The way Ashwin is being treated isn’t very ethical is it?,5
This ground is a nightmare for offies.,3
3-digit shirt numbers look so stupid,9
"Is stopping in the delivery stride legal?
If yes, it is ethical?
Looks a bit fishy to me.",10
Shaw looks like that perv uncle at the family functions who keeps trying to 'hug' your sister,24
Will be interesting to see Gills approach here,3
RCB have done very well but also probably lucky to not have played a single match at Sharjah so far.,3
"I am a big Gill fan but if he backs up, run him out without warning. No favourites when its time to abolish the batriarchy.",6
"Why the fuck KKR management is persistenting with narine. Get a proper opener god dammit. It has worked once well, it's not working now move on!",5
Nitish Rana is awesome👍🏽👏🏽👏🏽,3
So it started,2
There could be a literal volcano on the pitch and the IPL camerapersons would still manage to find and focus on the two women in the crowd,7
Ashwin guy is too smart to get hit for 2-3 boundary's in a over unless he's bowling to brute force Russell.,9
DK madarchod take those pads off. Don't you fucking dare come in next,12
Hetty's carrying a baby here there's no way a professional athlete looks like that...,2
Ashwin literally stopped amidst  his delivery. Is that allowed?,7
Tbh if chatter by a keeper is designed to annoy the batsman Pant is objectively the best at it he's so good he even annoys spectators,8
I want to commit die,3
Fast bowlers are bowling well. Let’s bowl Ashwin lol,3
"Ashwin starts run up, stops , thinks why he returned in Sharjah, bowls, hit for six , regrets.",10
"Ashwin needs to turn the ball away first, if he wants to angle the ball in to get him LBW.",2
That pause is fucking annoying!,8
"Rana yaad kar, MI ke saath 2017 main khele huye woh pehle che matches yaad kar. 

T - Recall the good season he had with MI in 2017",7
Sharjah is heaven for batsman,4
what's the name of the song playing in the boat ad?,2
"KKR - I bowled a spinner in the 19th over...

DC - Hold my beer",7
Dhawan's role in the team is scoring 30-odd runs and telling Rahane it is okay to sit out of the team but come out for fielding,38
Don't hate it is hard for You tuber to play cricket,5
Yeah. You need to get Rana out.,3
Nortje is the best fast bowler in the world,3
Illegal ashwin,6
Ah man. The matches are 10x more entertaining with all of you. Thanks for being there in this covid times,27
Finally Gill takes off,2
How can we disguise Rabada into Harshal Patel so that he can bowl 8 overs?,16
Dugout said it’s a wicket over so it’s gonna be a >12 run over.,8
Ashwin pumps everyone up and then proceeds to getting thumped out of the ground.,6
KKR can do with a Narine-Kedar swap with CSK,5
Good shot by Sara's boyfriend.,5
That’s sheer class,3
Sharjah reminds me of the ground in NZ where they have the boundary behind what would be mid on at MCG or Eden Gardens,12
There will be 12 overs of spin and Stoinis's dilly dolly bowling. Those overs are going to define the match,5
DC chose two spinners for today's match despite having so many pace bowlers? Wtf?,3
I now feel Ashwin stops at every ball to see if there is a chance to Mankad,11
"Why gill uses red towel, while all other kkr players use purple towel?",6
"There is no way Karthik is going to send himself before Morgan once again, is he?",8
Bowl short to them. They aren't going to miss the full balls.,3
So what number is Dre going to come in at? Any guesses? I'm saying 4,6
KKR have Tom banton in the squad and keep playing narine as opener????,11
"If you are a bowler and your captain asks you to bowl the 19th over at Sharjah, does he believe in you or hate you?",20
If they want pinch hitter as opener might have as well send Cummins,9
"Butterfly effect: Iyer taking single on 18.6 -> not getting to bad in last over -> Dc 15 to 20 runs short -> Russel and KKR starting the innings with momentum -> KKR winning with good enough balls left and high NRR - > Qualifying for playoffs on the basis on NRR 

Lol",14
Gill is a class act.,4
DC’s fairplay points to see a bump after this match,3
Drop Narine for Banton. It’s a no brainer.,39
Beautiful,0
Sexy,3
Anyone else who thought Tripathi is gonna open today and picked him in your fantasy and are now screwed?,9
"What was that cross-bat shot, Gill!",6
[deleted],4
"imagine if nortje was a batsman, imagine the cringe of ""nokia ka connection"" everytime he hit a boundary",12
"Dho us Nokia ko, dho.

T - wash your Nokia phone.",3
Sometimes expert catcher Hetmyer has no chance there.,2
Hetmeyer's nickname was 'golu' in middle school,3
The way they talk about unacademy that they invented cricket,4
Really was good of the Sharjah u12s to loan there ground to the IPL.,8
Shubhman Gill is a world class batsman,4
tbh this would be an out in any other ground,2
Gambhir's biggest mistake in life after chipping it back to Dilshan is making Narine opener,6
"At the rate these Indian youngsters are playing international level T20, petition for the BCCI to send 2 teams to a T20 WC because I'm pretty sure India A can kick India's ass.",11
Just Sharjah things~ hehexd,0
Rohit and Shreyas Mutual funds👍🏽👍🏽,6
"Narine's wicket reminds me of jos's wicket against kxip this year, things really started when he got out",1
Insane how Banton isn’t being played in ~~Tesco Taunton~~ Sharjah,2
Hold off on calling batsman who score here good. It's an absolute shit ground,8
Who let Ashwin bowl in the powerplay,2
"2 proper batsmen in and suddenly KKR in the game, very surprising eh",2
We get Axar to field instead of Shaw. That’s cheating because Shaw is guaranteed catch drop a match.,8
Should Narine be dropped for Banton?,2
"Lisa: these days captains like to go in with extra fast bowling options for more flexibility.

*Laughs in KXIP*",2
Omg for the last time it's Nort-Jeh not Nokia.,-1
Did LIC approach KJo for their ads or what?,0
Big Stoin,3
Juicy over from stoinis I think,2
Can Stoinis do what Russell did with ball,2
"I saw the Tendulkar masterclass in '98 and even though he was in the opposing team, cheered a bit for him.

What has happened to this ground? Was it always this small?",11
I would say Narine is still a good bowler so don't drop him yet and just play Tripathi at top and Narine as a tailender.,4
Downvoter is a twat,6
Last year Russell destroyed Stoinis is both encounters.,5
Fuck this annoying wicket alert buzzer. Who thought this sound effect was a brilliant idea?,2
"Do you guys think it is stupid to have Narine open when you have Tripathi? Why do they think a technically superior opening batsmen can't score as fast as Narine? And if Narine is such a great slogger why not let him slog ""bonus runs"" in death?",8
Being a bowler in Sharjah during IPL is like getting a role in BR Chopra's Mahabharata but finding out you play Nakul/Sehdev lmao,5
I'm from Delhi but always want Gill to do well. Even when it's against DC. He's that good.,4
That batting deserves better commentators,7
Downvoter has issues,1
[deleted],3
"BC kyun short daal rahein ho pel raha hain toh.

Translation: why bowl short when he hits it well.",2
Is it Nort-Jey Nokier Nokia Norj tf is it,4
"Kinda unfair for Tripathi, but a bowler/AR in place of Tripathi & Banton in for Narine would make KKR look strong.",4
Axar Patel's waist is Stoinis's bicep.,21
Fuck you loser downvoter,4
"Focus on playing good cricket shots Gillman, don't overhit.",2
Narine may not be good enough to open but he's still a quality spinner if Kuldeep was in form them might have thought about dropping him but now looks really difficult,12
In a game like this to bring Russell in at 7 is a waste. Morgan and Russell need to be in at 4 and 5!,3
"DK is a shit captain, Narine is a shit batsman, can we move on please?",11
[deleted],7
Just gotta play 9 rpo till 14th over and let Russell take over.,3
Serial downvoters have small dick energy,4
Unacademy is surely to unlearn right?,1
I would like to see a mathematical model which adjusts bowler's figures for short boundary inflation,6
*What an over Stoinis. RRR goes stonks*,4
anjum chopra - have the pitches gotten flatter in the past few years? have you even been following cricket from the 2000s?,2
I don’t blame Pant to celebrate the dot,8
How good is Daniel sams as a bowler?,2
"Marcus ""pie chucker"" stoinis giving only 8 runs in an over at sharjah is illegal",1
"*Shows stats of eriksen in FIFA*
Rohit: ""ye dekh sare players ka stats""",4
Iyer let Ashwin bowl in the power play to make up for DK letting Chakravathy bowl in the death,3
Man I used to shit on Sanju Manju but now I'm stuck with Anjum Chopra's shit commentary 😑,9
Would be surprised if Rana manages to throw his wicket away by hitting it into deep in Sharjah too,1
ahhh.. our boy Harshal in the house..,1
Look I know Patel isn't special but I've always loved his bowling action,0
"Iyer, DK, KL all are average captains at best",6
Watch Narine get his form back against RCB,4
If we don't murder Patel and Stoinis dibbly dobblies I will riot,3
Don't @ me... Harshal looks psychotic.,1
[deleted],2
Harshal Patel is the imposter. Calling dibs,1
"Saying it now, Mishra 2 wickets over coming next",1
I thought it hit his pad.,1
Harshal Patel playing because of his experience getting fucked in Bangalore.,4
Harshal Patel looks like a cast member on Mirzapur,2
"3 stumps to hit, got to hit.",3
Tendulkar’s Desert Storm looking less and less impressive to the younger generation with every game in Sharjah... What’s the big deal about hitting 6s and 4s here they ask,8
Wtf..harshal bowls 135+?,1
Harshal Patel sus,2
"Even in chinnaswamy/Wankhede so many 210+ innings Weren't happening.

Who is that having unlimited meals? Nagarkotti?,9

Placed well by rana,1

Now these are the kind of runs that can only be scored because it's a powerplay.,3

Just here to see Gill & Rana score and DC winning the match 😍,4
"Shit, we need a break through",2
"To be fair , patel didn't bowl bad",10
IPL speed guns are as reliable as Sunil Narine a t20 opener.,5
Fuck he is turning it more than Ashwin!,8
"'Herschelle' Patel has RCB roots.

Bad use of power play. Needed 90,2
Imagine Gayle playing at Sharjah,8
Woke cricket fans: 10dulkar overrated desert storm. Look at stats. He is literally the Jimmy Anderson equivalent of batting.,3
"Banton seems to be the best option for opening in future but at least for today, Tripathi should have opened. You have got to feel for the guy. Did really well couple of years ago as an opener for RR but was forced into middle order which messed up his form. Now traded to KKR but got his chance only in their 4th game of the tournament and will most likely bat at 7. To add salt to his wounds, he will eventually be replaced by Kuldeep when Banton comes in for Narine.

He surely would have started every match as an opener had he been playing for CSK.  Ironically enough, Rahane who was partly responsible for pushing him into middle order is in the exact same position as him.",12
"KKR needs an aggressor like Shaw here,  both are scoring 10 a over but need more now itself to avoid pressure at the end ..",1
So Patel's variation is gonna be the quicker one,10
Someone's gonna tell Hetmyer that he has something on his hair?,7

Missed on a tosser.,2
"59 after 6 decent from DC, gotta take wickets of these 2. And yes don't forget ,take wickets of Morgan and Russell too",4
how much did kkr make in pp?,2
I can't believe harshal patel has only gone for 12 .,1
Shaw should insure his foot because it seems like the universe wants to break it,3
"I have to say a lot of folks doubting Sachin's Desert storm here. 

- Remodelling of the Stadium to increase seating at the expense of perimeter

- The pitch that would grip and ball-bounce would stay lower

- The match was an ODI 

- That T20Is were invented a Decade later.",22

Greame Swann is a real.joker,2
It's weird seeing Patrick Farhat not walking out in BCCI uniform,3

DC has to take 7 wickets to ensure they win this match. KKR sure bats deep,1
Mishraji should share some of that hair regrowth formula with Prithvi,1
This is why he is Mishra*ji*,5
I'm just waiting for Mishra's wig to get displaced lollll,1
It's weird seeing a spinner not getting absolutely cunted at Sharjah,4
Fuck Ashwin up,1

Who do you think has the biggest pee pee,1
Sed lyf amit mishra.. they are making fun of his catches in the dugout,4
Ashwin nowhere near mishraji,2
Mishraji slowed the whole game down. S tier over tbf,3
Smash it you have batting till 9,4
Rahane contributing negatively despite not playing. Impressive!,2
You can't look to settle down to chase such a high score,3
Can we start with the intent comments?,5
KKR is the new CSK,3
"Ash**WIN** 

DC winning confirmed.",1
Is KKR thinking about taking it deep^(TM) ?,1
RCB have been the Everton of the IPL so far (biggest surprise),3
Rana needs to blow up next over or let someone else do it,2
NRR game?,2

 Wait why is rahane fielding?,1
Why is Ishant Sharma not playing? Injury?,1
KKR need to unleash their big dick sixes.,1
KKR channeling their inner Dhoni,2
Ashwin's accuracy has been worse than a 14th century arquebus so far.,3
"If I had a body like Mishraji, I wouldn't mind using it too LSRK",4
Gill seems to be playing a bit conservatively.,2
Ashwin is good husbando material ngl,4

Tuk tuk Rana,2

"Why did KKR stack up all the fine looking players? Rana, Gill, DK, Morgan, Russell and Pat Cummins.",10
Send Russell next or no hope,1
Wow.... Altroz.... Whata a beauty with a great music system,4
Kkr batting is a reverse tewatia move,4
Not following closely. Does kkr have a chance?,6
Altria!,2
WTF is with Ashwin's squad number,3
Finally got a four,5
Ashwin just wasted all the effort of Mishraji,2
Holy shit they still have Rabada,6
Does Ashwin like turn the ball?,3
Kkr not batting fast enough here,2
How many ex-captains does DC have,7
Send the balls out of the boundary come on,3
That injury robbed Ashwin of his super saiyan powers that he earned through all those lockdown interviews.,12

Damn! Now it looks difficult for KKR guys :(,2
Amit Mishra's wig the difference?,3
Nitish Rana is to KKR what Rayudu is to CSK and Suryakumar is to MI. Can play the anchor role perfectly well and can change gears and go for the kill when needed.,8
RRR over 13. Surely Russell should come next,1

The Big Man is in the house!,5
On flat pitches Shaw > Gill. Lmao Shaw gonna play too much ODIs and T20 for India's home season doesn't he? 😂,6
Gill should've just rotated the strike and let Rana hit,8
shaw 1- gill 0,-3
"Gill has generally done good in easy chases, this was a hard chase, required him to up his game.",1
Mishra ji is a fucking legend. I thought he would retire 5 years ago. Now I am sure he will still be playing 5 years later.  An alpha leg spinner who still flights the ball unlike the beta Rashid quick-arm-action Khan.,10
Rishabh with those man titties making us more relatable to him,11
Russel in already???????,2
Mishrajis hair looks so out of place lol,3
Mishra paired with Hawaii clothes would give him the perfect Pimp look xD,6
Morgan better come out,5
DRE RUSS has arrived at the arena.,5
"They should've dropped it. The longer Shubman was there the higher the chances of KKR losing.

I think it's the first time I've seen someone play Cricket with a wig,0
"Mishra’s bowling is all good, but what the fuck is up with his hairs? He looks like an anime doraemon",4
Imagine the regular leg spinner making a difference but not the KKR mystery spinners.,2
Mishra Spin Academy.,4
Quite possibly a match losing innings by Gill there.,3
MishraJi is a very humble man. Met him,6
how many of you take a shit and never wash hands? 🤓,-11
Nitish Rana is how CSK wants Kedar to be,3

Enter Andre 'Haiwaan' Russell,3
remembering Mishra's death stare and Sanju walking away from it,3
Idk why but Shubman comes off as more likeable than Prithvi and Pant.,2
Scenes if Russell pulls a Tewatia now😂,2
i can't help but stare at Mishra's hair man. Has fake written all over it,6
This is the match right here. Russell madness for 5 overs will take the match towards KKR.,2
I'm no expert but I'd say Morgan's a better #4 than Russell...,5
If Russel gets going the game will be over in 18th over. lol,2
How do you think Russell will do?,2
"If I'm DC I'd be rubbing my hands at the opportunity to get Russell out of the way early...on the other hand if he gets going, this match is over by 17th over",3
Scenes if Russel pulls a Dhenier now,5
28 off 22 while chasing 230 is not good enough. Too many cricketers who play for themselves over the team. Need more individuals who are willing to take risks even if it affects their personal milestones.,4

I’ll say the same as I did in KKR’s last match. Eoin Morgan should be captain and bat at 4. Anything else is absurd. The guys arguably the best white ball captain of a generation and is relegated to 6 behind karthik?!,5

No, I am not saying that's his game is done but some of the decisions taken by KKR this season are utter stupid and I believe captain has some part to play in those. DK is better off as keeper and finisher instead of captain honestly",7
"Nortje saved 4 runs today and took a brilliant catch, nice stuff",8
Nokia N series,4
Hopefully someone on the KKR bench has reminded DK that he is not 2015 era Dhoni,4

Fuck Nortje fields like he doesn’t play for Delhi.,10
What is the strategy from DK here? Both need to hit it out of the park. No point being an accumulator at this stage.,1
"DK, UTHAPPA,DHONI,JADHAV,WATSON,M.VIJAY... ALL MUST GO..THEY ARE PAST THEIR PRIME. JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE EXPERIENCE,THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN BE IN THE TEAM. JUST GO. HOPE NO ONE BUYS THEM NEXT SEASON.",7

I can name 3 better captains than DK in KKR playing xi. He is clueless.,4

Quite a few people wearing chin diapers.,3
"The KKR batting order is so bad, it actually makes me angry. 

I just cannot get my head around paying all that money for Morgan, to bat him 6 and not give him the captaincy. Narine is obviously becoming a huge issue too. DK batting at 5 ahead of Morgs when you’re a long way behind in the chase? What the fucks that about?",10

FUCK HOSH.,1
"Commentators reckon the game is over. Morgan holds the key tho. This is Sharjah, weirder things have happened here",4

Would be much better.",6
How many batsmen does KKR have?,2
"If I ask you memorable innings by Dinesh Kargil, has there ever been a couple, apart from the Nidhas trophy. I think people rate DK way too much and expect excellence from mediocrity.",9
Let's go we're winning,5
"Acting skills:

Rohit>Virat>Hardick>MS>>>>>Dravid",8
I am so looking forward to Ponting dressing room talk. Those YT videos have been pretty good,10
God damn Morgan needs to play out of his skin to even make this close,5
"DK is not doing himself any favors. Had he come at 6 and hit some sixes over the season, would have still gone for 8 to 10 crores in the next auction. If this continues, will be lucky to get 5 crores especially with Samson and Kishan doing well.",8
At 16 rrr both batsmen need to attack not just Morgan. Cummins can’t be expected to keep up,1
"KKR should send Morgan at number 4. And then send Karthik or Russel depending on the situation. Also, play Tripathi or Banton at the top.",2
Why take Tripathi in team if not opening with him? Narine as an opener hasn't worked this season.,4
I didn’t know Hardik pandya’s side gig was being Jaguar,2
Asking a finished tailender to open and batting an opener at no8. KKR Tactics 101.,8
PSA: please don't watch Laxmi Bomb. It's a remake of an awful Tamil movie.,3
We're like the Everton of IPL. Even when things are going well I'm sure we'll find a way to fuck this up,5
Tripati will do a Nidahas today /s,9
Can KKR just put in Banton for Narine? There's only so long you can run the pinch hitter strategy before you get caught out,10
"DK is shoving Tripathi’s face in the mud here. This is terrible captaincy, you are breaking the morale of an opener by sending guys like Narine and Cummins ahead of him.",14
KKR's team management is even funnier than Barca's.,9
Karthik just doesn't know what to do. He is an example of bad captains. He is clueless.,11
I know Morgan will finish the job for kkr. I bloody well know it.,3
Whose brilliant idea was to make DK the captain anyway? Dude's skills are mediocre at best and takes too much to setup the field which escaltes the over rate.,7
15cr batsman is here,3
"Viay

Uthappa

Jadhav

Karthik

ceos of playing odi in t20",16
"DK has been a shit captain since 2017, no surprise for me",7
This is depressing,2
**BATDEEP****^(tm)** is one thing but sending a specialist batsman at 8 is pure banta,3
For the folks wondering why Tripathi was picked its either fielding or Astrology,4
Haha Cummins and Pant have a special relationship.,1
DK should go back home - Chennai. They won't mind,3
KKR management has absolutely no faith in Tripathi. Must be so demoralizing when bowlers are batting higher than you,4
Replace small dick karthik with quick gun morgan,7
"Tripathi Gill Rana Morgan Russell bsDK Cummins

is it too much to ask for?",3
What is this Jaguar thingy in Hotstar? Looks like a Krissh knockoff.,1
"Dinesh Karthik, specialist captain who is shit at being a captain and leader",4
Can someone give me a good reason why is D.Karthik captain? Did he ever had a great season?,2
Well guided Patty,1
Just utter Garbage strategy. Why play Rahul Tripathi if you not gonna open with him. Same old same old like last season. Probably finish 5th. Whats worse than a bandwagon RCB fan.....a DC fan who is from proper Delhi. I have got two. My weekend is ruined.,5
Why is Tripathi in the side? Cumminso has come above a batsman for duck's sake!,6
"Time for KKR to get a reality check. Narine has become a shadow of his former self. His bowling is being picked apart, batting well... Where do I start. Everyone knows he'll kill the spinners and medium pacers and everyone has been feeding him pace right from the start. 

Playing on borrowed time. Drop Narine, Get Banton in. Or, let Tripathi open and Narine bat low.",15
13 overs and just 6 sixes criminal on this ground.,4
What does Karthik brings to the table except for the sad sympathy gaining face he makes after each batting disappointment or a loss?,10
Hahahhahahhahahhah aaaaahahahhahahah,0

DC Fielding = GOAT TIER,8
"Cummins gone. Unless Morgan can play a beauty, game over.",7
Meanwhile Morgan chilling at 0(0),10
Kkr is worse than csk can't even get close,2

Harshal Patel OP. Cemented his place in the side for me.,5
Harshal Patel is fuckin' everywhere.,6
"**13.3** Nortje to Cummins, OUT,  **122-6**

Yeah go on top in style!,1
Cummdog with a 250 SR,2
Incredibly poor chase especially at this ground,2
Karthik has been the most underperforming cricketers in IPL for many years and still he has been able to find franchise who is ready to pay him in millions. Another cricketer which comes to my mind is Yuvraj Singh.,4
"Which is the worst IPL Captain this time

D.Karthik 

M.S. Dhoni

D. Warner",1
Night Night Knightriders,1
U dont score 200 in sharjah u are a bad team.,1

"If you need experience, make world cup winner Eoin Morgan the captain.
If you need youth, go the delhi capitals way and invest in Shubman Gill as the captain.",6
"Feel bad for Tripathi.

Didn't get to open and cummins sent ahead of him.",5
Fuck off. Just turn the strike over to Morgan :(,5
Lauki Ferguson or Tom Banton should come in for Narine. Tripathi should open. DK after Morgan and Dre Russ,2
"Cummins is out, and Morgan hasn’t played a single ball. Clearly something is wrong with the batting lineup",5
Catches win the matches.,3
"Damn, now the match is truly over :-p",2
Delhi's pace duo is too strong man,6
"Apna time aa gaya BC.

Translation: Triple H time theme!",2
Soo we'll be 9 down and Kuldeep will walk out to bat.,1
"KKR are the new RCB meme team

Fight me",4
Karthik makes Dhoni look like 2013 Gayle,1
No man has milked more out of a single innings than Dinesh Karthik and that Nidahas cup final,17
This is painful to see. Both matches today have turned into one sided contests,6
Morgan just watching buses go by.,2
Another one down,2
"Well done you idiots, you have ruined my Saturday afternoon watching Eoin Morgan

What a sad little life",12

Daily Mark Nicolas appreciation comment ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ,3
Morgan has seen enough BS for today lol,11
I thought Morgan was out,3
Make Morgan the captain you cowards,10
Feel for the batsman in now. Exposed to the better bowlers and having to slog,3
ok. who's the chick,3
Six wickets have fallen and you still have  Morgan and Tripathi batting. How?,8
I hope Murugan hits some mighty blows.,2
And to think KKR's batting would be better without Uthappa,1
[deleted],2
That was a frustration vented out six from Morgan lol,3
Morgan...6? IM SHOCKED,2
Now I realize what Barca fans go through,2
That is why you put Morgan at 4 you morons,7
"When you have a cheat code like Russell in your team, you should be able to atleast qualify for playoffs let alone win the tournament. 

This reminds me of RCB in 2012-2014, who despite having Gayle could not make the playoffs even once.",5

Bowl Ashwin to Morgan,1
"DK's captaincy: Yeh kaafi difficult course hai, kaafi kam log kar paate hai",4
"Fuck you DK for botching this chase.

Just send Morgan at 4 for fucks sake.",4
"I don't want to jinx ut but ever since Gautam left, KKR has descended to RCB level. Not just team management but also ruined players. Kuldeep being an example. Morgan on the list too. The only good thing they have done is Gill. That too after 2 seasons.",5
I really don't understand how Karthik has the chest in each match to come in before Morgan who's twice the player and a recent world cup winning captain.,12
"Dear KKR, 

Will you please play the same XI in the same order in your match against us? 

Sincerely,

RCB",11
Why the fuck would you waste Morgan in this batting line-up? He's such a 🐐!!! 😡,5
It is funny because this pair can also be batting after 2 down.,11
"Stick around Tripathi, show them your worth. Time for redemption!",6
"Once again it’s down to Eoin to try and rescue something again, for the 3rd game in a row. It’s about time the other ‘big names’ in that team stepped up and did their bit too",2

"It's going great for all Rahuls.

Rahul Tewatia, K L Rahul even Rahul Gandhi.

Hope Tripathi also does a Tewatia.",5
"Narine at 1, DK before Morgan, Cummins before Tripathi. Are they choosing the batting order by rolling a dice?",6
"Inner Morgan to himself after 6* (1)

Sure cunts, Send me @6 while chasing 200+",7
There are shit squads like CSK. And then there are brilliant squads like KKR being screwed of their own doing. Terrible management.,21
I think it's time for KKR to drop the naraine as opener strategy so guys like Tripathi and Morgan can bat up the order,8
lmao top 4/6 are catch out in Sharjah,2
"KKR should play for NRR now. Seriously.
IF they manage to qualify for the playoffs, they will do it in the 4th spot. MI, DC, RCB look like the only three teams who have got their combinations right.
And, the 4th spot is almost always come down to NRR.",4
Eoin Morgan 6(1) > DK 6(8),17
"Say what you want about Pant, Samson and co. but if you give them 30 balls in a chase like this they would be on 60/70 runs.",6
Morgan at no.3 would've been a lot better given the current chase.,3
Ponting doing Dhawan's celebration is wholesome.,7
You know that KKR doesn’t watch film or...cricket for that matter. Their batting orders are so out of whack. I get promoting Narine as surprise but you’ve got 6 batters in the hut,5
frustrated batting down the order Morgs gonna smash kkr after the match,9
"A World Cup winning captain in the XI playing under a guy who hasn’t been able to establish himself in an international side after being given regular chances for 2 decades.

narain and dk are using two batting spots and scoring no runs. kkr basically has a 4 batter reliant strategy rn.,9

We will see a DC vs RCB final this year. Heard it here first.,5
"Morgan should bat at 4 and this should be like a commandment, he should bat at 4 no matter what",2
Harshal needs to fix an appointment with the toupee consultant.,6
"I can’t believe DC aren’t dropping those catches, they look superhuman. Or I’m probably saying that because RR were fucking miserable today",5
Was Klusener in circulation when IPLT20 started?,2
Karthik is not at all a smart captain and nor a leader like Gambhir. He should dropped his captaincy. A youngster should be given captaincy.,9
Harshal Patel is 2nd best T20 all rounder after Hardik Pandya in India,2
"KKR is being poorly run. If Tripathi is playing why is he batting at 8?

Sometimes Russel comes in too late, other times Morgan is batting too low. They make a new mistake every game.",15

2. Gill

How tf is that wide? Umpire tryinf his best for KKR today,7
"Opener coming at 7, number 7 even after playing shit for last 3 games, still opens. 

KKR",5
Harshal Patel is one of the most improved bowlers in last 3 years.,7
I will take CSK not trying and scoring 200 than this chase by KKR what even are they doing.,4
Do you think DK makes sure Morgan bats low so he can't challenge his authority as captain?,2
WHAT IS THIS LEGENDARY BOWLING HARSHAL BABY I LOVE YOU,3
Shreyas Iyer looks like Indian Magnus Carlsen,5
"DC at 1, RCB at 2, CSK at the bottom of the table. 2020 hitting us in ways we never expect.",3
Really impressed with Harshal's bowling tonight. Haven't missed Ishant for one second.,3
Morgan needs to take up the captaincy,5
[deleted],0
90 odd runs from 6 overs... ok then,1
Tripathi could've gone to Dubai and come back while waiting for that bouncer to reach him.,1
KKR should just drop DK and Narine and sort out their batting order.,5
A successful chase still possible?,2
RCB wondering where was this Harshal Patel,2
[deleted],2
I know Russell's probably been pushing for a top order spot but you can't make sense of a team that has Narine and Russell in the batting order above Tripathi and Morgan. Makes no cricketing sense.,4
If that's a wide then cancel cricket,2
Why do we let the game drift instead of killing it is beyond me. Bowl your best bowlers now.,2

I swear to god there was an MI batsman in orange cap chase. I swear.,1
Hetmeyer moving and looking like a squirrel,4
"Morgan should be batting higher than Karthik. The surfaces aren't too spin-friendly to trouble Morgan. Karthik despite all his experience is in a poor form, and he must respect that as a captain and promote Morgan who is a great batsman in a pretty decent hitting form.",9
90 off 30. This is RCB vs MI runchase.,4
Pretty good bowling tbf,2
Too high,2
Dinesh Karthik is fourth on the list of most IPL matches played. It's only because there weren't many quality wicketkeepers back then,4
"If DK was India's captain, he would've opened with Chahal and made Kohli bat at 6 for sure.",9
Clearly a No Ball,5
That's not out,1
KKR in need of proper batsman in middle overs.,2
I love how the world cup winning captain is not good enough to captain your team,2
Harshal's action reminds me of Mohammad Sami's action. Except that he is probably 10kmph slower than Sami.,1

Why the check?  If you can't spot that you don't deserve to stand there.,7
Hetmyer looks like that muscular Pokemon running around,6
Ahh.. brilliant spell spoiler by this no ball..,6
i feel so bad for morgan. he doesn't deserve to be in this cluster-fuck.,12

"KKR feels like a team of players who don't talk with each other. 

Nariane keeps on being sent as an opener 

Russel comes in and throws away his wicket because his ego is bigger than his IQ

DK comes and plays a test match when chasing 200+

Morgan who is a world class captain and batsman is languishing down the order at 6/7

need a serious overhaul.",9
The umpires dumb or what!,6
Lmfao they give that wide but have to check for the most blatant of no balls,11
Great spell by Harshal,2
That too was a no ball lol,11
That's not a no ball?!?,9
"KKR needs roughly around 90 runs from 30 balls

"Was that a Noball too?

Got away with it. Good for him.",5
Wtf? Wasn't that above waist height?,9
10 balls 30+ for next 30 balls,2
WTF is wrong with this umpire,6
WTF,5
Need 1 more from Rabada to keep his 2+ wicket streak going,1
KKR quite easily have the worst captain & the worst jersey.,2
That was a no ball 😡,2
Should have gotten better umpire provided the money they make.,2
That's kinda sus,2
Wasn't that a no ball as well,7
Umpires are so blind soon they’ll start going upstairs when batsman is clean bowled. Assuming batsman’s don’t walk,6
Is that Rahul Tripathi batting at 8 while DK is promoting himself to the middle order?,2
Although maybe it isn't a no ball because Harshal bowls at a spinner's pace,3
Blind Umpires,1
I swear KKR are deciding which batters to send using a magic 8 ball,5
Follow up also looked like a no ball.,3
Expecting 2 more wickets for Rabada,1
Suddenly umpires have decided to make dk look good,1
"What a spell by harshal, he and axar are severely underrated",3
"KKR makes me pull my hair out
 
Brain dead management",3
WTF! THAT WAS ANOTHER NO BALL!,10
Bowler from rcb academy ofc,1

Lol Rcb at the top with the worse net run rate.,11
Yikes I went away for a bit and I come back to this kohlapse...,2
KKR needs to score atleast 15 in every over now,6
Time to get serious. Tripathi should open and Morgan at 3,8
DK is a liability,3
Why didn't anyone check for the 2nd no ball??,6
Cunt it like Morgan 😍,6
Rahul Chapati should be no where near this XI,2
When KKR bought Morgan I thought that was an excellent move. Brilliant leader as well as gun middle order player. Then came the after auction press conference & they said Karthik will be captain. Knew no way this is gonna work. Still pretty early to the tournament but I don't think they have the balls to do the right thing.,4
">ye main kar leta hoon, dream 11 pe team banalo

I've seen this being used quite a bit in the comments... is this an Ad running on Indian television?",6
"Having followed KKR very closely from the start, I do not think they have the type of management or owners who will change captains mid season.
And, I do not think any good can come of it, at least for this season. I am sure they will back DK for this IPL. Depending on the result, there might be changes next year.",8

Nortje is a brilliant fielder.. what a good find for us.,5

Rahane shitting in field as well,-2
DK to be replaced by morgan like rahane-smith?,3
"If they can drop DK , make Morgan the captain, and I bet this team starts winning right away",7
Two caps don't make you tall Jinx,3
Why are they playing Morgan at 6? The guy is a world cup winning captain who clears the rope with ease..,6
Wait. Rahane is a sub for DC?,4
"Is it a rule or something that the substitute has to wear 2 caps? Negi did it the other day, and Rahane today",6
Tewatia time??,1
"So Tripathi who did well as an opener, so at least theoretically has a good chance of doing well at the top, comes in at 8. Where Narine, who has been found out for what, two years now, continues to open without adding anything to the team total. You'd think they would at least swap these two players' positions? 

I know we as fans don't see how players are shaping up in practice but results seem to indicate a change in batting strategy is long overdue for KKR. 

Again, looking purely at results, Tripathi, Gill, Rana, Morgan, Russell, DK, Narine seems a better structured lineup.",12
Rahane thinking having 2 caps will somehow increase his height,6
Pollard would have caught that,1
I kinda feel bad for Karthik...,-1
KKR management should really have a nice discussion about FUCKING BATTING ORDER,6
Bowl Ashwin to Morgan ffs,2
"KKR : lack of intent from captain 
Csk : first time ?",10
What is Dinesh even offering the KKR side anymore? Please don't say captaincy. What else?,10
KKR need to open with Tripathi and Gill,5
Did Rahane just ruin Rabada's 10 match 2+ wickets streak?,3
"Let me tell you the two weakest link in KKR team. 
1) Karthik.
2) International batsman (Narine, Morgan and Russel aren't the kind of batsman that are going to win you a tournament as they lack consistency.)",5

Kkr can try to save their nrr here,6
Bc 2 stoinis overs left. Rcb mode off stoinboi,9
Morgan is the Number 1 on the list of big hitters who don’t look like big hitters,13
Imagine sending Morgan at 6 lol.,5
"KKR management sure has Einstein levels of IQ. Playing with basically 10 players since they planned to treat Triphathi as a fielder who can bat a bit, Eoin Morgan coming jn at #6 when he bats at #4 for England, which has a ton of attacking talent in LOIs, while sending in inferior players like Karthik before him. 

I loved McCullum but this is some next level shit.",15
Tomorrow MI v SRH in Sharjah. What's gonna happen?,5
From being an uprising star opener with Dravid  to captaining an ipl team to substitute fielder.. Rahane has come a long way,8
I feel bad for Tripathi it's unfair,9
DK is a liability,3
KKR electing to chase knowing very well what the score would be and chasing like this. Very poor from them.,7
Morgan struggles against short ball. Let’s bowl full.,4
How are Rahane's credentials as a T20 player?  I've only watched him in test cricket,6
"78 from 24 looks easy. MI scored 79 in 4 vs RCB, and CSK needed 78 from 24 yesterday, lost by just 7",9
Good to see MNREGA now allows beneficiaries to outsource their work to third parties.,5
bowl a spinner you cowards,2
"Need 78 off 24, now where have I seen this before",2
Dk should just step aside from captaincy.,4
Never knew slow full toss is Morgan weakness.,3
Big over,1
"If Morgan pulls this off, he should be made captain immediately",2
Nortje?,1
I wonder whether we will bat or chase tommorow.,1
RIP Stoinis bowling career.,2
DK is being threatened by Morgan’s presence and is denying him opportunities to bat higher.,6
I'm scared that daddy Pollard is going to spank us tomorrow,3
Would like to see Rahane getting game time at some point.,2
My god is Stoinis hot,3
"Random, but what’s the reason KKR let Gambhir go? He seemed like a good captain and consistent performer",3
DC gonna produce another 2012 this season,7
This over need to be fucking Big,5
Want to see Ashwin bowl.,1
Morgan is arguably the best #4 white ball player currently and he doesn’t get to bat at #4 in IPL?,11
why tf stoonis bowling when Ashwin still got overs left,2
[Brace yourself for SRH tomorrow](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi.pinimg.com%2F236x%2Fcc%2Fa9%2Fa5%2Fcca9a50e73c27b895569b2c1f3e77a44.jpg&f=1&nofb=1),2
A 40-run over here makes it interesting,1
Cunt it Morgan. Cunt them all!!,1
"Oh no, KP is here",3
DC really wants Morgan to score with those juicy full tosses,3
"[Here are some English domestic mascots re-enacting the ball from the World Cup final super over](https://twitter.com/surreycricket/status/1312445177110253569?s=20)

Wonderful to see.",3
[deleted],2
Delhi can play Sams instead of Heytmer.,3
Umpires - kkr DC match going on still talking about kohli every 5 mins,1
NRR,3
"Morgan - one of the best white ball players

DK - Player past his prime who was not a regular in national team in his prime",6
KKR just need a Lungi 2 ball 27,2
maybe KKR and DC should just swap Rahane with DK so that Rahane gets to play and DK can be comfortably benched.,4
"Tripathi!!!

Wasn't expecting that.",3
What a massive six,2
Where's SRK?,2
Why arent they showing the broken car,3
Why the fuck was a bowler sent ahead of a batsman. Why? WHY?,7
Tripathi throwing shade at KKR management,8
"Every team has now figured Narine. It's time to allow a proper opener to open with Gill. Narine is also very weak in running b/w the wickets. Morgan needs to bat before Karthik, he is a match winner.",8
"Morgan deserves to be the captain of KKR, the earlier their think tank realise this the better, Dinesh Karthik hasn't shown anything leadership worthy for a while & instead has only been pulling the team down by promoting himself to unusual positions without justifying anything, Moreover Morgan as Captain can truly help groom Gill as a Leader",14
Tripathi's stance is so orgasmic.,4
These guys need to bat up... And DK at 11!,5
Show the management Tripathi. Show em.,6
"Doable? yes

Against Rabada ? highly doubtful",6
"Should be KKR Team Meeting

Best batsmen? - Eoin Morgan
Play him at his ideal spot: No.4

In form batsmen? - Nitish Rana
Play him where he is performing: No. 3

Specialist Openers? - Shubhman and Tripathi
Fucking open with them: No. 1 & No. 2

Best finishers we have? - Russell and DK
Always go Russell first, then DK. Unless there's a major pile up at the start. 

Bowlers who can Bat? Cummins Nagarkotti Narine",42
fuckin banton warming the benches and morgan coming in after the game is done.,11
"If ur name is Rahul, there's 💯 chance that u will have a good season",10
Mishra was bowling well but only bowled 2. Iyer thinks he is batting against spinners or some shit.,7
is tripathi good?,6
Don't fuck this up DC,3
Surely we can't lose this...,4
11 sixes needed in 21 balls.,3
All the runs Morgan and Tripathi hit will score now is going to make DK look bad.,8
Tripathi and Morgan have already started conspiring to injure DK during next net session.,12
Stoinis helping making this match interesting..,3
All hail lord STOINIS,3
Tewatia = Tripathi,3
abbey yaar stoinis,1
Have KKR left too much for the end?,2
Rahul Tripathia,9
Rahul T at Sharjah towards the end of a run chase..hmm..,3
"Dhat, too late now. Shows u it was achievable for kkr.",2
"Come on, Stoned-nis. You can do this.
Let's make the game interesting.",3
"
Stoinis getting tonked by big dick Tripathi",3
Err Stoinis now was really not a good decision...,3
Bc stoinis RCB mode off rcb mode off,3
Delhi trying their best to lose.,3
I would really like to see Morgan leading KKR in the remaining matches.,4
This is why Sharjah is dogshit,2
"Gill, Tripathi, Rana, Morgan, Russell, DK, Cummins, Nagarkoti, Narine, Mavi, Chakravarthy

This should have been the batting order.",6
How does DK come out ahead of this guy ?,9
Why isn’t Tripathi opening?????,3
Shubman Gill just casually striking at 127 chasing 230,6
lmao,3
Rahul Tewatia then Rahul Tripathi today?,2
Just fuckin' send Tripathi to open and get Narine the fuck away from opening.,6
Since KKR have actual batsmen playing this is actually still possible,3
Tripathi doing the Tewatia here,1
10 sixes in 20 balls. They can certainly do this.,3
Hold on! It's not over yet!,2
Rahuls are way too OP for this league,7
I'm starting to think they should have opened with Tripathi,6
Unorthodox management tip - always send your specalist batsmen out to bat before the bowlers,9
"Delhi being afraid. Like bruh. We (KKR) don't even have a chance. You have Rabada, calm tf down",2
What's with the weird helmets of DK and Thripati,3
Where is Ben Cutting though ?,1
Poetic that Tripathi is dragging KKR back here,6
tripathi's already done more than narine has this season,6
Wooooo 👏👏,2
OMFG Tripathi,3
Stoin getting taken to the damn cleaners. Rest of the pacers saved his ass.,1
Rahul naam toh suna hi hoga,7
Narine is useless imo .,2
Wow and they held tripathi back and made Narine open instead. Genius.,2
God dc can’t even hold this win,1
"If Morgan chases this down, the captaincy should be his.",1
Stoinis is sex,1
"Didn't Tripathi kill it as a opener at RPSG?

Why the fuck is he coming in at 8?",10
Yeah tripathy! Show DK how stupid and disrespectful his captaincy has been,10
Stoinis ensuring this goes down the wire,2
BC why bowl Stoinis this over anyway,3
Two players batting in their unnatural positions are now KKR's last hope,9
Morgan-Tripathi to KKR Management: You fucking mongrels...,13
Should have gambled with Mishraji,5
Stoinis shouldn’t be expected to bowl more than 2 overs. Cmon now,11
"Morgan cannot chase this alone, but with support from Tripathi he can. This is not over yet.",10
"""Rahul"" is new sharmaji ka beta",8
This fucking match,8
Amazing how this team can turn defending RRR of 18 into a nail-biter,11
Those two sixes would be sixers in any ground,6
Yaar kkr walo yeh Tripathi nahi chahiye to de do hame.,6
Tripathi striking better than Morgan 😍,9
Game on bois,6
This ground in awesome. Nothing is safe.,9
Sàala kya slice kar raha hai yeh,10
"Every boundary these guys hit, i wonder about the dot balls in the middle overs",6
Sunny bhai... it is eighteen point two-nine and not Eighteen point twenty-nine,11
KKR is the worst managed team since GG left.,15
Ridiculous over.. Rabada come and save this game now..,3
If KKR don't change their order after this...,6
Rahul's are doing pretty well in the pandemic.,6
Tewatia 2.0 if Tripathi can pull this off,7
Lololol 54 off 18 is gettable.,5
Ohh no DC PTSD catching me up :'(,5
Big Daddy Tripathi,2
Wht typr of shot was that!!!?,2

Rahul Tripatia,3
"Wow!! What a big dick SIX  
Why are they hiding big hitters in the shed???",2
Stoinis lord confirmed,2
Holy shit another good script today,4
MADERCHOD STOINIS BKL,4
"Opener doing what he is told coming in at number 8

Fucking make him open",5
Rahul Tripathi was so much better than Rahane at RPSG,3
Triphathi pulling a Tewatia!,3
"Narine, DK, Dre and Cummins batted before this guy?",5
Salman Khan looks like a zombie,3
Now give us a 30 run over from Morgan,2
DC is the new KXIP who were the new RCB,2
And they didn't use him at top.,3
TEWATIA 2.0 !!!!!,0
KKR need 50(12) + 4 off Rabada.,2
We need to defend now can't have another Tewatia innings,2
Is that lord tewatia in disguise?,2
Tripathi-Morgan pulling off a Tewatia?,1
Stoinis having an absolute stinker of a game,1
Tripathi: I just wanna say ~~thank you~~ fuck you to our captain Dinesh Karthik.,1
"DC: Look at me, I am the RCB now",2
"One more big over, only one over left from Rabada, kkr can still do it",3
I don’t see why you don’t bowl Stoinis  in 18 and 20 if he has to bowl at all. This is just stupid captaincy.,3
If only Tripathi had opened \*sigh*,2
Gambhir was the right person for such a fuckall management. keep em at bay and lead the team.,4
(Rahul T)(ewatia + ripathi),-1
These are not boundaries. These are slaps being hit on DK's face by Tripathi,3
Now KKR management will think that Tripathi is a great finisher and not make him open,9
save us lord rabada,2
Give this man a chance to open.,2
Tripathi has higher SR than captain morgan :o,3
Stoinis taking it deep..,3
Oh God why the fuck hold them back for so late,3
Stoinis v T Curran in a who can shit the bed more match bowling at the death.,1
Tripathiaa 😍,4
Here we go again. Sharjah you cruel ground,3
5 full tosses in the over. nice gentle height as well. utter shit bowling. wtf was that?,5
Common one big over from Morgan. And Ashwin or Stoinis to bowl one of the remaining three.,1
Tripathi and Narine should exchange their batting positions,4
Make it stop,2
"Inspite of the amazing season as opener for RPS in 2017, Rahul Tripathi comes in at No 8!",2
THIS IS THE OVER.,3
This is the shit why I have grey hair at 26,6
On the roof wtf hahahahaha,2
Who's that sitting with Baz?,3
The atma which had possessed Tewatia has moved into Tripathi,8
bruh i thought it was in hands,3
DC getting nervous now...,4
Block hole boys.. bowl there..,2
Morgan...u beauty...,1
Cummings can star in Netflix Movie damn,1
Rahul Tewatia that day. Rahul Tripathi today. Rahuls have a thing for run chases at Sharjah.,5
Harr Gaye BC :(,2
any other ground and this was out..,3
No No KKR. These are accidental shots and not by a proper batsman. Fuck Rahul Tripathi. Have Narine open always.,6
"Tripathi’s SR is 280 @8 , so clearly that’s the best position for him.

~DK, probably at the post match interview",9
Damn I thought that was going to be caught,1
Holy cow Morgan,1
Lmao. That looked like it was going to be pouched by the keeper,3
The biggest trick 2017 RCB pulled off was making KKR think Narine opening is a great idea,3
Send in Koach to bowl....,3
The fuck.... Mishit out of the stadium...,5
KKR still in for a chance with Morgan playing like this.,3
Fuck me morgan,5
Can't help but think how RCB bowling attack is gonna get butchered at Sharjah,6
"Rahul's are doing well this IPL, Tewatia, Tripathi and Chahar. This game is far from over.",2
That was an edge SunnyG. It wasn't placed,3
"Fuck, great shot!",4
Quick Gun Morgan,4
"It would only be a Tewatia if he was pure shit for the first 20 balls and we all called for him to retire, chill out guys",3
"If KKR win this, this be an 64D underwater backgammon move by DK",4
That 75 meter is a six on most grounds,5
DK is done now no excuses,4
Haha top edge goes out of the stadium. Ban this ground already.,2
"I would love to see Tripathi nearly end it from here but deliberately fail to make 5 off last 2 balls, then say a big Fuck You! to the management. 

'If I had finished it, u would be putting me at 8 the entire season, no thanks! Gimme my opener's role and let that blind Carribean swinger try to cunt it down the order'- Tripathi after the match",1
Can't understand why people even bowl Stoinis at the death after what Russell did to him both games last year .,2
Feels like last over mishap from DC innings gonna bite back,1
Oh lord what the hell was that,1
Lol wtf was that commentary. Made me think it was falling inside inner circle.,3
"And this man is batting behind Cummins. pathetic management

They have resources combined of 2 best IPL team and this is what comes with Poor captaincy where captain have to make himself relevant somehow",1
Tripathi and Morgan brought kKR back in game,2
"Open with Tripathi and Gill, KKR ! Narine can’t slog anymore .",1
"Oh god, this is nuts",3
Why didn't DC bowl Mishra earlier? They've fucked themselves just like KXIP did...,1
Do it Captain Morgan,5
"KKR should play their batsman in the reverse order if they want a chance to win. 

Tripathi, Morgan >> DK, Nariane, Cummins, Dre Russ",1
WTF??? Top edge out of the stadium.,5
What an ultra big dick SIX>>>>>>Morgan you beauty,3
Stoinis an ex RCB and ex KXIP player. Checks out,5
Mouth watering contest this.,3
Morgan would have been probably around 80 from 35 balls at this point had he come at #4,10
"For a tiny man, Morgan really packs a punch.",2
"Top edge goes for a 75 m six showing:
1) Rabada's speed
2) Morgan's crazy ass bat speed.",5
I wonder how many balls are lost up on the ceiling of the Sharjah stadium.....,3
It's painful watching other teams matches this year. QQ,2
Maar Morgan maar,3
This IPL is brought to you by Old timers who still think they could win the game instead fucks up the chase and ruin it for other players who could seriously win the match.,7
FUCK OFF,3
Delhi can’t lose this can they?,1
"As much as we all love Rabada, it's great to watch a close game nevertheless",1
Is Morgan the best 6 hitter in white ball cricket right now?,1
"Sure seeing loads of sixes is fun, but this ground needs nuking sooner rather than later.",9
Okay okay...it's getting intresting now. Loving this,3
M not watching this.,5
Morgan showing his class to KKR management,2
THAT'S MY CAPTAIN,6
Stoinis will bowl the final over bwahahahhah,3
Why length balls now... My god..,1

Murugan Tewatia,3
Come on man,1
Rabada too has lost the plot.. bowl Yorkers mate..,2
7 six remaining to win the match.,1
Morgan is amazing!,2
"*As one commentator mentioned a week ago, ""only delhi can lose from here""*",6

Aarggghhgh Dadddyyy Morgan give it to me Daddyy What a SIX,2

Fuck it. Make Morgan the mayor of Kolkata,3
Wow. Just saw the scorecard. They unironically sent Cummins before Rahul,5
Fuck,1
5d chess by karthik. False sense of security then reverse the order. Sacrificed himself on purpose 🌶,1
Ahh shit here we go again,2
"DK needs to fuckoff, srsly what is this",2
I am scared shitless of our game here tomorrow,2
"If Morgs and Tripathi pull this off DK will continue as captain, might continue regardless, KKR haven't really shown ambition for past 3 seasons. Ffs you have Morgan in the team who is being played out of position.",1
Please writers  please let it be a super over,2
daddy morgan,3
What composure! What style!,2
OH CAPTAIN MY CAPTAIN,1
KKR just scored 50 in the last 2.2 overs wtf,4

Win or lose dk is sweating in dugout,7
Small cricket grounds are bad for  cricket,1
"DK: ""Plot twist, MC!""",2
This is getting interesting now.,2
Sharjah is worse than Chinnaswamy imo.,4
so who is retrieving these balls from the roof tops?,6
Off topic. Who's the chick tho,2
KKR had less than 1% chance to win this match at 16th over now 10%,2
Ban Sharjah pls..,8
Morgan maar raha hai...,4
Petition to make Sharjah a permanent fixture in IPLs. Let every team play there once every season.,7
"Anything under 35 for last 2 overs, game is with kkr",2
Iyer pissing his pants all the sudden,4
shit head captaincy by Iyer giving Stoinis an over ahead of Ashwin,6
"If Morgs and Tripathi pull this off DK will continue as captain, might continue regardless, KKR haven't really shown ambition for past 3 seasons. Ffs you have Morgan in the team who is being played out of position.",6
3 in 3 lmao,7
Make Morgan captian after this match. DK is dumb.,7
6 sixers. Calling it,8
WOOOOOO,1
Morgan captain already ffs,4
lol top edge goes out of ground. smol af ground.,1
17 sixes Morgan 💪,2
See this is what Eoin can do. Unfortunately he came in too late that he has been left too much to do (probably).,1
I can’t fucking believe this.,3
I hate it here,1
"Fuck me, Rabada doing a Cottrell",2
DC replacing RCB,1
Eoin demanding to be KKR captain now.,2
Rabada lmaooooooo,1
"You can’t really call any game out of reach these days , can you ? :(",1

Lol.. utter shot bowling going on..,2
EOIN FUCKING MORGAN,5
"Morgan hits a six on the last ball of the game. Takes out a piece of paper:

Yeh DK. Talk Nah. Bat Nah. Captain Nah.",7
God damn it,1
Morgan looking to out-Tewatia Tripathi,3
Let's goo,2
Fuck,1
"Hits the roof - only 75m. 

Shows how stupid the distance measure actually is. They should use hawkeye to predict it down to pitch level to get a more accurate idea of how big the ball is hit",3
"Idk what made me stop at 93 in 31, oh yes the rrr",3
TEWATIA 2.5,3
Wow,1
BC yeh kya ho raha hia ... how is this even possible,3
Morgan doing a tewatia except he was good from the start,4
Now I totally understand the bowlers' reluctance to bowl yorkers in this IPL.,3
Another ONE> Daddy Morgan coming to party,2
Morgans really become a world class bat over the last couple of years,5
Not nailing the Yorkers KG,0
Morgan treating Rabada like a net bowler,9

Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh,1
Wtf bowling is that,2
HOLD ME EOIN,6
Morgan batting himself to captaincy position.,9
Damn son,1
Its even more fun when you dont care about either team..,3
My favourite ever six is when Jimmy Anderson hooked Rabada at Lords,5
You've got this Morgan,2
38 runs in the last 9 balls.,2
Holy shit,2
"Sharjah made a deal with someone, Miandad six, Sachin desert storm. The games here.",1
Morgan showing some BDE,1
3 in a row... My captain Morgan 😍😍😍😍.,5
Morgan taking Rabada apart there and wtf are those full-tosses.,3
Goodbye DK,3
And people thought morgan was over hyped,4
Common rabada lets pull stuart broad,1
Who hits ranada for 3 sixes in a row even though in Sharjah,1
Tbf Rabada needs to bowl some slow cutters right about now,1
"DK did a rohit there by sending Morgan and tripathi down the order(similar to nidahas trophy)
4d chess by dinesh",1
"PLEASE NOT AGAIN, MY BRAIN HURTS",1
I go away for some time and this happens,1
Oh Captain My Captain,2
Ok im gonna rewind there,1
Fuck off cameraman i don't waana watch SRK's daughter. Show me the real hottie Morgan,3
The 2 openers + Russell + Karthik + Cummins scored a combined 55(47) on this pitch lol,2
DK not happy there. Thinks he’s done as a captain now.,2
"I imagine the game has changed quite a bit since India, Pak used to play in Sharjah in the 90s... I don't remember such big hits.",3
Omg morgan teaching some lessons here,2
Dugout is fucking shit. Lara saying that Narine would have been in Morgan's position if he didn't open. God,2
Oh no.,2
Rabada putting up application to dinda academy,2
kal dhoni bhi yahi karega dekhna,3
1088D plan from DK to send morgan down the order just to make match interesting,1
Also don't think ground measurements can be excuse here this is totally Morgan's brilliance,1
Last 9 balls 42 runs lmao,4
Real Batting has started from KKR after 6 Down. It was just a teaser till now.,6
DK watching his career go down in flames,3
ball ur jaw breaking bouncer Rabada,1
[deleted],8
Who this chick,2
Rabada ki economy ka kardiya Morgan ne kabada,4
Casual reminder that this would never happen in a CSK match cause they would have shut shop 2 overs ago,4
DK's expression!,5
I don’t know if I should be happy we have sharjah or be sad,2
Dinesh Karthik looks dead inside there.,4
4D chess by Dk to send morgan late and make the game more interesting,3
WTF is happening to death bowling this IPL?? Everyone is bowling pies.,7
DK stressed as he is on the verge of losing captaincy,5
What brain-dead bowling.,3
Whos the hottie,5
Narain should be dropped. Karthik demoted. Banton in. Match would've been over by now,4
playing an extra bat helped umm,2
"if this ain't a confidence boost for Cottrell, idk what can be",4
"DC: noooooo you can't hit 6-rinos like that

KKR: haha Morgan go brrrrr",7
DK knows he fucked up,3
Cameraman of the year goes to...,2
MAKE MORGAN CAPTAIN CMON SRK,3
DK sad seeing his own teammate hitting 6s... Now that shows how fucked up KKR is,8
What can you do but laugh... We're never winning this tournament,4
16% chance to win now,2
Anyone knows who that girl was?,1
A reminder that whoever put Morgan to bat at 6 is a fucking moron and needs removing from their post immediately...,13
DK getting a lesson on Captain's knock.,6
That one took ages  between 2 balls,3
Eoin “English Rahul Tewatia” Morgan,6
New drinking game: Take one shot of Captain Morgan everytime Morgan hits one out of the park...,1
Wait... redemption arc???,2
See off Rabada now and KKR become favorites,1
Shit just got real,2
You can chase anything in Sharjah,2
thank fuck rabada jesus christ,2
Idk if Dinesh Karthik is happy or punching the air cause his captainship can be taken away any game now,4
Last 9 balls 42 runs!!!,3
"Who is the girl in the white/black top????

I need to see more of her um supporting the team",4
Fuck combo breaker :(,2
"If Rabada doesn't get a wicket here, KKR are easily getting 30 off 2.",6
43 in last 9 balls,6
This ground is peak Chinnaswamy,11
If only DK had the sense to send Morgan up the order.,9
"Holy shit, these two might actually pull this off",5
That looks like SRK’s daughter,7
"Yuvraj is the happiest person now, but he won't he  happier for too long if teams continue to play at Sharjah",3
"YEAH BRAINDEAD CUNTS, SEND MORGS @ 6.",7
DK hopelessly watching the skipper play. Lol,7
NOOOOO,2
Conspiracy is that Rabada and Ngidi are same person who bowls with 2 actions and has an they have a player who impersonates the other with a mask when they play together.,7
9 balls 42 runs. DC really fucking this up 🤦🏾,6
Aw man!!,3
Its time to remove DK from captaincy and give it to Morgan. No reason for DK to bat ahead of Morgan.,16
NOT OUT,5
Rabada planned for Russell but Morgan came out of syllabus,3
Morgan asking Tripathi to breathe,3
Not out pls,1
Isn't it no ball,1
Super over please,1
Tripathy looks confident. Has IPL Umpiring™ struck again? Yes it has,12
Helmet I reckon,4
Oh come on,1
Helmet I think,4
Very gettable from here,3
replaced umps with robos,4
Why is every team being hell bent on becoming RCB except RCB,13
I'm just fuckin' enjoyin this now,3
"I actually don't want us to win this. If we win, they're not going make the changes this team desperately needs. Narine will open again and DK will come in early again.",3
Super Over? Anyone?,2
It hit the helmet. Not out.,2
Really want KKR to win here after what DC did to us,6
"Oh my, possibly game winning if this is out, E: we good",1
Wish we had someone like Rahul tripathi at KXIP,1
imagine no reviews,3
The fighting Irish,1
Rock n Roll baby,2
Not Out,3
That looks not out to me!,1
Off the helmet,1
Saved a wide there,2
Panty boi's catch in vain :(,1
Is this umpire blind or something?,3
That's not a no ball?,3
IPL UMPIRING,8
Never understood why can't they fast forward to ultra edge. Why waste time.,3
Morgan averaging 135 this ipl,5
Not out,1
"Every captain getting the Virat at Chinnaswamy treatment this year, and I'm loving it",11
Isnt that wide,3
"Rohit, de kock, Ishan, Hardik, Pollard vs a SRH with likely no Bhuvi tomorrow in Sharjah.",4
Let me guess. Umpire to waste a minute before finally going to ultra edge,3
"Loving the way Morgan is talking to Tripathi. Clearly can see him say, Be calm, we got this.",7
TAKEITBACK TAKEITBACK TAKEITBACK,6
Just check ultraedge. Why wasting time,8
Come on! The ball was nowhere near the bat. How's there a spike tho. Ultra edge seems sus now,7
Cummins position was DK's right position. He is more effective when there are few overs left.,7
I'll be destroyed if we lose this.,9
Take it back....take it back,3
Why is that not a No Ball? Hit him on the helmet standing up,6
DK is done. Or at least he should be with any sane team.,5
Mood kharab kar diya BC saara,2
Ultra edge the real imposter,8
Hell yeah,2
Ball is kissing the helmet,7
Fuck me we’ll never win the tournament fucking cursed team,17
Bro we've found something smaller than the ground,10
"legend says, he is still taking it back",16
Ball is kissing the helmet - 3rd umpire,13
Indian umpires are dumbfucks,6
tbh Morgan- Russel is second best middleorder  than Pandya-Pollard,8
Hetmyer's swing and misses in the last over could prove to be the difference here.,12
This is KKR's game now,2
Yup.. this match is lost boys.. graveyard for bowlers..,4
Every good bowler has a bad day,4
"98 required off 36
To
30 required off 12",4
Rabada's economy rate ruined,3
Wow orgasmic FOUR,4
23 in a Rabada over!,5
Totally achievable,2
Tripaaaathi you fucking beauty 😍,2
Well this is now KKR's game. Please save us Mishraji,2
That 7 run 20th over cost Delhi,6
Let's gooo,1
Easily gettable with one over from Ashwin or Stoinis.,1
Ok. Umpiring has been dogshit in this IPL. Where's Robogough when we need him?,1
Who the fuck is going to bowl the remaining over now!!,2
Wtf is happening,3
Nortje and Stoinis???,3
Nortje this over. Has to be.,3
Horrors of DC 20th over are gonna haunt them now.,4
"What a great leveler this sport!

And what an exciting IPL this has been. Just when you think that they are dead and buried, someone plays an insane innings.",4
Rabada ended up with the worst figures wtf,3
Tripathi doing all the hardwork to get cucked by Narine the slogger.,9
15 of each over and we get a super over,3
Why on earth do KKR keep bringing Morgan out at 6?,7
Lololol Stoinis is going to bowl the last over,2
"I thought they would get 4 off Rabada.  

Tewatist Cricketrics has changed the game forever.",6
Nice half century Rabada,2
Is siraj in a rabada costume for Halloween?,1
We need to bowl them dots or we're done,1
31 off 12 with an over of Stoinis or one of the spinners. Game's in the bag for KKR.,2
"31 of 2, Sharjah ruining blood pressures",2
"These 2 are saving whoever fucked up the batting order, right now.",2
Imagin if such last 5 over gameplay is transferred to odi game,2
Rabada 2+ wicket streak ruined,1
Ban this ground ffs,4
[removed],2
Rabada’s economy :’(,6
That last over that went for only 7 gonna cost us.,2
"Bowl Mishra, hit or miss",2
"Holy shit I don't remember the last time Rabada was destroyed so thoroughly in a single over. Half the balls weren't that bad too, Sharjah really is a bowler's graveyard.",5
This is KKR's game to lose now.,1
It's all on this Nokia dude now,2
"Binga: That was pure Whushka.

BC Lara: What's Whushka?

Binga: Whushka is the sound of the bat when the ball goes Whushka.",3
"Watching this I finally realised what that Tewatiya innings was :

First half Dinesh Kartik, second half Eoin Morgan.",3
TAKE IT BACK TAKE IT BACK TAKE IT BACK ONE MORE TIME ONE MORE TIME FORWARD FORWARD TAKE IT BACK TAKE IT BACK TAKE IT BACK ONE MORE TIME ONE MORE TIME FORWARD FORWARD TAKE IT BACK TAKE IT BACK TAKE IT BACK ONE MORE TIME ONE MORE TIME FORWARD FORWARD TAKE IT BACK TAKE IT BACK TAKE IT BACK ONE MORE TIME ONE MORE TIME FORWARD FORWARD,5
We need dots lots of dots,2
Hindi commentators would've praised Kohli/Dhoni/Rohit for batting Tripathi at 8.,7
"Dil bechara

Translation: The Fault in our Stars",3
Koach watching this be like “This is how I felt every season.”,4
I think dew is making it hard for bowlers to control. Probably bowl slower but use change of pace. Nortje's over is the key.,3
I think she looks good with the mask on,2
"Csk, take notes",2
That last over for 7 might come back to bite us,2
Fucking Rabada showing his South African roots there,1
DK is so dumb really what does he expect going in before these and sending pat cummins as well lmao,2
Drop Naraine. Rana to open with Gill/Tripathi with the other to come at 3.,2
Watch Nokia N series deliver right here!!,2
Who's bowling the last over,2
30 off 2 overs with one of them from Stoinis? Oof,3
Whos gonna bowl the last over,2
This is what feels like to field at Chinnaswamy. Every team experiencing this I'm loving it.,5
Its more in favour of kkr now than dc.,1
This IPL is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥,2
How's he got away with that going for 1,1
IPL final should be in Sharjah,2
What even is a safe total in Sharjah??,3
Nokia gonna bowl a tight over,2
Anything below 20 easily gettable in last over,2
Rahul is on 30 of 12,1
"Even if kkr gets 10 runs here, they can win it",2
I can't believe kg went for 50,1
Bring on all the non believers. Captain 17 sixes Morgan will teach you never to doubt him. Ever.,3
Was just about to sleep. Just saw the score. Wtf is happening? Lol,3
That last over of Delhi innings coming back to bite as I knew it would,3
This is like the RCB MI match,3
Suddenly it seems very manageable. No thanks to brain dead captaincy.,8
Stoinis for final over?!,5
Stoinis is gonna bowl the last over,6
A 220+ score was not chased down in 12 years of IPL. It might get chase down twice in a week now.,6
"Who will bowl last over? Harshal, Stoinis or Mishraji?",2
Nortjes pronounced Nokia?,3
okay pitch is road but still Quality of cricket is unreal this IPL,1
This is absolutely fire. If KKR can bring it home,2
That last over by Dre Rus looks so good in hindsight.,4
If you didn't love Morgan in his 2016 WC form you don't deserve to love him in his current form,11
Last over Stoinis or Ashwin?,4
DK is a nice guy. Too nice. Someone even stole his wife.,7
So basically you need to give the batting side a Required Run Rate of greater than 36 in the last 5 to be safe,3
Ponting concentrating on finishing his homework while everyone else is busy with the game,8
DK's beard is sick.,3
DC got just 7 runs in the final over.,5
3d chess by Karthik to keep the best batsman at the last. Y'all just don't get it,5
I have no sympathy left for DK. Not anymore. He's done.,8
Two good balls,1
Got busy with Leeds-City but how tf have they choked this?,1
Looking a little tight here,2
how many full tosses? counted at least 10 in the last 3 overs. all knee high too,1
My poor heart can’t take thisss anymore... I just want a straightforward win,3
Morgan wicket here plz god 🙏,3
DK should definitely get sacked now,4
Nortje has bowled better than Rabada this match..,4
CSKs notes are already full.,3
nortje will win the match for dc,4
Nortje reminds me of Allan Donald for some reason,2
Just make Morgan the Captain please,7
Nokia>>>>>>Rabada,2
"If they get 10 more in the over, 19 of Mishra or Ashwin can easily be done.",3
We need to leave 20+ in last.,3
Plot twist,2
OUT ☹️,3
India scored 240 vs West Indies in the t20 at Wankhede at the end of last year. I'd say someone is getting past 250 at Sharjah this season.,2
Praise the fucking lord for Nokia.,3
"WHO WILL BOWL THE FINAL OVER? A SPINNER?
OR STOINIS?",3
The past few overs have been a masterclass of how to fuck up yorkers,1
Nokia gonna do a Navdeep Saini?,2
A smaller ground and that would have been a six,4
OH NO,2
"This is the over I guess, atleast 14 from this over",2
Gg all.... Will see you all next match.,4
Nokia you beauty .....,4
Fuck,4
RIP,3
So basically Nokia>>>Rabada,8
With Rabadas figures ruined yuzi still holds the purple cap,7
Fuck,1
"Nokia is fucking good, absolute bargain for the money",8
Aw man,2
GG,3
Nokia > Rabada obviously,8
Nortje you beauty!!,2
I'll suck you off nortje,5
NOKIIAAAAAAAAAAAA FJSLAALDKEOMA,7
Oh noooooo 😭,2
90 sixes in 3 matches!! WTF!!,3
HOW WAS THIS GUY SENT IN AT 8,3
"Kaif writing ""Lag Gaye BC""",1
Every run Eoin scores....and he's out....is a nail in DK's coffin,5
Ugh... great innings tho Eoin,2
Specialist fielder to the rescue!!!,2
Good effort Morgs. No one can blame you for trying.,2
It's over now,2
Imagine if Morgan played 8 more balls,3
It’s over,2
Hetmyer our crunch catcher strikes again.,2
This ground is ridiculous in terms of entertainment.,3
Finally Morgan's out,3
"I love to see ponting like this.

Zoom at little bit more.",3
"Yes yes yes, fuckn yess..

But, Well done Morgan, now go and kick DK's butt for his moronic Captaincy..",8
"For once his life, Hetmyer grabbed something useful",3
"**18.3** Nortje to Morgan, OUT,  **200-7**

EJG Morgan c Hetmyer b Nortje 44 (18b 1x4 5x6) SR: 244.44",2
"Well played Morgan, gave hope to KKR again",6
Well played Morgan!!!,7
Noooooooooo,7
Thodi der ke liye goti muh me tha.,3
Nagarkoti’s Biryani going to come in clutch,8
"Ah well, that’s the game. But KKR didn’t deserve a win anyway with that batting order.",5
DK cursed Morgan there,10
Nagarkoti's time to shine baby,2
"Oh Nortje, you beauty, winning the match for DC with your bowling and fielding",1
Its Delhi’s game now,1
Tripathi can still do this,2
Nortje doing what Rabada couldn't do,1
[deleted],2
Only one to blame here is DK no one else,4
Pogba with the all important catch,5
Nokia 🤝,4
Game over,2
Morgan should have come at 4 now Russell would have been batting with an over from Ashwin or Stoinis.,3
Specialist fielder Hetmyer,3
Very well played Morgan.,8
They definitely need a Tripathia now,1
If only they used their brains and didn't fuck with the batting order 😒,3
Nokia is quality,1
chris woakes opting out is the best thing he's done to DC,1
Morgan should have come in earlier. Sending him below 5 is brain dead captaincy,3
aww shit. we couldve had a close on yall.,2
~~nokia~~ Nortje 🤝 connecting ~~people~~  wickets.,7
Can nagarkoti bat?,2
"It’s blowing my mind, who the fuck would choose DK for captain over Morgan, what the fuck??",1
This guy got Russell and Morgan. MVP for me,0
Crossed over or no?,1
Morgan is love 😍,2
Beware DC.. Nagarkoti Time..,1
wow.. how good Nortje has been for DC today.. that catch.. top fielding efforts and this with his bowling..,2
Morgan to bat 8 next match. Shameful innings,9
hetyy specialist catcher,3
Imagine if Morgan didn’t get out,0
Nokia 3310 reliable as always!,3
"Fuck. Hope this match brings some sense into the management. STOP DRAGGING THE CLUB INTO GROUND. Tripathi starts with Gill from next match. DK comes before Cumm, Morgan at 4.",9
"Kaif: Dear diary, goti muh me tha.",5
Scenes if Nagarkoti pulls off Tiwatia,4
"What's a safe score in Sharjah tho? 300?

KKR would've won this with some better captaincy. It's not DC'S fault tho. It's the ground.",13
How many 'DK is done Morgan needs to be captain' comments do we have today?,8
"Now im not saying Dk is shit, but if you look at that scorecard He is the difference between the two sides",3
"No matter how much you fall, nokia does not break.",6
Why Cummings came before Tripathi again?,11
Morgan has been a very good LO player last couple of years,9
When is KKR getting rid of Narine and Karthik?,3
Bc kitna full tosses !,3
How does ponting sit through this,3
"If only Morgan was sent up the order, but now we can only think over what ifs",7
"Not your first choice but delivering anyway


Nortje 🤝 Nokia",13
Can't win now,3
"Bowl Ashwin next, if u bowl Stoinis I will kill u Iyer",3
DC to win this by 13 runs,3
[deleted],9
Nagarkoti has a free hit now tho. Go big or go home,3
"Nortje's bowling shit here, how's he getting away with these",3
"Dc fans be like : Ek dum se waqt badal diya, zazbat badal diye, zindagi badal di, ooo bhai maro mujhe maro",4
Even if after this KKR continue to fuck over Morgan it will be shambolic management,8
"Nokia and Harshal doing a Rabada today. Lol, weird sport",2
This ground is ridiculous,1
Why is rahane in the field?,1
Dead fielding...,3
Good give him a single now,1
Don’t overestimate any bowler in Sharjah. Everyone was hyping Rabada and touting him as a reason KKR won’t win,3
Ah man those full tosses,3
Ethical mind fucked up here,4
That misfield kinda sus,5
Irrfan tweets Dhoni should retire. and praising him in commentary DAFAQ😒,1
Ashwin doing Torres level fielding.,1
What a clutch over from Nokia.,2
Lol what the hell was that,3
Good midfield,2
I still love rabada,3
Ethical mind abusing,1
Feeling sad for Ashwin....bowled only 1 over.,2
Anything even would be acceptable in this final delivery I guess.,2
Why does DK keep on messing with the batting order. I think KKR could've had a way netter chance had they played Russell later. Narine can't open anymore as well.,1
Nortje wasn't even picked in the auction & bowling than purple cao holder here,2
Imagine if Morgan was batting up and Russell was there to finish now.,4
"Not a bad result!! 

Keep Tripathi away from strike.",2
Irrfan tweets Dhoni should retire. and praising him in commentary DAFAQ😒,6
Delhi Capitals must be thanking their gods for the 2 quality overseas death bowler they have when most teams don't even have a single one,6
I went to take a dump. Came back and this had happened,1
"Nortje is very impressive , he won the match for DC",3
Ashwin saying Ben Stokes lol,4
"Tripathi should have opened instead of Narine, I don't understand the logic behind Karthik's move, this game would be a different story otherwise",4
TACTICAL MISFIELD,8
Lol Ashwin wants to remind everyone he's still playing m,5
How is that pronounced as nokia. Weird,4
Ashwin mama spouting Delhi abuses aa,4
Who will ball last over stionis or Mishra ji?,2
Unethical fielding,3
Karthik should take responsibility if they lose.,7
"Ashwin does not like normal run outs, it seems",2
Ethical piece of fielding right there Bois.,2
what the hell was that Ashwin?,1
[KKR Vs Nokia](https://ibb.co/Mfv86XV),9
"Well, this is interesting.",1
Ashwin just said MC. That's Delhi effect I guess.,6
cmon now ethical mind... swearing is not the way of the ethical kind,3
Ashwin thinking of the title for his next youtube video.,7
This MISTAKE in the field in these conditions is probably the signal to bookies. /s,4
"When Ash says MC/BC, it’s so nice to see",8
Will we see the youtuber dude bowling the last over?,3
"ETHICAL

FIELDING",10
Did Ashwin just call himself a behenchod?,5
Unethical misfield by Ashwin,1
"Ok 26 left, surely not??????",2
25 left for super over,1
Bowl Stoinis. It’s fine.,4
Ashwin didn’t even fully extend to reach for the ball. Look at the replay and tell me it’s not intentional lmao,6
26 off 6 let's go,2
This script needs a strong plot armor to make it to super over,2
Nokia goddamn finished the match,2
"Tactical misfield

Edit: of course it was Ashwin",4
Invaluable over by Nortje there. Kudos,9
5 RUN OVER!,2
are all sharjah matches going to be this close... fucking hell,2
"Tripathi refusing the single. Liking this dude already. As the line in The Replacements goes ""Winners want the ball.""",4
4D play by Ashwin there. GG.,3
Even Nagarkoti is batting more sensibly than Karthik and Narine.,4
"Nokia is pretty good, eh?",4
Tripathi should open from now on,6
Why does Morgan bat so low. Just because DK is Indian doesn't mean he can bat before Morgan.,9
8 runs too many to ask. Let's see.,3
Come on Stoinis. 4 6s.,1
Ok what is this nokia things you guys are referring to? Someone explain pls,2
"5 runs and a wicket. In teh context of the modern t20 game, and IPL 2020 in particular, this over was absolutely godly",1
Glad the other SA pacer didn’t choked,1
What is stopping them from hitting 26 off Stoinis? Rabada went for 23.,4
"Nokia(Brand) be like, friendship ended with KKR  
Now DC is my best friend",2
Karthik please drop the captaincy like gambhir did last year.,4
"Not in the loop, lol. What is this ethical thing?!",1
If they get 25 there can be a superover,2
No ball and a six would set it up nicely,2
4 sixes and a single for super over. Not happening,3
dk's beard is really well maintained. only nice thing i can muster for him rn.,9
Destroy the greek god now,2
Wait...is Brendon McCullum in kkr management?,1
Penultimate overs are more important than final overs in chases. That was excellent,6
Spinner in the last over = anything is chaseable in this garden,3
Why isn't Shaw on the field?,2
What happened to Shaw?,2
Should have been a six this one,2
Reverse Stoinks,2
"BC why Marcus.... this is on par with DK's captaincy

Edit - I am so sorry Mr Hulk I doubted you.",4
Couldve given it to Mishra lmao,1
Someone teach Stoinis to fuckn pitch the ball..,2
Holy shit not Stoinis lmao wtf,1
See KKR that's why you give 19th over to a pacer,3
I still feel it's a bit unfair that DC has two of the best fast bowlers in this tournament.,4
Superover,3
Morgan should be higher up in the order,3
Fuck offf iyer,2
KKR's middle order wasn't overhyped,4
"lol exactly what was needed.

Slats is dumbo, we'll gladly take 6 4's",2
Welp!! Tripathi is batting on different planet!,4
You know KKR could have probs won this if they've sent Morgan in much sooner. Swap Russel and Morgan's batting positions and you've got a winning combination,4
Nvm,1
Stoinis pls,2
Cmon Big Dick Marcus!!!,5
Why is Shaw not fielding?,1
Damn,3
DC’s last over was poor show from Stoinis and Hetmyer,2
And that's game,2
"He isn’t just any Nortje, he’s Nortje 3310",3
"Oh yeah.. game, set, match!",2
Fucking nice,1
What a ball,3
What a fucking good yorker.,3
Stoinis to bowl some pies,2
Should have put Ashwin in there. He may have gotten some run outs,6
Hell yeah Boi,1
Tripathi take my energy 🔥🔥,2
good bowling there from Stoinis.,3
Similar to yesterday’s match this,2
That's it then... Final nail in the coffin.,3
At least KKR got the NRR sorted,6
"Uh Stoinis with the 20th is interesting to say the least

Edit: Should've known better than to doubt the hulk",1
Brilliant ball under pressure. Amazing.,5
Beautiful bowled! Wow,5
"Holy shit, we're done",2
"Stoinis giveth, Stoinis taketh",10
Poor guy,1
I stand corrected,2
ARgghhgh Ohhhhh Yeahah daddyy Yeess Yess Dadddyyyy !! Stoinis you KING,4
stoinis 6 full tosses out of the last 7 balls. shit,1
Stoinis bby never doubted you,3
ARgghhgh Ohhhhh Yeahah daddyy Yeess Yess Dadddyyyy !! Stoinis you KING,3
Fuck me Marcus,2
DC best entertainers of IPL,5
Tripathi played goddamn well,9
Start pitching the bowl in the fucking pitch Stoinis,3
At least I'm happy that Tripathi got to prove himself and would hopefully replace Narine position,13
"Good ball, gash shot",5
Brilliant delivery Stoin,6
That yorker was fireeee,6
Serving humble pies,2
"fuck me in the ass and call me sherly, stoinis you beauty",6
Okay sorry stoinis,3
I eat my words.,3
Beautiful bowling by Stoinis!!,1
Not your fault Tripathi. Your captain is shit,10
"36 from 16 from the opener, after the captain sends him at Number 8, well done Tripathi",8
Yeah fuck off KKR!,2
Sto??????i????nis???????,2
Stoinis is a last over specialist,7
Stoinis the mannis,3
"Finally, after all those full tosses, Stoinis got one right.",3
"Hopefully, KKR will have Tripathi opening and Morgan batting at no. 4 from the next match. Would be a more balanced lineup that way.",7
Let this guy open KKR,5
Delhi stoinis is in reality what Australia stoinis is in Warne's imagination,11
Cash transfer by srk failed,9
Need a no ball here for KKR to win,2
Good innings this from Tripathi. Nailed it,3
Nokia man of match just for that 19th over.,3
"It's OK, Tripathy. You are the BOSS! Well played.
Hope the KKR think tank learns their lesson",7
Tripathi bats 11 next game and karthik opens,6
Rahane going from captain last season to specialist fielder this season.,10
[deleted],5
"DK will still let Narine open, and waste Tripathi",7
Lmao Shaw looks like he's 40 years old,3
Should have played it straighter,1
16 ball 36,3
Atleast Tripathi tried. Well done. Its not your fault your captain is brain-dead.,11
Now watch DK drop him next match,2
Maybe kkr have learned from this and make tripathi open next match,5
Excellent innings from Tripathi,3
Mc fat k 4 ho gyi thi. Top of the table... DC BC nacho bc.,3
This loss is on DK,3
That was a class yorker.,3
Hhheeee yaaaa,1
Can Shivam Mavi bat?,2
I’m 100% sure this is all dk’s fault somehow,4
Wonder what CSK think looking at these chases in Sharjah.,1
"Absolute joke management, none of this is on Morgan or Tripathi",8
"**19.2** Stoinis to Tripathi, OUT, that's the game then. Dipping yorker at 126ks, and it squeezes under Tripathi's swing to dislodge the off stump **207-8**

RA Tripathi  b Stoinis 36 (16b 3x4 3x6) SR: 225.00",1
Tripathi played incredibly well. The batting positions fucked KKR chances,2
"PETITION TO REPLACE RUPEES WITH ""*STOINCOIN ©*""",8
Where's Cummins?,2
Nice effort by Morgan and tripathi there. Almost pulled it off,2
"There can only be one Tewatia I guess, but valiant effort Tripathi, it’s such a shame DK is a bit shit",5
Tripathi and Gill should open from next match.,3
Given his form DK isn't even good enough to be in the 11 smh,5
"Who is that lady in white from KKR camp, asking for a friend.",6
I swear IPL is gonna be the death of me in the form of a heart attack one day.,5
Prithvi shaw is the most weird looking man/boy I’ve seen in cricket,10
No boundary here and gg,3
How is it have shit international players are awesome IPL players and shit IPL players are awesome international players,5
[deleted],9
Obligatory DK is shit comment,16
Fantastic effort from Tripathi and Morgan. Now DK should get his head out of his ass and send them at 1 & 4 respectively in the next matches.,18
MaviKoti on the job.,3
Lol at DC fans celebrating barely winning after they should have won by 100 runs,5
Shaw looks like childhood version of Ravi Shastri,19
"Fuck off Stoinis, no shit you got the yorker right after attempting it like 10 times and bowling pies",6
"Tripathi man, first match of the IPL and almost got KKR home",17
In before: Tripathi and Morgan dropped for not being able to close the match,19
[deleted],12
"Talk about backing your bowlers

Good shit Iyer",11
Cmon Marcus bowl a no ball,7
Now don't ball no fucking no balls.,4
GG,3
What this match tells you is 210 or so is a par score here. Crazy,13
KKR lost it when they sent Cummo above Rahul,15
Daily remainder that Eoin Morgan should play at 4,12
Mission NRR rescue accomplished.,6
"DK BAD



now give me upvotes",11
"Take me to the log cabin, Stoinis daddy",8
Sheeghra-Dhawan quickly releasing the ball from outfield,2
Shaw’s had a bit too many of soluchans,4
Iyer will get man of the match but it really should be Nortje,8
"Cameraman panning on hot girls so that KKR fans forget the pain.


Also *who dat chick?*",13
"Remember the time when India gave up 6 consecutive sixes (or maybe it was 4 sixes) a few years ago and lost the game what was supposed to be an easy win from a high run total??

Yeah I still have ptsd from it",3
Key question is why isnt shaw fielding,6
DK getting all the hate is rightly deserved. He messed up the batting order so bad.,28
Not the best last over for either batting team.,7
*prime csk flashbacks*,5
Lol at people who wanted iyer to bowl a spinner instead of stonnis on this wicket,9
"That was extremely timely from Nortje and Stoinis, match was slipping away and they pulled it back",9
"In case any CSK fans are watching, this is how you play for NRR. What an effort by KKR",13
Back on top of the table baby... Well played!,8
"That hurt our NRR a lot, so little disappointing",3
I've played cricket a lot and that diving/rolling business still fascinates me. I'd probably break in two pieces if I tried that though,11
20 off 1... Easy for Mavi...,11
CLUTCH fielder Dhawan,4
Can we please go back to DK and his tuk tuk innings ?,9
BC other guys are putting so much effort and look at the useless Karthik on ther hand. Idk why but everytime I see him I feel like slapping him.,7
Marcus Aurelius in the death,7
Tripathi might not be the hero today but he has already shown DK to be the villain.,11
"Funny how even remotely good captaincy would have won this. Not letting a spinner bowl in the depth vs Iyer, not sending Russell that early, not sending Morgan in at 6, not opening with Narine and with Tripathi instead. Terrible captaincy, this game had so many decisions that were the worst I’ve witnessed tbh.",17
"I literally said “just take a wicket, spice things up” and Stoinis came through 🥺",4
Hotstar on fire TV sucks.. bsdk can't even make fucking usable App.,8
Feel so cross with KKR's management/captaincy even as a neutral. Imagine the actual fans.,19
Anyone who took part in Dream 11 Mega Contest. What's the top points now?,0
"Came here after a long time, fuck you DC for nrr boosting dreams..",10
What an effort from Morgan and Tripathi. The biggest fuck you to the management. Their passion to win was very apparent.,39
17th 18th overs of the second inning have been expensive,11
So it took KKR to break Rabada's 2 wicket streak,12
Fuck this. Tactical blunders hurt KKR's chase. Morgan would have closed the chase with 2 overs to spare.,19
"Cannot fathom the thought process of Dk above Morgan, but I have to assume they’re high",11
"Stoned-nis now fully stoned. 

Only a fully stoned Stoinis could bowl that yorker",7
"This is all on that idiot Dinesh. Useless order, 5 of 6, spinner to bowl 19th, Thripati  ignored.",13
"KKR should go with this lineup for the rest of the tournament.

1) Tripathi

2) Gill

3) Rana

4) Morgan

5) DK/Russell

6) Russell/DK

7) Cummins

8) Narine/Green

9) Mavi

10) Nagarkoti

11) Chakravarthy",17
Even the Big Biceps looks exhausted.. top hot there..,4
3 sixes short,5
Rabada you may unclench now,11
20 runs too many boys .... lol,10
Back on top!,6
Anriche Nortje appreciation post.,8
Stupid sexy Stoinis,4
He called them mumbai lmaooo,3
Nortje won them that tbh,13
Catching has been outstanding in this match!! Have to give props for that.,4
Can't wait for Ponting's dress room talk now!!,7
F Yes DC! Good going!,2
Both the IPLs conducted outside India won by DC,14
"Won't deny, thodi der ke liye goti muh mein tha!",9
"KKR really shit the bed in the bowling department here , DC bowled solid ,executed their plans well.

Batting order was all over the place as well.",4
This IPL has quite a few Naibs - captains who are passengers.....,8
A good almost comeback type script,3
We win,2
FUCK DINESH KARTHIK,5
DK should play at 6. Much better as a finisher,2
Yo... Dilli... Top of the charts l,7
This might seem foolish. But this loss came as a boon for KKR. Tripathi can now open. Morgan will go up the order. And DK can play where he belongs @7 saving Nrr when all hope is lost. *Today I concede that DK wasn't unlucky. He never had that *it* factor in him. I wanted a fairytale ending to his career but I think he has gotten more than he deserves.,28
KKR scored 210 though,6
Nortje what a match for him,5
DK gotta own up,6
"Nortje for MOTM. Catches, cluth bowling, fielding.",4
"Don't feel as bad losing to DC, they're a solid team. Hopefully this loss prompts some changes in the batting department.",8
Narine as opener needs to go. Tripathi to open.. morgan and Russell to come before dk.,6
KKR came close to winning but we managed to turn it around,4
Nortje for MOM ward please. Also Hetmeyer playing as a specialist fielder is so good.,7
DK piss poor captaincy to blame for the loss,9
"Nortje and Harshal, thank you",7
[deleted],14
Goti muh me aa gayi thodi Der ke liye lmfao,3
RUSSELL WAS IN AT 4 FOR ABSOLUTELY NO REASON.,12
Nortje saved the match imo. Imagine 18th over going for 23. Then bowling the 19th over and only giving 5 runs plus a wicket.,20
DK batting at 5 with Morgan at 6 is peak captains benefits,9
Well played boys! Be glad your Sharjah duel is over. I think kkr faces rcb here again.,8
DK showed INTENT & that's all that matters /s,8
If I were Baz then I'd drop Marine for Banton. Open him with Gill and play Tripathi in DK's place.,4
"This was chaseable, this loss is on McCullum and DK for shitting the bed with the batting order.",10
Nortje for motm. But they will give it to Iyer.,7
"Closer than I would've liked, but I'll take it",8
"This was KKR’s game. 

Reasons for losing-

- 19th over to Varun
- Opening with Narine
- Sending Russ before Morgan
- Sending DK before Tripathi",17
Are we first on the points table now?,13
Rcb loses 1st place :(,14
"Both my back bencher teams for a decade, topping table!!

Sweet",18
Do captains have that much hold over the batting order? Just asking . Always assumed that management has a hand in this... captain kinda executes,9
"dk should be a man and do what’s good for the team, handover the captaincy to morgan and hope morgan lets him keep his place as the wicketkeeper.",13
A ground with 217 average score should make the haters think that it did not matter how DC won this game. The point was to win on this small ass field.,9
Should they make Morgan the captain?,11
I'm glad KKR losr so now they can finally sort out their issues,7
"Entertaining match atleast, cricket won at the end of the day 🤣",9
KKR don't deserve to win with that jersey-captain combo.,15
It’s criminal that your best batsman only faces 18 balls in a chase of 220+,31
Ponting going to make Rabada and Stoinis bowl with a wet soap in the nets.,26
Nortje rescued the game for DC. Sounds mad but Morgan and Tripathi were chasing that down if he hadn’t picked up Morgan.,23
"I said near the start that DC has the best team.

I feel validated",14
"Wtf are you roaring at .. tigers are nowhere near Delhi ..they would die of pollution anyway ... 

Ironically bengal has a bunch ..",7
At one point I thought that KKR was gonna win but damn,9
The match vs Punjab and this... not good signs,9
Will change of captaincy help kkr? Or is there someone else in the non playing staff making these decisions?,4
"People asking for dropping Narine should realize that Russell is not reliable enough to complete his 4 overs everytime. I also think that Kkr batting is pretty solid, just the order was wrong today.
Gill

Tripathi

Rana

Morgan

Russell/DK

Russell/DK

Narine

Cummins",9
"All out of place batsmen just wasted deliveries. 

Narine at the top, DK in the middle and then fucking Cummins before Trpathi.",11
It was a great game. Enjoyed watching Morgan and Tripathi though sadly couldn't take their team over the finish line.,8
It's DK's turn to be a social media meme,14
Even as a Delhi fan I got caught up in Kolkata's chase! That's the beauty of cricket. Fun fun match.,9
I don't feel like DK is going to change anything!,13
Love how dk is not taking the blame.,6
i really like the guy. but dk needs to take some tough calls if he wants kkr to have a shot at playoff.,11
[deleted],12
Seeing the last 5 overs gave me a good anxiety attack. Good show KKR,7
HGFKFJHFJGBJFGHGSUVFTBJ,8
So who's gonna be the man of the match?,2
Went to sleep after Rana was dismissed. How the FUCK did we get this close?,1
Why do kkr persist on sending Narine to open? It's just brain-dead decision making,12
Commentator giving DK all the pointers.,9
"Haven't thought about it, what is this DK smoking!",11
What do u mean you haven't thought about pushing narine down the order yet dk wtf I m so mad.,10
"DK - Yeah we lost but we did everything well...

Doesn't work like that bud",11
438 in 40 overs. Man this ground and this pitch is something so different,14
I never for a second doubted that we would defend this total. not even a second.,6
Don't shit on DK. He wants the management to make Morgan the captain. He is trying hard to prove it.,24
Pretty good effort from the Iceman and  Tripathi. Fell short by a few in the end. Hard luck KKR. Well played DC.,15
Okay now KKR has no reason not to make Morgan captain because he is always selected after that innings.,16
Morgan should have come in sooner. I still don't get why kkr insist on playing him so far down the order.,13
"Delhi on the top of the points table, thanks 2020",11
That Nidahas innings has got into his head,12
KKR needs to push Narine down the order and open with Tripathi,15
Can someone explain why Narine is in top order?,13
Its a pity that an extremely talented batsman like Rahul Tripathi who proved himself in earlier seasons as an opener cannot get a decent run at the position where he performed. Its a failure of the team management and the captain.,21
"Forget about his captaincy, Katrthik hasn't played well in any of the matches in the tournament.",14
Which language is nortje speaking?,6
At least NRR wasn't fucked. Boy this ground scares me. What are we gonna do tomorrow?,15
Nortje has been such a great replacement. Woakes please be unavailable the next season also xoxo,6
nortjes interview reminds me of my job interview.,6
"When did the Mumbai legend Abhishek Nayar join the KKR coaching staff?

Figures, since Karthik's sudden resurgence a couple of years back was due to Nayar putting him through his unique training regime.",6
[deleted],19
"I get that it didn't work out but why are people complaining about Russell coming in early, isn't that what everyone was clamoring for for so long?",15
We're number one on points table,13
"I don't feel bad losing to Delhi. They are the best team in the tournament. Happy we scored 210

Still think KKR is good enough to qualify for the play-offs.

Narine is clearly a burden now. Can't bat and bowled 2 overs. If required, can drop him for Banton.

Hope DK gets back in form in the next couple of innings. Otherwise after 6 games, it will be gard to argue why he should be in the playing 11.",28
"Narine opening was a gamble and after the first half of the 2017 season, teams figured him out. Cramp him up and bowl short. KKR go back to regular opener please.",15
"I've honestly felt bad for DK because he was ignored a lot. But I don't anymore. He's been very very selfish this season so far. Coming ahead of Morgan when he knows Morgan is a much better batsman and in form. That's very selfish, putting yourself ahead of your team. Fuck you mate.",26
"Should they have flipped Morgan & Russel in batting order? Also, why send Cummin at that slot?",9
Can Tripathi keep?,15
DC and RCB at the top of the table ...lol,6
Thought KKR's batting order would collapse but they still managed to come close,8
[deleted],12
"Nortje Motm surely. Great catch, great bowling, great fielding, did not bat.",19
Happy to see Tripathi making good use of the opportunity he got. He was good at RPS but hasn't received enough chances since then.,29
"bating order should be- tripathi,gill,rana,morgan,kartik,russel,narain,cummins,nagorkoti,mavi,chacravarti",24
How’d they reach so close without a proper partnership,14
When 200 runs is just not enough... smh,11
Can't believe DC RCB are in the top 4 and CSK's last,20
DC could have hurt KKR's NRR a lot more today.,26
DC and RCB in the top 2. CSK in the bottom. If anything summarised 2020 it was this.,28
"For the next game, make Morgan the captain, open with Tripathi and play Narine & Karthik at 10 & 11.",32
"Narine is an opener because Gambhir used him there to whack opponents using gentle medium pace or spinners at the top, it continued to work in CPL against average bowlers, it will never work in a million years against 90 Miles/hr quick bowlers like Rabada and Nortje",67
If only Dhoni had as much confidence that DK has promoting himself up the order.,46
"I think pant has flown below the radar again today, very valuable contribution today. He is being consistent unlike some else *cough*samson*cough*",41
"Rather than asking who should be captain , it's time to ask do Dinesh Karthik deserve to be in playing 11.",24
"Can somebody please explain why was Cummins sent before Tripathi? I mean, what was the team management thinking?",37
Only thing that hasn't changed is SRH grabbing onto to the 4th spot like every year,28
“I always play well against Bengalis whether it is Bangladesh or Kolkata”- Dinesh Karthik,38
"DK out- Banton in
Narine out- Kuldeep in
With Eoin Morgan captaining the side.
I might get a lot of hate for this comment..",41
"When it comes to batting, Morgan is far far better than DK is in every single facet. He anchors the innings better, strikes the ball harder, scores at a much higher rate, finishes the game more often. It’s a two brain cell decision to come to bat before morgan on any given day, let alone when chasing 229.",29
Kartik and narine are passengers in that batting line up,23
Be back tomorrow afternoon for another findest from Sharjah. The mums and kids would love it.,20
Seemed like Nortje was giving a job interview.,19
Just realised KKR won the toss and elected to bowl ಠ︵ಠ,24
Anyone gonna help me with Top points on Dream11 Mega Contest today?,1
"Can Banton keep?

Somebody reply!",15
"Lots of batting fireworks and Iyer is likely to get the MotM, well deserved too, but need to underscore Nortje and Harshal's contributions here. Going at ~8 and taking 5 wickets between them at Sharjah was pure gold.

DC should experiment with Carey in place of Hetmyer. I feel they lack consistent lower order big hitters. Carey looks the part and Hetmyer looks out of sorts.

Even Stoinis at 5 is a little out of position but looking at their roster, there aren't many options. Keemo Paul is another option but he's still really new to IPL scene.",24
In Sharjah bowlers should get Participation Certificates and Hardship Allowances.,59
DK should sit with the coaching staff to discuss a replacement for himself,59
[removed],25
The Narine opening thing has to come to an end. They need someone to open with Gill. Either Tripathi or Banton  need to come even if it means Narine sits out. I'd say give a few chances more to Nagarkti/Mavi buyt they seem inconsistent. Sandeep Warrier and Prasidh were pretty good at one stage in terms of economy. Cummins has been inconsistent with the ball too,15
"If Banton for Narine works, calls will be there for DK to drop himself cuz Banton can keep as well",34
Lol cricbuzz commentary has Iyer saying 'Winning was icing on the cake.' Is he saying his innings was the cake and the team's win was the icing?,26
"Criticisms are fair, but I think we should also remember that we are talking about some guys who are special talents (1 in 10 million) who have worked really hard to get where they are. But yeah, they make mistakes, like the rest of us. Think of the time you did something stupid or were stuck in a rut and nothing seemed to work.",21
Everyone was unnecessarily harsh on RCB’s death bowling all these years. They literally play half their matches at Chinnaswamy,32
KKR bowling was so bad. Cummins was the most disappointing to me. Karthik and Narine should justify their position.,18
DC on top and CSK at the bottom. I thought I would never see it in my lifetime. Long may it last!,24
"If Shaw is injured, Delhi will be closer to finding their best XI:

Stoinis
Dhawan
Rahane
Iyer
Pant
Axar
Sams
Ashwin
Rabada
Nortje
Mishra

4 fast bowling option, 3 spinning options. Never chasing more than 150-160 which that batting line up will handle easily on most days.",-12
Do you guys agree that RCB would have done a lot better if they have not played at Chinnaswamy all these years? All teams bowling like shit at Sharjah made me realise that.,17
To everyone asking why they sent Cummins before Tripathi it’s a Indian thing guys... they spent 15 crores on Cummins and they want to make it worth ever penny no matter if you lose or win the match. :P,13
KKR's Russel flopped lmao,1
