Letszooooo,6
Let's gooooooooooooooo boisss,2
Atb fans. Hope one y'all win the title,8
Very neutral as an MI fan today. But I had predicted an MI vs DC final last year itself when CSK beat DC in the Q2. So let's see,4
Almost time to find out if the pain gets prolonged til Tuesday or finally ends today.,11
Saha pleaaaase,7
"So finally its here, absolutely terrified. Its either gonna be the ending of Infinity War or Endgame",7
"I'm just numb today. Having supported this Delhi side since the IPL began, it's just endless disappointment over and over.

I was at the ground when we lost by 146 runs. The humiliation over the second half of this season doesn't faze me. Today's inevitable loss will just be another page in the Delhi tragedy novel.

Just get it over with man. Just get it over with.",7

Let's fight it out over who gets to be crushed by the Mumbai Juggernaut in a couple days time!,4
Delhi fans have entered full reverse jinx mode after that MI defeat and now Im all paranoid cuz that’s the tactic we used to sneak into the playoffs. MI y u gotta beat em so hard ?,15
I’m still wondering how the hell did we make it to the penultimate match of the tournament? My mind still hasn’t sunk this in after that KXIP game.,36
"DC are like wounded lions now, they gonna crush us real hard.",11
"supporting DC today, just incase we lose atleast DC gets their first trophy",10
"btw go check jonny bairstow insta stories, rain was pelting down",4
"Honestly, as a dc fan, I am content with what  the boys have done. The DC team is simply not experienced enough to win games in crunch situations as it happened against MI, as far as batting is concerned. Neither are they led by a legendary player (like Shane Warne for RR 2008) . Plus SRH has such nice guys playing for them that I would not mind if they end up winning today against my first choice side. At least then the finals will be interesting to watch!",3
STH are into reverse jinx mode again.,2
"Okay so on a side note, I read and research vedic astrology as a hobby. A lot of bogus going on in the name of astrology nowadays, but if genuinely studied with pure intentions in a non profitable manner then it can be quite helpful.

So I was seeing Kohli's Sun and Moon charts for this and the next year, and what surprised me is that the end of 2020 and the whole of 2021 is potentially supposed to be the best years of Kohli as a captain. There are extremely high chances of him winning a cup for his team, almost guaranteed you can say, which is rare to see in anything in astrology. However my guess is only one trophy, since I don't think his individual performances will be so great. But his captaincy is gonna be top notch and a lot of luck factor. Good news for Rcb fans/Indian fans. I would prefer the World t20 cup over IPL trophy though. 

Would want him to prove me wrong by performing really well as well 🤞",-4
"* Stoinis
* Dhawan
* Rahane
* Iyer
* Pant
* Hetmyer
* Axar
* Harshal/Tushar
* Rabada
* Ashwin
* Nortje

My 11 for DC today arranged according to their batting no

&#x200B;

What y'all think?",6
I swear SRH fans come early to the match threads only to reverse jinx their team.,21
Have a strong feeling Stoinis is gonna open alongside Dhawan today,17
No amount of reverse jinxing gonna work today SRH,27
In B4 everyone jinx the fuck outta us.,5
Ashwin vs Warner would be a great contest in the powerplay,4
Dhawan century today?,0
"Dhawan, Stoinis, Iyer, Rahane, Pant, Hetmyer, A Patel, H Patel, Ashwin, Rabada, Nortje

I'd go with this",1
Comments section rn is which side can out-reverse-jinx the other.,7
"I genuinely think we can go with the same squad for the next season, addition of Roy and Woakes just to round it off. But this is a solid squad for Kotla matches or even if it happens here also again. Form of Pant, Shaw, Iyer was a let down but otherwise not many faults tbh",4
Guys instead of dropping Shaw why not drop Rahane and play Shaw in the middle order. He can atleast attack the spinners.,5
"You're being listened to whether you want it or not. Is that unsettling, or reassuring?",4
"The only reason I wanna see SRH lose today is because the ""reverse jinx"" strategy it's fan use is so overused and unfunny.

If they win like this, these fans will never stop reverse jinxing. All the following IPLs we'll have to read these unfunny comments.

Nothing against Kanos and Warner though. Really wanna see both of them get a 50 today!!

PS- I know other teams also have fans who use reverse jinxing but they have already lost.",-12
I'm rooting for literally anyone except MI,46
I have no clue what this lady presenter's accent is supposed to be.,9
"We were happily enjoying the underdog status, none of the so called ""experts"" even gave us a chance or even thought we will qualify for playoffs. Now all the other fans(doing it with good intentions?) started calling us as the only team who can give tough fight to MI. Amidst all this chaos, it's fans like me with reverse jinxing (we have our sentiments Bois) need to up the ante and step up for our Bois today.",27
Can't wait for Warner to win the toss yet again,10
MI fans seeing everyone rooting for anyone except them: It's lonely at the top,4
"Jinx, reverse-jinx, or no jinx, or whatever for that matter, SRH is probably gonna win this based on the side they can field in this match. Topic is over!! 😒",-1
"What do you guys think about the chances of Lamichane making the 11 today? I say unlikely but on the cards as spinners came clutch for RCB in the last game on the same ground. Might mean Stoinis  also has to bowl more than is expected of him, unless Harshal also makes his way in.",6
[MI fans watching today's match](https://i.imgur.com/YDhtErW.jpg),8
Hope Priyam Garg opens with Warner if Saha is unavailable. Goswami is pretty much specialist wicketkeeper.,8
Silly question: but what happens when an IPL Playoff game gets rained out?,7
"questionnn: can we register someone else (say, garg) as wicket keeper and then sub on goswami when its srhs turn to bowl?",4
Two teams I've been rooting for this season.  Whoever wins this should go on and beat MI. SRH probably is that team.,4
"from cricinfo:  I am afraid Nagraj Gollapudi has given me some not-so-great news for SRH fans: ""Saha is understood to have hurt his hamstring in his left leg. With the Australia Test series in December, both Saha and BCCI would want to play safe. It is unlikely he will play any further part in IPL unless Sunrirsers are desperate and push him to.""",6
Couple years soon before everyone mocks us fans if we call ourselves underdogs! Lol stop it guys. It's like trying to push an agenda!,6
Supporting Srh since if Delhi wins then you might as well give the trophy to Mumbai.,4
"I'd send Pant to open and give him a hit or get out license, then Stoinis/Hetmayar",2
Is it gonna be a 10 wicket loss or a 100 run loss?,6
"Half an hour till toss, I don't even know what toss outcome to hope for any more.",2
"Can't see DC not surrendering to Rashid, tbh.  Left-handed Pant should be taking down Rashid, but Pant in current state of mind is no better batsman then a random man on the street.",8
"I am pretty optimistic about our chances today.. I got a hunch we gonna play freely, maybe fail spectacularly or smash it unbelievably.. won't be a middle ground today.. it's literally do or die..",6
Why the fuck is the finals on a Tuesday?,32
Guys? Looks like it's raining in Dubai :(,5
Wont even be slightly surprised if we found out even warner and rashid are injured today and we simply run out of players to play,64
Why do world class professionals who've been playing the sport since before puberty need to still do drills before the game?,1
Seems like it's raining. DLS is certainly going to bite us more than them.,4
Does Delhi even stand a chance against this powerful team?,-11
What rain? Checked weather and it's fine no?,3
Fellow Delhi fans stop reverse jinxing and own it that yes we’re gonna win today,13
Haters (idiots) will say it's raining because of the social reformations in the UAE.,10
Tfw when you realize you're just a fan and none of the analysis and calculations you do in your head and none of the jinxing/reverse jinxing is gonna change the outcome of the game.,56
"Big time for DC to wake up

Tbf delhi has better bowling n better batting on paper",4
If DC batting starts shitting all over itself again I won't  be suprised if Ponting walks out to bat.,77
IIRC Warner has won 7 tosses on trot.. So unlikely we win toss today... Hence highly likely that DC would chase and win the match..,2
I'd find it funny if rain somehow saved us today because Delhi making it into an IPL final is just about as implausible as rain is in the UAE.,2
Funny seeing srh fans reverse jinxing when they clearly they have a momentum.,2
btw guys stop checking accuweather for uae forecast its extremely innacurate lmao,4
"If Saha is still injured, I'd like Rashid Khan to open with warner try to emulate Sunil Narine and take advantage of powerplay. He bats well and can hit few boundaries. Goswami can bat at 6 or 7.",1
"Win or lose, I am gonna miss the IPL so much.",1
"Every team I've been supporting since last few matches have lost. So, I'll be supporting SRH today🤞",2
What does a coach do other than telling players to back themselves?,2
In b4 Goswami's 54(21),5
"Lemme be clear about this, any SRH fan ""reverse jinxing"" gets a down vote from me",-18
"Can't see DC winning the IPL even if they win today.. It is the Koach curse. Koach = Punjabi origin (KXIP), from Delhi (DC) and plays for Bangalore (RCB). Hence all these three teams (RCB, DC and KXIP) will never win a title. Better to lose today as SRH have a better shot at breaking the Mumbai hegemony",34
"Random question: Finals, and if a team needs 2 runs to win, with 1 wicket in hand, and the bowler bowls a wide, but the batsman gets stumped. Does the bowling side win, or is it a super over?",6
"Team for Delhi :

Dhawan  
Shaw  
Hetmyer  
Iyer  
Pant  
Stoinis  
Axar  
Harshal  
Rabada  
Ashwin  
Nortje

What say?",3
"Teams making top 2 and not entering the finals:

1) DD - 2012 (lost against KKR in Q1 and then to CSK in Q2)

2) GL - 2016 (lost against RCB in Q1 and then to SRH in Q2)",6
"IPL 2018 SRH lose to CSK

IPL 2019 CSK lose to MI

IPL 2020 MI ???? to ???


And the circle is complete.",14
"Toss prediction

  


Iyer we are going to bat first because of dew and we have no idea what to do about our batting, bowling and fielding.",7
[deleted],-2
☁️ 🌥 🌥 ☁️ ☁️,3
I don't mind Goswami playing honestly. I like him,3
"Should DC try getting Pant up at 3 and giving him the full license to play like he wants? Like even if he gets out slogging first ball, so be it. Would be better than watching him struggle for a 30 ball 30. Saw some of his best IPL knocks today. Almost all of them have come when he's entered the crease inside 3-4 overs.",2
Inb4 another Mumbai lad bullies Goswami,-4
Inb4 another Mumbai lad bullies Goswami,5
Saha needs to return man. Goswami seems useless with the bat. We will basically be batting with one batsman less. Makes things easier for DC.,3
Roar Macha is our best anthem imo,9
"How we've played so far, we might get Warner for 0 only for Goswami to score a 100",6
Delhi Capitals deserves to win for [this](https://twitter.com/ESPNcricinfo/status/1325420394724077569?s=20) alone,81
Pant 100(52) incoming.,14
"Dhawan has horribly failed in bringing his experience for use into the young Delhi side, especially you shouldn't do puny shit like thigh-slapping and God forbid we shouldn't even talk about the Indian test vice-captain",-8
"Welp. We had a good season, guys. Meet ya next year.",7
"Going to buy Hotstar for cricket, will the upcoming series between Aus and India be telecasted there too?",4
I'd say win toss- bat first put 170 + on the board for both teams.,2
Missing THAT Deccan Chargers anthem.,11
DC won the toss. We got a chance boys!,10
" 

>Delhi Capitals opt to bat",7
Chose to bat? What the actual fuck,4
DC bat first? No dew today?,15
[deleted],2
Our toss winning streak finally comes to an end,55
did the toss happen?,3
Interesting choice to bat first,2
4d by Shreyas,7
Good decision to bat first.,6
Delhi have no problem winning (the toss),3
"Good call, we cant chase for shit",11
"Owwwwwee this is interesting, DC are batting first",3
"Haha Iyer forgot lmao, Dubey in is a good move IMO",3
Captain doesn't know the team he is fielding!,3
"DC have lost both their matches against SRH chasing. Maybe not a bad move to bat. Plus, Ponting is an Aussie. Runs on the board and then pressure.",1
Lmao how do you forget a guy like Hetmyer,7
Lmao.. Shreyas forgetting the team changes..,3
So much for Phoren captains to not remember Indian players,8
"Warner lost the toss after a loooong time, interesting call and DC captain looks confident!",4
Okay. 3 spinners. Yar amit mishra sir ki injury aaj tak khaa rhi he humaari team ko.,2
Ah careful there. You don't want to reveal your strategy Shreyas.,4
That talk from Iyer during toss itself was so negative man. He's saying we lost last two chasing with SRH and lot of similar stuff.,3
Iyer is so honest during interviews.,5
Iyer is a no bullshit guy. Said they chose to bat because they lost their previous games vs SRH when they bowled first,107
Damn so both parties are satisfied,3
Both captains happy with the toss,6
So Saha is being rested as a precaution for the upcoming Australian tour and Rohit who was deemed injured to tour Australia declares fit and plays for MI?  I wouldn't be surprised if BCCI will be reporting to MI in a few years.,23
"I think it's advantage SRH, they've done really well after restricting the opponent and chasing it down",2
"On the one hand I really want DC to win the IPL; on the other hand, I want us to put indisputable difference between ourselves and RCB as the ultimate meme team.",2
SRH is actually vulnerable when chasing,8
Delhi is the best defending side this IPL. Feel for SRH they're on course to be knocked out now,4
No Saha :'(,3
Shreyas looks nervous as fuck. But let’s do this Delhi bros!,7
"Iyer: We want to bat first because SRH won twice against us when they batted first 

Also Iyer: We don't want to think about previous games; it doesn't matter what happened in the past.

Man, how confused is he? XD",21
"I'm not unhappy necessarily with the batting first (idk what's better at this point), it's more that winning the toss hasn't been good for us.",6
"^(Delhi have won the toss)

Oh No!

^(And have elected to bat first)

Anyway..",8
Dang it no Saha,8
Saha :(,6
Go Dc... go to dubai for finals.,6
SRH chasing is just gonna give me anxiety as soon as Warner’s wicket falls,15
So Iyer winning the toss means Delhi lose right?,4
Fuck no Saha fml :(,15
So no WAHA show today:-(,29
"Look in my opinion, SRH are gonna win this time. They've had a very tough road to the playoffs and their arc is very similar that of Pakistan in CT17 and those kinda teams are incredibly hard to beat. 

Do well SRH.",1
"From iyer's speech , delhi looks PREPARED 

without saha , we'll probably lose if they make anything over 100",10
"DC won the toss and are batting first (SRH wanted to bowl anyway)

Same team for SRH

Dubey in for Sams and Hetymer in for Shaw",3
Even when Davey loses the toss he wins it lol,13
Stoinis opens i think.,3
Why do SRH always chase in the knock out games and give us mini heart attacks,24
I think dc have decided to come in and just go for it and aim for 200 plus,3
"So Saha tore his hamstring, so even if we win today, he wouldn't be playing the next match either",7
Hetmeyer's century of rage incoming today,2
I feel like we gonna crumble tonight,5
"Feel srh will lose today. Warner will be the key scalp again. Dc look strong.

But lowkey as a srh fan for this season, hope we can pull thru",10
[deleted],0
From my cellar I have pulled out the finest bottle of whiskey infused with lassi flavours. Will open it after DC win.,2
Lezzz go DC join us,2
I can't believe people are upset about Saha. How the fuck did he turn from that shit knock he played halfway through the tournament to this absolute match winner that everyone is missing rn,11
Should Stoinis open or should Rahane?,2
[deleted],13
Did Warner remind Iyer of Hetmeyer at the toss!?,9
"DC favoured to win - SRH pulling off a chase against Nokia, Rabada, Axar, Ashwin; not really seeing that happening.",15
"* Great call to drop Shaw
* Lots of batting power with heymeyer in, if there is a hige total on baord SRH might find it difficult
* Rabada and Nortje can put pressure
* Expect delhi to start aggressive batting",5
Fully expect stoinis to get maybe even 3 overs today,2
"I am gonna be so happy if Stoin opens, Hetmyer has to come at 3 tho",2
"Nah man, these injuries are actually fucking frustrating. Marsh, Bhuvi, Shankar, Saha, Williamson some games... We’re basically playing with our B team at this point",23
Still no left hander in the middle order and Delhi brings an extra leggie. Looks like they're trying to repeat the middle order choke from spin that RCB tried in the previous game.,5
IPL owners tweeting constantly about the team is cringe.,4
"If we score anything over 160, game on.",5
"It’s a great season no matter what, Shankar/Marsh/Bhuvi/Saha all would be starters and we got this far. Just hope the team plays with freedom and attacks.",7
"Rashid Khan against DC this year

8 overs, 20 runs and 6 wickets.",15
"Good news of batting first is that if our batting lineup collapses in epic fashion, the game will end sooner and it won't prolong our pain.

They're doing it for the fans guys.",7
Slightly unrelated to the match but shouldn't Purple and Orange cap be decided after the end of league phase? It is slightly unfair to Bumrah that Rabada and DC are getting one extra game than MI.,8
Stoinis gonna fuck us up after we beat zampa last game,90
lol it would really funny if after all the talk Hetmyer opens,6
So is DC not expecting any dew?,9
Why do the practice jerseys look better than the original match jerseys? Lol.,24
Poor Lamichane didn't get a look in all season,9
"DC looks so strong, I think we are gonna take the plane home tonight",1
"I have bet on almost all games since this Reddit Prediction thing started and won none so far. I really want a new team to lift the trophy so have bet on SRH today.

Ponting can thank me later.",6
"As a Delhi fan all I am hoping is we play like Delhi Captials and not Delhi Daredevils 

Insert Micheal Scott meme:I'm ready to get hurt again",14
"Right toss by DC, they have a lot less pressure batting first and they have more experience with their bowling attack. Going to be a fun game.",3
"yep ...swanny is definitely either drunk or hungover ...

its going to be a usual swanny torture on dugout but only worse..",3
This is Delhi's game to lose now. Take care of MI in final Capitals,2
Tremendous pressure on Goswami to perform today,9
Worst part about batting first is I have to see Batting choke early in the game,4
"Send garg to open today cowards, he's an opener/3rd anyway",12
"  Lamichane , Stanlake, Lynn, Tye,  Fabian Allen - Trying to think of overseas players who enjoyed a big long vacation in the UAE.",20
Dropping Shaw wasn't necessary. SRH lacks the pace to seriously trouble Shaw. He might have done more damage than Rahane.,6
Ethical Ashwin didn't want the opposition players to struggle with dew and gain an unfair advantage over SRH.,4
SRH are playing in a different IPL- Injury Premier League.,30
"Good decision to bat first. Our strength is bowling, and we should play on that. 

Now all is asked of the batters is a defendable total. Let's find out.",4
Given that goswamy is playing even today looks like we'll be starting from 0/1. And SRH have a very poor record against someone making their debut against them has a history of doing well. So congratulations Delhi hopefully you guys beat Mumbai.,8
Good thing about having a over seas spinner like rashid is that he never gets injured,5
A bit surprised that DC left Shaw out,8
"If even DC win today , I wont be disappointed because of all the injuries and badluck we still pulled through till Q2.",9
They should’ve played lamichane 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️,1
There is a sun setting shot they show in pre match... any symbolic indication by script writers? \^/s,5
I want a Delhi win but I also want Bumrah to retain that fucking cap,5
"Come on Delhi. Let's put these moon sleepers to sleep. 
Chalo Dilli !! Chalo chalo chalo....",1
"If Saha is unavailable, it’s good that SRH is backing Goswami and not making any new changes. Should give him some confidence after last game",9
"SRH's winning secret is that they sacrifice a player to the injury gods to win.

This is a very steep ask today - will need Warner or Rashid injury to get us over the line.",8
"Dhawan has to play ""senior-player knock"" today, otherwise DC is fucked.",3
What is the Reddit prediction thing?,2
Big Hetty gonna do the thing today,3
Every second comment here so far is a SRH fan trying to reverse jix the hell out of it.,4
"Go SRH, go.",4
"Let's go DC, just to see a EZ PZ MI DC fight.",7
"What's DC batsmen plan against Rashid going to be?

- Attacked him and gave 3 wickets in the first game

- Overly cautious in the second game, still lost 3 wickets",2
"I am not a great fan of this eliminator and qualifier format. In 2009, DC and RCB went to play finals who were 8th and 7th in the inaugural. Once you reach playoffs or semifinals, you are expected to perform well and giving top teams another chance will take out the beauty of teams who were in 3 and 4th to cause an upset and go on to win the cup.",3
Newbie Dubey over experienced Harshal! Will either backfire or win us the match.,3
[deleted],5
"Bruh DC twitter page posted the lineup showing Rahane up with Dhawan, would be an anti climax",3
"Imagine working your ass off to reach second qualifier by winning 4 matches on a trot only to face ravaging, hot-blooded, energetic Capitals of Delhi. Feel sad for SRH",6
"Us SRH fans have made peace with the fact that there is a huge chance of us losing today given that Delhi's top order are due for a big one. Given the injuries to key players like bhuvi, Mitch, 5D and a resurgent Saha we will be happy with 3rd place. All the best Delhi have a good night against Mumbai. Make the rest of the country proud",11
"The only DC players I'm worried about is Stoinis, Rabada, and Nokia",3
Mostly worried about Hetmeyer. He's one batsman who can actually play Rashid well. He's long overdue a big innings. Remember the last league game of 2019.,4
I swear if Pant plays that chutya sweep shot again and gets out.,2
Just avoid 0/3 and DC will be cruising.,6
Thank god everyone picked SRH in the commentary team. They are almost never right except for MI's games.,9
"Dc has a real high chance on winning, idk what swaney and Lara are saying",8
"Wtf r SRH fan talking abt??  Always crying abt injury. 

DC dont have Ishant n Mishra. They missed Ashwin initially n Pant in middle. The latter has obviously fucked up their batting lineup. 

Injury is the part n parcel of the game. So just accept n stfu.",-4
[deleted],30
"So it has rained in some part of UAE today, usually this starts by mid October but thankfully it didn't.",4
Can Manish Pandey open and Kane at 3?,1
"I hope Rashid gets BBC'd by Hetmyer today. 

Rashid really gets rattled and quite anxious when someone hits him for 2-3 big sixes.",3
"Do people here really believe in jinx/reverse jinx? Or is the word being misused for ""please don't increase my hopes and cause a heartbreak later"".",8
Rahane opening with Dhawan? Not bad for SRH as both are not explosive early on,1
"I think they should open with Stoinis and Dhawan and have Pant come in at 3. 

If 2 quick wickets fall, then Rahane can come in and stabilize, else, Iyer and Hetmyer can take over and Rahane can be pushed as far down as possible.",1
"My Dear SRH fans,


Please don't comment with the sole purpose of reverse-jinxing. I am tired of people complaining about us.


Have faith our team lads.",13
This is the best scenario for DC. A 160 will win the game.,3
Boost stamina meter is the most pointless sponsor award thing I've ever seen lol,9
Shaw dropped.  I predict in five years he'll be benching for RR with no other real career in cricket to speak of.,5
I know Shaw is pretty much a walking wicket but I don't see any sense in strengthening the bowling more when it's not the issue to start with. Unless they are looking to negate the effect of dew,6
Any predictions for DC innings lads?,2
How many wickets in first over?,3
Saha has hamstrin tear when will he come back what do u guys think?,3
Wish we had Mishraji and Ishant ..,6
Everyone orgasming in that syska ad,4
Wtf why are they batting? SRH are too lucky,4
Have a feeling that Stoinis will play a big innings today to get revenge for Zampa’s team being eliminated despite him bowling well,10
[deleted],5
Can any DC fan tell me why Harshal Patel doesn't get chances anymore? He looked absolutely fine playing and was giving some much needed balance to the side,3
man ...just checked .. the insance ipl marketing put me off but the altroz is just 6.6 lakh ...sounds like a sweet deal,10
"Come on DC fans 

Why r u not crying for not having Ishant n Mishra?  N also Pant being out of form after injury.",8
I love the introduction that IPL gives for every match. Gonna miss this.,3
[removed],9
Who the heck is Praveen Dubey?,4
if DC wins today I will root for them in final as a new franchise going to win a cup...,10
"There was a rain threat earlier, all clear now?",3
"I hope DC wins, it'll be another ez win for MI in finals",-2
I just hope that all the reverse-jinxers words come true. It'd lot more fun that way.,4
IPL is coming to an end and it's suddenly dawning on me on what to do with my life from now on.,13
Ravaging young blood of DC is the last thing SRH would want to face before getting eliminated. They should be legit scared,6
Incoming another 20-2 in 6 over.,-1
In before Stoinis gets revenge for Zampa,9
Warner pulling a koach there at the toss saying we wanted to bowl first anyway XD,25
"Last time Delhi brought in a young spinner in Qualifier 2, Summy Gupta was smashed to pieces in 2012. Gave 3-0-47-0. Was his debut game. Didn't play a game after this. It was Murali Vijay's day. 


Hope Pravin Dubey does better.",5
MI have a DC team they have owned upto this point vs a SRH team without Saha to face in the final.,2
We've been talking about Shaw and Dhawan's form but Iyer too has dropped off horribly as we racked up the losses. He really needs to perform for us to have a chance tonight.,5
LettzgooooOOoo^ooooooo baby!,4
I'm sorry I'm late was too involved in playing Among Us,7
"Everytime a DC batsman gets out: damn, prithvi would have hit that out the park",5
Will Virat play all tests in Australia?,4
[removed],6
Does it start in 5 or 35 minutes?,1
Bringing back the bull,3
SRH boys..... STFU and don't reverse jinx. Enjoy the game.,19
"Even when they lose the loss, they get to do what they wanted. They have been very lucky with tosses lol",3
"DC batting first?


They're winning this.",3
"Kohli in 2008 IPL:  12 innings, 165 runs, 15 average at 105 S/R.

Kohli in 2009 IPL: 13 innings. 246 runs, 22 average at 122 S/R.

Calm the fuck down with the hysteria aimed at young Indian batsmen",3
DC batting fucking strong,10
Stoinis at 4 is bad idea.,3
\_ neither can live while the other survives\_,1
I am not ashamed to admit that I will miss the IPL,2
"Garg is a top order batsman, right. So I would like to see him bat up the order today in the absence of Warner? Do you guys think it might Work",1
"DC gave away Boult to MI in exchange of Mayank Markande, and then traded Markande with Rajasthan to get Rahane. Imagine the MI team without the start, Boult gave them, and Rabada Boult bowling together for DC",6
"Delhi lineup really look a like an explosive one, only if they fire.",5
"4 on the first ball of the innings.

Le SRH fans: gg guys see you next year",6
Did he just say Yorker Natarajan?,6
Mumbai Indians have the best bowlers in the IPL. Will they come to regret resting them against Hyderabad in the last league match ?,2
SRH have been mad consistent throughout the years,2
"What Warner wanted to do if he won the toss? 

Missed the toss",4
Anyone think Dube will ever reach close to fuccboi? He bowls slow but he isn't brain dead like Saini,4
"Genuinely thinking about buying the Altroz.

Confused between the Altroz & the new i20",3
Scotty and bangar are the only smart ones in the dugout,3
Dugout in favor of SRH. They are countering the reverse jinx. RIP us.,6
fuck all that talk about jinx...the dugout majority jinxed srh already ..,5
"Is it just me, or is anyone else fascinated by Warner's jaw line too? Like what exactly is happening there man",2
"Have Pant ever opened for DC? I think, he could do lots of damage in powerplay.",1
"Man, we just need early wickets to expose the SRH middle order..",7
DC elected to bat? Did Warner say they intended bowl or bat?,1
Expecting an entertaining game. Hope Delhi wins.,1
Dhawan's form has nosedived ever since he realised the I in IPL doesn't stand for ICC.,6
I'm very much up for Stoinis opening,3
BIG STOIN OPEN YESSSYEYEYEYEYEYEY,7
Pant 100(52) and Stoinis 72(46) incoming.,2
Benchods vs Bevarsis... let's goooo!,1
"SRH dont usually perform well when they are favourites, DC clearly underdogs today with beter chances!",5
"STOIN OPENING- ALRIGHT IT IS HAPPENING EVERYBODY STAY CALM, STAY FUCKING CALM",4
STOINIS,2
Big stoin opening,3
Big hundred from Stoinis incoming,3
The fireworks seem excessive in an empty stadium lol,3
No Shaw?,2
 What's with garg and camera,4
"STOINIS THE BIG BOYY, LESSGOOOO",5
[deleted],1
"If the score od anywhere near 170..I would advise all the SRH fans to stop watching and save themselves from the pain of losing out to the Young team.

It's probably time to bring down our hopes and face the reality that we aren't that strong to chase 170 against Rabada and Nortje.",3
I hope Shreyas Iyer’s impression of Stoinis gave him some power before the match,3
"If this is the last night for DC, I just hope that we play well and go out fighting.",1
Stoinis is batting at the top. A sensible descision and I am getting worried,1
Starting big with Stoin! Let’s do this.,3
DC already won one half of the match by not playing Shaw,3
Big bash Stoinis mode: Activated,4
i don't have hotstar 🥺,4
Time to send the DC team back to the airport.,4
"Okay so I'm going to sleep now, me sleeping is lucky for SRH.",9
"Stoinis against seaming Sandeep, I am already worried",3
Problems with DC are not with their players. It's their coach. Richard Ponting? Lol who tf even is this dude? I think Ashish Nehra/Ramesh Powar/Akash Chopra should be their coach.,3
inb4 stoinis pull a Daredevil,2
Stoinis opening with Gabbar,8
All my rcb homies support dc,8
"Either DC absolutely murders Srh, or gets murdered by Srh. There's no in between with DC.",8
Stoinis to open? We should get spinners early on,2
Stoinks 📈,5
"FIRST KOHLI , NOW STOINIS WHY DOES EVERYONE TRY TO CORRECT THEIR MISTAKES AGAINST US SMH",21
Ngl Stoinis opening scares me,3
Changing the batting line-up in an important knock-out match? Is this the One True successor to Koach?,5
DC should go all out and have Pant come in at 3 no matter when the first wicket falls. You'll anyway have Rahane and Iyer to stabilize the middle order.,5
Never a good sign when teams make massive changes at the knockout stages.  Stoinis opening.,7
Why is everybody having oragsm bcuz of stoinis.,7
"Dhawan is a great bloke, even better batsmen but why the actual fuck he doesnt want to face the first ball",10
hum haarenge,4
NOO brian’s so confident,3
Can DC outscore RCB today?,4
Dugout is a troll.,5
"I don't like seeing such sudden big brain moves in semifinals/finals. Stoinis has been a good finisher. That is one thing that has consistently worked for DC. Why change that?

But, let's see if the gamble pays off!",6
Lara saying wicket Bois..,5
Lara has this game figured out,3
Every fucking commentator and even dugout is supporting us. It's like everybody is conspiring against us. Big stoin gonna cunt us tonight and we are fucking chasing again. We are dead. Good night guys.,8
Bro he has already tackled swing better than Shaw,6
damn marcus aurelius looks scary,5
Wicket alert first over by Lara lol,7
We are fuvked guys stoinis is opening.,10
"I feel Delhi are missing a certain Jason Roy

Had he not skipped the IPL, his destructive batting at top cud have solved their batting issues. 

Woakes also pulled out. Ishant n Mishra got injured. 

But never hear DC fans complaining.  Good fanbase",8
My grandma has trouble sleeping so I switch on the Select Dugout. What a snooze-fest lol. Get me some Akash Chopra and Ashish Nehra.,5
Ah Stoinis is my Captain in a team. Please pay me good Stoinis.,13
the game hasn’t even begun and Brian Lara has hit wicket alert lmao,30
survive the first over,7
"DC fans shouldn't even try to reverse jinx today, you can't match with SRH reverse jinxing skills.",9
Big ~~brain~~ balls move by DC,7
every DC match gives me unparalleled anxiety,8
Mark Nickolas has the biggest commentators curse,4
Fck yea stoinman is opening,5
stronk defence,4
Short mid-on! Damn haven't seen this in IPL first over ever I think,5
Ricky ponting using his experience and knows its important to bat first in virtual semi final.,11
damn this Sandeep guy gets a shit ton of movement,10
Good swing for Sandeep. Rabada and Nortje should be very happy,9
Chewing gum is the secret of Aussie's energy,12
Stoinis 146 or 14(6) today.,5
Omg the madlads literally opened with Stoinis,10
Why do I get the feeling that DC became DD mid season,6
[deleted],5
Shreyas following vk . New opening batsmen and an extra spinner.,5
outperformed Shaw by this run,7
Matt Stoinis should do well as the opener.,3
Up vote the thread y’all,7
Fingers crossed for Dhawan's non-duck score,6
Will the all star game happen?,4
"Remember when everyone was saying trade Rahane? Good times, now he’s starting basically every game",11
Sun-rye-zars! Sun-rye-zars!,5
Am I the only one left on the planet who does not find Stoinis attractive?,6
"if we survive pp, it be uplifting",4
"While I will miss the carnage, the chaos, and the hilarious fielding mishaps, one thing I really won't miss will be that stadium announcer the IPL has.

The next time any announcer tries to start a crowd chant in an empty stadium, they deserve to have their mic cut off",8
"I love Srh as a team, but please can we have a new winner. Next year it can be Punjab, and then last but not the least Rcb can have the trophy some year with ABD retiring the same year.",4
"Stoinis opening is not an unusual move, he made the highest score in BBL opening 147 from 79",11
Here comes first wicket.,3
Is Sandeep ball tampering? How is he getting so much swing? /s,6
"Lol Sunny G with that ""winning dugout"" comment for Delhi.",4
"1*(2), Dhawan is scoring a century today, bois /s",5
"Both Delhi openers are off the mark

We are in unprecedented times",8
"Some supporting SRH. Some supporting DC. I'm supporting umpire Paul Reiffel. I know you didn't mean to kill that pigeon.

One small thing I dislike about Sreevats is him knocking the bails when it isn’t required.,3
Very aggressive captaincy from Warner,2
Sandeep bowls pace?,3
Dhawan off the mark. 100 confirmed?,7
"Shikhar Dhawan shouldn't slow down this game 
 
DC needs a quick start from him",4
Warner and Saha gonna make 18 in the first over,4
i like tuktuk,6
Srh fans rn: GG bois Delhi have scored their first runs without losing a wicket. All the best for finals.,15
We have lost wicket in the 1st over more times than when we haven't lost a wicket,7
Both openers get off the mark ☑️. Already a moral victory for DC,19
Success! We actually scored a run before losing wickets.,21
Stoinis is already looking so much more reliable than Shaw as an opener,7
No wickets in first over. I like this feeling.,6
Good start from SRH,6
DC playing too cautiously. Ponting must have given them a thorough thrashing after that 0/3 start,8
"Wait a minute, no wicket lost in the first over, what world are we living in right now",6
[deleted],5
"The DC Openers duck jinx has been broken.


Be very afraid SRH.",6
Big stoin opening! Was waiting to see this,3
What kind of EA Sports 07 basic field setting is this?,8
No wicket in 1st over. Punter would be proud.,6
ICC Dhawan and 146 Stoin please,6
Sup boys. Are we on for a cracker or a one sided affair. Place ya bets,2
"Good signs for Delhi, have not lost wicket in first over",6
"Just step out for natarajan, turn yorkers into full tosses",4
No prithvi so no wicket in first over,7
At least Stoinis is able to put his bat in front of the swinging deliveries. Shaw would've already edged an incoming delivery on to the stumps.,3
You are safe dc Dhawan either score 0 or 50+ nothing in between,9
Hopefully Stoin can have a good innings like his beau had last game,3
"No wicket in the first over, you guys are so screwed SRH",4
"Dugout Team - *announces score at the end of the over*

r/Cricket comments - Damn! Dugout is on a different fucking level! Never switching to old commentary again!",8
Another slow surface like Friday's game?,4
Great progress for DC: From 0-3 to 3-0 :D,8
Where's the collapse I came for.,5
inb4 2nd over wicket,2
3/0 is much better than 0/3,6
Holder is the match winner,4
"Take that haters!

From **0/3** to **3/0** in one match, and they said it couldn't be done",31
Folks 3/0 is better than 0/3,1
First time in 4-5 matches when we havent lost a wicket in the first over right? Wow what a feeling,6
i like this stronk looking opening,2
Holder should really be able to bowl about 20 km/h quicker than he is,3
RABADA STOP LMFAO,7
Did y'all see rabada? Lmaoooo,4
"I'm scared to even look at the screen right now

Please just go wicketless for the first few overs",3
Here for Warner's 100,1
Rabada feeling like Belle Delphine,5
Rabada 🤣,7
At least Iyer is relaxed and not looking like a kid after getting a heavy scolding from their mother.,2
Stoinis being cautious at start. A positive.,2
HAHAHA RABADA,3
"Win or loose, i love this srh team, they work together really well. If only we could retain the whole team",4
Not sure how I feel about Rahane at 3,2
Dhawan bout to score either 50+ or less than 10,2
Rabada clowninn hahaha,3
Wtf Rabada😂😂😂😂,2
Rabada LAMO,3
"> Wriddhiman Saha has a hamstring tear, 

This hurt me for real. No offence to Pant, Saha is my preferred 'keeper for Tests in Australia.",5
Rabada is adorable,2
jason hold my beer is here,5
Is Rashid hurt?,2
Lmaoo rabada you're a treasure man,2
Iyer and Rabada are having fun. Clearly the script writers have spoiled the ending.,3
Oh no not rashid,4
Stoinis is a T20 opener. It took 16 matches for them to realize this,2
Do you think Koach is watching the match?,4
"""karamati khan""",3
Rash you okay!?,7
Not another srh bowler getting injured smh,10
"fuck, pulled hamstring?",3
[deleted],0
Is Rashid Khan ok?🙄😳,5
Uh oh,4
Dhawan looks to be in good flow.,8
no no no no,5
[deleted],-13
You need to sacrifice your hamstring to play for SRH,42
U ok there Rashid bro?,7
I think warner is the most consistent player since last 6 ipl,6
"No, not Rashid ffs.",5
Am I evil for getting excited?,8
Bruh this is our most positive start since almost forever.,8
Nooo. Rashid please don’t get injured,8
ICC dhawan in store today?,3

Oh no Rashid,5
Srh fans please stop. Dont panic atleast wait for pp.,2
Get 150+ and see SRH fall like 9 pins.,5
Oh fuck Rashid better not have injured himself,6
"Cmon Sikhar get out

I wanna see Stoinis n Iyer batting both tryna imitate each other",8
"ICC tournament Dhawan loading, successfully loaded 68%",5
Dhawan looking in ICC form.,3
this is not the dc opening we signed up for ...,3
My dad just now: “this idiot couldn’t bat like this in the last match?” I’m dead,8
"Well bois Dhawan didn’t get out for duck today, meaning he’s obviously gonna score a 100",9
"Of Dhawan gets set

Game over boys",6
Does Dhawan live in Australia?,4
Dhawan gets 50/100 or 0.. no in between,5
What team is this? 10 runs without no loss of wickets?,4
Where’s that jinxer who said Rashid will get injured this game,4
"As much as I like RCB and DC, the only team who can beat MI rn is SRH",2
I.... I..... ICC Dhawan?,6
oh fucc Dhawan looking good,5
"CSK might be a retirement home, but even they don't get injured like Sunrisers Hamstrings",9
"Delhi fans: Is this real life, is this just fantasy?",5
"Sikhar's batting form is 0 or 50+

U know what is coming today",5
Suninjuries hyderabad!,5
In which stadium is the match ?,3
Didn't think this would happen but Warner's stash has grown on me.,3
"Bruh these artificial crowds noises don't even make sense. I've never heard fans chant "" Shikar shikar shikar "" probably heard Dhawan.",7
"Just hope Rishabh ""fuck it's the end of the series, better make some runs"" Pant shows up today ffs",34
TALL,4
Dhawan 100 incoming,2
F someone said SRH sacrifices a player to injury and win the game,6
And it's hetmeyer now lmaooo DC dugout is a comedy show,7
Dhawan is truly a big match player,7
"No early wickets guys, time to panic.",8
Let's hope these two bat for all 20 overs.,7
SRH bowling even without Bhuvi is great.,5
Haha Binga is wholesome,2
"Didnt know it until now , so felt like saying 

You can collect a free award by clicking on the coins button on home page",2
Happy birthday BINGAAAA! ❤️,4
Dhawan tends to perform in the knockouts.,2
Peak Delhi thing to do would be to run stoinis out here,3
Qualifying for the IPL finals is a lot like the eating of an orange,5
lmao they brought a cake for brett lee,9
Birthday celebrations hahaha,6
"Happy birthday bingaa!

  


You are cute",3
Ponting giving points,2
Join the birthday celebrations at the Dugout!,7
Happy Birthday Binga....,6
Wholesome and awkward in dugout,5
Ponting telling Rahane to not make bahane,3
Where is Rashid ?,1
Is this how stoinis opens in Australia?,3
"Before the season started, I remember how people were shitting on Stoinis Left Right and Center. But he has done so bloody well. Dare I say if he continues this we might actually RTM further down the road",6
F for Brett lee.,7
Dugout is really awesome man. Its just entertaining in its own.,11
"Brett Lee's birthday on the dugout.    
Its so cute. Bangar also seems more at ease with these lads than he was earlier",12
Cake smash for Binga,5
Just got caked,5
On-screen graphics these days will tell you what kind of underwear the player is wearing but still these MFers still won't add a small square showing the batsmen running singles (like the used to in the 90s),7
"behenchod sandeep ""spinner that swings"" sharma",3
not to be a party pooper but I highkey hate the cake in face tradition,15
Yes Binga shove the cake into the mic,12
"Josh ad, Jacqueline Fernandes cringe dancing in red dress😐",4
"If Dhawan (533) / Warner (546) score a good 60-80 today and they win the match, they have a realistic shot at displacing KL Rahul (670) and winning the orange cap!",7
"SRH injuries/ Banned team

Shakib, 3D, Saha, Marsh, Bhuvi.

5/11..",7
Woohoo Stoinis is opening!!,3
We're in trouble if we don't get a wicket this over,5
They CAKED Lee,25
never disappoint swanny,13
Is Rashid injured ?,3
Just tuned in and the madman punter actually opened with stoinis!!!!!!!! What an absolute mad lad.,5
Sunrises without bhuvi is performing way above my expectations,6
Come on stoned-nis. Unleash that Ganja energy onto yessarech.,3
Keep batting like this stoinis. Take your time and then get out without scoring pls.,1
"Now that we have seen ICC Dhawan, let's hope for ""Carefree"" Pant.",3
"Lol, looked like Sandeep Sharna waited for them to cut the cake. Imagine trying to do this in a Jadeja over",3
Pant from behind the stumps to Pollard if they qualify: Have you heard of a temporary captain?,6
Fuck this tradition of smashing cake on the face on b'day. Why waste such a tasty dessert.,12
Swanny should get the best entertainer award.,3
Axar patel is padded up this could be funky.,4
Damn he’s just gonna sit there with cake on his face lmao,9
sanjay bangar standing like a kilometer away lol,9
Once again proving why dugout is the superior stream,12
Goddamn the ball that pitched 4-5 feet away from the off stump is reaching almost the off stump. Sandeep you ball tamperer.,8
Dugout: match can wait ..leme picture,8
Murali Kartik just compared bhuvi's pace to praveen kumar lmao,3
"What the fuck is the fake crowd chanting?

Halla bol?",4
Nice drop. Go dc.,3
Holder couldn't hold on,5
Ohhh... What a field placement,7
Aww shit,4
Stoin pls don't turn into Australia Stoin,3
Almost,3
Ponting using an IPL playoff to test his options for Australia's T20Is...lol,3
What a field setting !!👌👌,8
If big daddy holder couldn't catch that nobody can,7
Fucking brilliant from Warner,4
Ooooooh,2
Holder had one job,2
Dave: “YEAAAAAOOOHHH”,2
"That's a big drop

Stoinis is not looking very good",3
That field placement damnnn,7
"Dugout 

Expectation : in depth analysis from the greats of the game 

Reality : fuck cricket, Birthday celebrations and cake it is.",6
Luck going our way *Confused Panic*,3
If DC are going out they better go out swinging. Just like how Trump yesterday went down swinging......in the golf course. Literally.,3
"step out, fuck sandy",6
Dugout is 😍,2
"Axar padded up, Ponting speaking to Rahane, probably about intent™. Hyped",3
That should've been caught,2
Couldn't they do this during one of the timeouts? Seems a bit demeaning to importance of the game when comms would rather spend time smearing cake than commentating on live game.,0
holder couldn't hold it lol,3
Insult to injury now,2
That should’ve been caught,2
Holder didn't justify his name.,5
"Jason Holder? More like Jason Dropper, Am I right?",1
gg guys see you next year,5
"Off topic, who all going to watch Mukuthi amman just for RJ Balaji??",4
Unholder,4
Why is Axar padded up? Are Delhi already preparing to collapse?,3
Holder couldn't hold the ball,5
How did that miss from those gigantic hands.,2
"Holder couldn't hold onto it, badum-tsss.",4
Oh ffs. Great field placement by Warner though,6
Those forearms are thicker than my thighs,4
[removed],10
"Jason, Hold it yaar",7
Dropped catch but shows how good Warner’s field setting is,6
I'm sry but SRH's jersey is the ugliest,1
"I call it, that drop won't be costly..",-7
Field placement is 4D chess not even in a sarcasting way warner boi,1
It's already looking bad for SRH,2
survive pp,1
Guess he dropped the match.,4
"*spoken out the side of the mouth*

You've just dropped the IPL",5
"Regardless of what we might think of his commentary otherwise (not much), Gavaskar had a point. Shame he didn’t mention the country and spoke about it obliquely. And quite telling that he wouldn’t mention it on the global feed.",1
Holder's drop has already cost 8 runs,3
Stoin gets going good to watch,1
"the DC anthem just sounds like dilli reeeeee 

tu lodu macha",3
Big dick energies of Stoinis and Holder clashing,3
Axar is probably the plan to kamikaze attack Rashid.,2
Though a missed chance but what a field placement !!,4
"Mark Nicholas on the normal commentary now but dugout is still on.

Whom does r/Cricket circlejerk now?",1
"I'm scared of opener stoinis 

Go srh!!",5
"Costly drop from Holder. 

Cricket oxymoron ftw",11
Looking ominous... Need a wicket ASAP,6
"Is it Ian Bishop in the commentary? He seems to be a proper SRH wanker. He just can't stop going on about SRH. 

Hello, there is also another team playing today.",-3
Guys we can’t score anything above 150 😂,5
They getting 170 minimum,7
20-0. Is this real?,9
Em Chestunav ra Holder,7
He's not a good Holder,6
"Stoinis is now gonna go big, thanx Holder",6
"Started from DC, went back to DD. Now back to DC. What a journey in Single IPL :/",9
Yeah we are totally fucked.,11
sandy avoid pads please,2
Flex the guns Marcus,6
What is this munni re song?,1
Stoin already better than Shaw/Rahane starts. I cant even,7
"No need to change your plans or field SRH, sure you got hit for 2 boundaries but Stoinis is far from being comfortable.",5
"Now that srh is getting hyped up, we gonna crumble.

I love when srh is the dark horse",11
GG. Hope we have a injury less year next ipl.,4
Did Holder dropped the game..  I hope so!,7
[removed],5
They should give Sandeep another here tbh,0
Next 3 overs might be carnage after this start.,2
Throw Shahbaz an over in the powerplay? He got Stonis out last time IIRC.,2
Did Iyer make his toss decision by actually assessing the conditions or just cause? Chasing team has won last 6 matches here rofl,-1
"Sandeep Sharma is an excellent operator of a cricket ball, probably the only thing that goes against him is that he lacks that aura around him.",3
"Holder : I am the most effective allrounder of this ipl

Stoinis : Ye me kar leta hoon,  aap dream 11 pe team banao",4
"Kohli, better actor than a captain.",4
For some reason I have a gut feeling that SRH gonna lose today,1
Hashish Nehra,4
Stadium DJ playing Coldplay woohoo,2
Fuck me we are dead,8
Good start so far by DC unlike RCB .,7
Costly drop,3
"Those kind of catches have to stick luckily when you pull it out one handed or else they are tough to hold on given the speed at which it comes and the very short reaction time.

Holder is a damn good slip fielder for his size.",1
They sent their only inform batsman to open hmmm. This’ll be very interesting!!,5
Oh they smashing,3
Costly dropped,3
Big dick stoin 💦💦,5
"The boost kid is so dumb.    
    
You have little or no pace, why are you trying to bounce Virat. Just keep the ball outside off, on a 4th stump line and get him.    
    
Also, making a 3x size portrait of his face isnt gonna help your accuracy",3
Big Stoin 100 coming today,2
Mate this is not my Delhi. I am always half deep in misery in first two three overs. Is this some parallel world?,3
Damn stoin is hitting them balls hard,2
Come on stoinis gtfo,3
Jason Holder more like Jason Dropper lmfaoooo,2
Already the best start in last 10 matches..,2
BC he is not stopping at all. We r fucked,0
Damm stoinis is on fire,1
"shaw wouldnt have survived this long

best partership for dc in last 9 games",2
Drop cost: 13(4)*,7
The stoin 🥵,1
"This DJ has such a variety taste, I dig it",1
"Honestly big brained, put all the explosive batsmen up the lineup. They already act as openers due to Shaw/Rahane and it takes pressure off iyyer/pant who had to act as anchors and got out trying to accelerate",1
"Holder can't complain, could've avoided this had that ball been stuck in his paw",3
It feels like we are watching Stoinis vs SRH instead of DC vs SRH.,4
Opening the batting with the actual Hercules is a cheat code,2
Stoin Show!,2
Stoinis had to have hit that hardddd,5
What a ball that was,4
Ominous batting here from stoinis,8
"Yeah, we're not chasing anything above 130",10
Great comeback Jas,2
Stoinis stonks. That is some bludgeoning.,3
"Delhi should keep it in mind that this is a knockout match and the pressure will be on Srh while chasing, so instead of aiming for a 200 and getting short of 20 runs because of loss of wickets, they should just aim for decent runs and then free up during the last five overs or so. They have the bowlers to win this and Saha isn't there. Williamson can't do it alone for them.",3
"Stoinis is the Australian Pant, all power no finesse lol",1
so whats the pitch report here? Is it goinna get easy to bat on or what,2
im 10 second behind on a third party app streaming 🥺,2
I think Pant should only bat at 5 or 6. Seemed like he was curbing his natural game and trying to build an innings while batting at 4.,5
Why is the final scheduled on a Tuesday instead of Sunday,4
Stoinis going the Stokes route.,5
Punter to stoinis before the match the match :- #SMASH,3
Relax guys. That was a tough catch. Holder was too close to the batsman and the ball was coming too quick.,15
Stoinis taking the revenge of Zampa,20
It almost feels like DC are channelling their inner Ponting who fucks teams over in semi finals,6
"Going to GYM is finally being helpful to Stoinis. Just clear the infield, it will race away. No timing needed.",3
Good cricket from both sides but luck favouring DC,1
I'm only supporting DC because they owe me 10 coins,3
😭😭GG bois win the ipl for us,4
Stoinis opening is basically admission that Shaw and Rahane are not good enough,5
SRH: *Chuckles I’m in danger*,7
Stoin out to kill everyone there,3
Marcus *I live on the edge* Stoinis !,4
"SRH came ready for DD, DC came out of syllabus",2
"Good season boys, will get it next time 👌",1
Stoinis after being dropped is on like 17(6),4
17(6)*,3
Stoinis just throwing the kitchen sink at everything now,6
ro SRH ro,2
Absolute beauty from Holder,1
Some proper fuck off batting from Stoinis here,8

Look at the DOUBLE DEEEEZ LETZOOOO,2
Dont want DC to win just to get thrashed by MI in the final. Feel SRH has a better chance against MI,5

Cracking shot that,3
Finch looks like an absolute muppet compared to stoinis.,3
"18 off the over, the dude is shagging us raw",6
Everything Stoinis touches going to the boundary..,2

Being hit for 18 by the guy you dropped must sting,3

Davey has to get Stoinis quickly else get ready to score a 85(45) today.,4
"He couldn't lift a tt racquet with one hand

Stoinis = God,2
"Holder reaping what he sowed, F",5
Holder better make all these runs by himself when he bats,3
Stoinis going full ab devilliers on holder.,3

Stoin’s six almost fucked the Altroz,1
It’s was inevitable. Even KXIP in the form they were in only had a 5 win streak,2
Anyone else wishing Bairstow was back in the team,1
Bring the spinners on ffs,2
Maka stoinis is a beast opener!,5
"Ponting just toying with us, unleashing Stoinis opening right at the end to take it all.",4
RIP,1
Rashid incoming.. has 6 wickets against DC this year. 3/7 and 3/14,2
Won't there be due in the second innings? Why did Delhi choose to bat,1
Brace yourselves for a gangbang,2
Stoinis hates holder,2

and again finding themselves for 0-3 vs mumbai will be classic",5
"Pretty clear they have made matchups in the dc dressing room 
Stoinis- go after holder
Axar Patel to go after rashid khan",2
Whats up with stoinis and zampa? Anyone can tell me the back story?,2
Stoinis is playing Cricket '07!,1
Good win Delhi. Hope you win against MI and win your first cup.,4
I know hindsight and all but this is making DC’s decision to persist with Rahane and Shaw in the opening spot look like a joke.,3
Feels like it's been years since our bowling was smashed in the Powerplay.,6
Khud bhi jeetunga kisi aur ko bhi nhi jeetne dunga - Delhi Capitals,2
It's confirmed. Delhi is the new Chennai.,2
Now just tonk Rashid,1
Dhawan can easily get tuk tuk now.,2
Let this be a wake up call for Shaw,2
Why is r/cricket filled with whiny fuckers,7
Lovely seeing Holder get exposed. He got a lot of wickets on shit deliveries,2
📈 stonks,4
Man it must hurt Holder for dropping the catch and getting smashed by the same guy in the next over,7
52 average as opener for our boi Stoinis and we kept him playing at the end.,1
[removed],1
Anyone missing Shaw??,5
I want Rashid to open along with Warner,8
"3rd over for sandeep sharma already in powerplay

they are really desperate for wicket now",1
STOKEiniS,2
"Zamps gave his charm to Stoinis ,now he's unstoppable",0
Imagine having the player who scored tons of runs as opener in BBL and not opening with him even though your top order is struggling,2
I like how the RTM and Retaining options keep changing for each team within a game,4
Could be one of the most expensive catch drop of this season.,2
[removed],2
"Stoin has always been an opener, it's just a weird Australian thing that we always just stick our all rounders in the middle order for some reason",7
Stoinis is easing pressure from Dhawan. It can be a great partnership.,4
Hard hands,1
"Stoinis should remain until the end to play both as a opener and as a finisher 

Logistics 101",8
"Stoinis is a smart move. The lack of pace in the SRH lineup plays into his strengths.    
Big upgrade over 1 penny version of Tendulkar",12
watch dhawan try for a sweep,2
Stoinis to do a Watson today by muscling Rashid all over??? Someone hold me LETS GOOOO DC,1
"They're seeing off Sandeep.

Stoinis to attack Holder.

Axar, Dhawan to attack Rashid.

These are the plans methinks.",2
That wasn't an easy catch. Perhaps 2/10 times probability.,7
DC could you play like this against MI please,7
Masterstroke from ponting.,1
"""It's a Jaffa"".

Lol, why is Brett Lee talking about Wasim Jaffer in an IPL match? Idiots.",-2
It wasn't that far away tbh. Anyone would've reached that,1
Sunny just jinxed Stoin,0
 F for everybody who picked Holder over Stoinis like me.,2
All hope on Genghis Khan now.,4
"Things even the bravest men live in fear of:

CSK Jersey Suresh Raina

DC Jersey STOINIS

Anyone from SA wearing pink",1
"How did Stoinis open today, is DC management lurking in match threads here or what",2

Delhi Re..Tu Roar Macha,6
Stonkis,5
Never underestimate the big brain of Punter ever again,12
"Stoinis is a genuinely good opener in the BBL, last season he broke the record for the highest score. He can finish an innings but his best few innings have come when he has time",10
Two Australians taking it away!,15
200 incoming. We're fucked bois,10
RIP Shaw.,9
That's an unique field set- up. Now Kanos is making his moves.,3
"Are the boundaries shorter today ? 

Looks shorter than usual for this ground.",5
This is revenge for the 216,6
DC has sent 2 Australian residents as openers to break their playoffs curse.,14
From 0 to 4,3
Delhi could be 140-1 at 15. And still finish with 170,7
Fun to see Delhi play like this. Can't wait for another 30-5 against Mumbai,2
Does the coach/support staff gets changed too after Mega auction?,1
Nattu ga,5
Every fucking shot is going just enough wide away from the fielder. We don’t even have luck today.,9
"Awful misfield

SRH are disintegrating",6
Zampa's charms working like a charm for DC,5
"We’ll take that one, thanks Nattu!!",2
Get fucked,2
nooo nattu,3
F for everyone who put 10 coins on Srh.. I'm getting so many coins today babyyyy,8
This is just good batting,4
Ponting's expressions when they cut to the dugout after the Dhawan 4 lmao,5
Munni reee... Munni ree...,1
Come on NAT,3
Madarchod DC band kar bhai,0
Thank God for DC they benched that Ajit Agarkar knockoff masquerading as Tendulkar v2.0,7
We love to see this!!,2
Yes give us more miss fields. We need runs!,5
Why the fuck he was so relaxed while stopping that ball.,6
Everything is going wrong this game I guess.,7
oof the midfield,3
She-khar! She-khar! She-khar!,5
"See how Srh look mediocre suddenly? 
Any team under pressure looks like that.",7
ok by,5
[deleted],8
"We remember what you did to us the powerplay last game, SRH. It's our turn now.",3
"If SRH had Bhuvi, what do you reckon will be left out?",1
Someone get a plate full of biriyani ready for our Bois coming back tomorrow,9
Everything is going wrong for us today. Looks like this is the end.,3
"Bro its not an experiment, who is gonna tell Mark that he opens",2
The DC resurgent,3
Lmao fuck SRH (love you guys but still fuck you),5
50 runs within 5 overs. Massacre,4
"Did the keeper just say, no run there?",5
"Wtf dude.. are they planning to hit a 300 or what

Stop it , we are already dead",6
DC bout to smash SRH just to get bowled out by MI for 100 again in the final,5
"SRH has 4 international captain, DC has none",8
MI for 5th ipl. GG,3
Where are the Reverse Jinxing Army?,2
Warner be like ill have time-out now thx,1
Just survive one more ball STOIN.,4
I guess Marcus Stoinis came out of the rough.,5
DC BC tumko isi match main back to form aana tha.,5
Reminds of Shaw giving such starts to DC  in the early few matches. That feels like months ago!,9
DC be pulling off a reverse DD,9
'Stoinis experiment'? He is a fucking opener ffs,76
Don't think Sunrisers can chase anything over 160 tbh. Their batting lineup is weak af. It's their bowling that's been carrying them,7
"I will be honest, I am enjoying this.",5
Warner's been smiling a lot today.,6
You think Delhi losing consistently to SRH/MI is their weakness? Bro we're just trying all the ways we can lose so that the only thing we can do is win :p,5
DC when playing against MI: I sleep.   DC when playing against any other team: Real shit,7
"50 partnership!!!

Bless you Stoin",6
Fuck everyone who jinxed us out of the game with all SRH winning this IPL posts...,10
SRH have taken some RCB energy into this game.,8
There go my 100 coins,4
Holder making Pandey look like less of an money stealing cunt here,1
SRH needs a strategic break ASAP,5
"Stoinis has already done his job, anything from here on is BONUS

so this is what it feels like to have a solid opening partnership",9
Ricky Ponting always looks pissed.,2
Stoinis is certainly proving to be RTM worthy. It's hard to see him making it above Rabada as an outright retention.,3
SRH could chase around 180 w/o losing a wicket in PP.,3
Only chance is a Warner masterclass,7
"I'm glad we made it this far boys, atleast we're getting knocked out by one of the fairer teams. Cheers 🥂",10
im happy w this opening,2
Sandeep is notttt here for it,1
Can Stoinis do to Rashid half of what he did to Chahar?,4
"Punter has played a Harshad Mehta in Scam 1992 level move here with this new opening combo.  
  
How Delhi counters Rashid is the big question here",1
In b4 Rashid next over takes a hattrick and we are back to 50-3,7
"Don't worry guys, DC has one of the best test players. They will make sure they don't cross 170 :)",0
Bring on Rashid already,4
Biryani Shaw must be shitting his pants already,5
Dhawan to fall trying to reverse paddle scoop Rashid Khan?,4
Oh mah gawd. Yeh toh delhi ha 10 overs ka score hota hai,9
I stop watching this :(,2
Jeez,4
RCB died for this SRH? Show some good bowling.,16
Rishabh Trousers,2
"People who bet coins on SRH : Crying

People who bet coins on DC : Laughing like madmen",7
"Fuck 'em up DC, letzooooooo",5
Welcome,3
DC scoring 50 runs without losing a wicket? Is this an alternate universe?,4
I just want to see Warner's face when SRH get outplayed in all departments 😍,3
F,1
SHABAASH GABBAR,2
Oh no no no,2
SRH: Fucc,6
It’s not going well is it,3
"Ricky ponting smiling, I've seen it all now.",4
Rashid Khan^LITE coming in to bowl now.,5
This is DC’s revenge for 2009 SF,6
"Gabbar joined the party. We were brother's once, pls spare us",6
These guys are in some mood. LETS FUCKING GOOO DCCCC,1
"me seeing pontings expression when delhi is not one wicket down for zero:

""He is beginning to believe.""",2
"Supporting DC today !! Want a MI vs DC !! 
Go DC",2
Warner can't do nothin but smile sheepishly,3
Ah yes nice to see Mumbai indies being so dominant. I always like this blue jersey team,5
Warner just asking the ump if they can stop the count cause any more runs scored this innings are fraudulent,3
"Who to support?

Sees Williamson on screen.

Say no more!",6
Excellent DC score well.,3
Wow,3
Loool get rekt Rashid fuck off,3
Goodbye prithvi shaw,6
Wow 5 overs and no wickets? Good going dc,3
Run a ball from here and SRH will be out of the game,3
Shiki Bhai! Beautiful.,2
********S M O K E D********,3
"I saw a srh fan bet coins on dc in the predictions

So u happy or sad?",2
"Why wont you bowl Rashid to break this? Not that I have any problem with this will gladly take it, but bit strange",5
Ponting smiling after ages now,3
Not sure why SRH batting is rated lower. They have two one of the best international players and one Indian regular.,1
Warner got that dead inside smile,3
"It needs bravery to rattle and unsettle these otherwise non special bowlers like Sharma and Holder. 

Right attitude and approach by DC batsmen. That's where RCB failed and succumbed into their own shell. Such a promising batting lineup failing due to mental blocks. 

Good that DC are showing how its done.",5
SRH fans don't get disappointed Ajinkya tuk tuk Rahane and Rishab thala pant are yet to come.,5
Oh boy. Looks like r/cricket's favorite team is getting knocked out today.,6
This is 2003 WC final flashbacks,5
Warner letting all the smile when he could,6
Not sure if Dhawan is SRH agent or Nadeem is Delhi agent,4
Warner confused Nadeem with Rashid,3
"Man I wanted SRH to win, seems tough now :-/",3
Ponting is not chewing his nails off for a change,4
Wtf is this,3
Axar patel comes in next if Dhawan gets out?,3
Shiggy D with the big dick batting,1
"Did ponting gave his spring bat to the openers??
Edit - typo",5
Aaaa let's fucking goooo,1
"It's a no ball, give it.",2
"Stop it , im already crying",4
They literally had no plan for Stoinis. They just stuck to what they have been doing last five matches and teh opposition was ready for it this time,3
Warner in the mud,2
win for ponting,0
The fuck was that ball,2
This is a carnage holy shit. No ball as well.,2
To my fellow SRH fans...what do we do,2
Fuck sake,2
Today is not our day.,2
"no ball?

Edit : fuck yes",1
Fucking stupid bowling from nadeem. No ball? Fucking idiot,3
Srh 😂😂,2
"Another run out, let’s go",2
Lol. No ball by a spinner 😂,3
"Fuck yess, we are back babbbbbby!!!!",3
"Bad call to give Nadeem the over in the last over of the powerplay and after they gained a ton of confidence. 

Should have used him before.",1
Goodbye guys! It was good while it lasted. This is going to be an embarassing loss,2
STOP THE COUNT! THESE ARE ILLEGAL RUNS,61
"Well, it's been a good season considering the ridiculous amount of injuries we suffered. See ya next year!",5
Inb4 Dhawan 100,1
Is there dew already?,1
Hahaha srh ICC dhawan was the last thing y'all wanted,5
Cricket 07 mode: ✅,3
Finally DC playing like I wanted them,1
Thannk you.. Shabas..,1
From bollywood dance songs to bella ciao wtf,2
What happens to a team when you remember shaw,2
"Perfect, absolutely perfect.",5
What are they doing,5
dhawan-stoinis op,1
already made 1/3rd of the expected total. huff,6
Stoinis stepping up after being gon for the middle part of the tournament is a huge plus for DC.,5
Clearly opening with two Aussies is the way to go. Big brain Aussie coach Ponting at work,25
"Solid start from DC, either its going to be a cracker of a match or one sided affair.",7
Gooooo DC! 🚀🚀🚀,7
DC getting all the frustration out from the MI matches,10
It’s like we already gave up.,8
How are we going to chase this?,5
Press F for SRH,7
Kohli ka Ab ka sabka badla lega DC,8
OMG... they are rolling us,8
Some serious cunting by DC,6
Google now giving 70+% win probability to DC.,5
Is it too much to ask for two no ball run outs in one season,3
"Haha Warner just had that expression of 'crap, it's his century day'",5
Nadeem feeding Gulab Jamun  to Dhawan,6
"Orange man: stop the count!

Orange men: stop the count!",25
Rattled your ass sunny,4
Dhawan and Stoinis competing for who'll reach 50 faster,1
Why can't anyone hit on free hit these days? Fixing?,-1
DC are gonna do to SRH what MI did to them,2
Wasted free hit.,0
Left arm spinner to Left hander in powerplay with already 50 on the board Lmao,1
Risky bringing left arm bowler !! seems like warner took lessons from Koach !!,1
Warner looks like he's just glad they've even made it this far..,2
"DC fans to Dhawan for the Nth time: don't try a reverse sweep, never try a reverse sweep",2
"DC 221/2

SRH 132/10

Loading",7
"Sandeep Sharma is one underrated pacer in ipl..it's a tough league for bowlers ask umesh , dinda , awana , vinay kumar etc..
With the kind of pace he bowls at , there is an interesting mixture of swing , knuckle balls , slower ones etc which help him get away with the tonking.
He also has few established batsman like kohli as his bunny.",7
MI humiliated DC and they're taking out on us today. *Ye bhi theek hai.*,13
"Rashid- I gave 7 runs in 4 overs last time against DC

DC- And I took that personally.",3
Rashid 4 overs imp. Get 4-0-30-1 and it's a win,3
Finally they make Stoinis open...I hope DC wins,3
Don’t use Rashid in desperation.,1
"More drops , more miss fields and more free hits.
They I can feel safe.",7
"Ponting - *moves a T20 opener up the order and makes him open*

Everybody - Bravo! What a fucking relevation. Punter you genius.",26
That's equivalent to a six,1
"So, after alllllll the permutations and combinations, it's MI Vs DC as we expected at the start of the tournament?",7
"Kohli probably throwing a fit saying ""Why didn't you get rattled against US""",6
The pitch is going to get slower. SRH ARE SOLEMNLY FUCKED,6
"If DC wins today then MI will win the cup. However, if SRH wins today then there's a slight chance that MI does not hold the cup.",-1
SRH crumbling like the two-bit team it is. No consistency at all lmao,3
Khaleel looking at Warner- yaad aa rahi hai meri?,3
Stoinis is just vibing,2
Pls don’t use Rashid as an act of desperation. Give Nattu an over next.,5
No run there 🤣,2
Delhi ~~Daredevils~~ Capitals,12
[deleted],-4
If DC win tonight Mumbai's gonna run away with the trophy,7
DC desperate to give trophy to MI 😬,6
"Did anyone else notice Harsha using "" not happening for xyz"" too many times in recent games ??",1
Actually feel bad for SRH rn lol,2
SRH Being cunted. It sucks,7
Why is the keeper calling how many runs are there? So annoying.,2
Wow Nadeem has already played 71 IPL matches,1
"Seeing how this is going , they'll probably be at 120 around 10 overs even rahane would start hitting every ball for 4 and pant will return to form and start cunting rashid to reach 260",8
RCB died for this.,37
Delhi's best pp this season?,6
Rahane gonna fuck this RR up.,3
Shaw gonna drown himself with syrup after this,6
"As an SRH fan, not the start I was hoping for",7
SRH : Hello Ben cutting from 2016 final. Please come. We need you.,6
"Bowling too short to Stoinis and too full to Dhawan.

  


Reverse stonks",3
Warner is just grateful they didn't play Khaleel Ahmed lol. DC would have crossed 100 by now.,6
Take the break now and slow the innings.,10
Been a great season either way. Never expected to be here so I'm proud of this team no matter what happens today.,9
"Hope Rashid steps up tonight, and tilts the momentum towards us. 
I don't think they can go on like this after powerplay.",5
I hope Delhi bank on the start they have and nudge Rashid for 5 an over. Please,9
[removed],7
"Lol people were already jumping to conclusion that SRH will stomp DC. But honestly never underestimate a team which has Ponting in it, he knows how to win Knockout matches more than anyone else.",12
"Neither of the two teams look at Mumbai's level.  
  
Way worse. The Cup is Bombay's to lose",15
Inb4 Samad hat-trick,3
Hopefully dc bat first against mi and there a lot of dew,3
Nadeem should be checked for spot fixing. Either he's a cheat or he's fucking incompetent. Either way he shouldn't be playing. Overstepping as a spinner? Fuck right off,-12
"Dhawan scores , DC wins ...as simple as that",18
"Nadeem has issue with overstepping, atleast one every match
Last match got Moeen run out on free hit.",18
SRH fans are dooming too early. Not looking good right now but there's still more to play.,21
"Ponting to DC: go out and play like we did in 2003 WC finals 

Kaif shifts nervously",78
We haven't chased anything ver 160 successfully this season. Rip,10
good running bw wickets,5
Nadeem looks a little bit like Nawazuddin Siddiqui doesn't he?,4
Chad DC Openers vs Virgin SRH bowling attack,6
Only thing we don't need rn is sunny wanking off to dc,5
Everyone can see Rashid coming in the next over...,6
Yes DC! Win this for us!,2
Is this the best opening stand against SRH this season?,9
"If Delhi reach the finals, the cup will be decided by who wins Stoinis Vs Bumrah",4
Scott Styris prediction coming true,2
[deleted],9
DC fans never unclench. No one can beat SRH fans at reverse jinxing.,8
Feels like the perfect time for Rishab Pant to come back into form.,10
How different DC looks without Shaw.,7
Mumbai fans must be so relaxed in the knowledge that everyone else is panicking about their team’s chances when they’re easily going to win the IPL,11
Never dropped the catch,5
we lost the game in PP like DD lost last match against us with warner on song... Clearly revenge match,10
"Alright SRH. Breathe in for 6 seconds, hold for 4 and breathe out for 6",3
I had forgotten that Delhi was actually capable of batting,15
Let's see how SRH play when the target is > 165,8
Strategic timeout is annoying af. Breaks the momentum of the game.,7
"This will seem like an exaggeration but not losing a wicket in the first over plays a colossal role in the whole momentum of the innings. So Stoinis has done an incredible job. Pointing Shaw out is easy, but what about Rahane who is supposed to be a Test Specialist and he also was getting out in the First over only. Stoin the Man tho",10
Bringing in left arm spin in power play is always suicidal when a left hander (especially a high class batsman as Dhawan) is at crease. Off spinners are most effective in power play but not left arm spinners. They are never bowled in powerplay.,7
"Guys, I dont think Nadeem overstepped. It was a high ball right? seemed to have slipped outta his hand.  
Calling him  a cheat for ""overstepping"" as some have done is thora much ? right?",2
"They just need to go run a ball for 9 overs, get to 120 off 15 and then smack last 5 for 60. That's an easy 180. Just take a single off the next 54 balls",1
Please just play out Rashid Khan. No slogging,3
"Match isn’t over boys, let’s be patient and hopeful",9
Do NOT SEND RAHANE. Send PANT in.,8
This is already more than what SRH score after pp,5
Should've replaced Shaw sooner,2
This match is a dilemma. Do you want DC to win or MI to lose?,7
"Tewatia






Now send upvotes",5
"Gabbar is like that guy you see in the office who was very consistent for some time and then is part of every project. He will then become the guy you see in every meeting but not know what he actually does.

He will have glimpses of excellence and suddenly he will only do thigh slaps after meetings. After a while, as a Manager forming a project team, you will be like ‘thigh slap kaun karega’ and the answer will be ‘only Gabbar’.",8
Shaw as waterboy is best position for him,40
A DC fan was saying his dream was 70-0 in PP. There you go(almost),8
you remove shaw from the lineup and see what it does to DC's batting,14
This season Dhawan > Rahul,-1
Congrats DC. We're out. See you next year,7
Just in :  Paddikal to open with prithvi shaw for RCB in next season,9
Stoinis fired up after Shreyas did that impression of him,6
Why doesn't DC uses Mohit Sharma any idea.,2
Punter just realised Stoinis is a gun opener. Or this was the plan all along? 100D chess.,4
Dhawan was criticised for lack of intent™ before IPL and he is the only one from Indian batting order to show the intent™ in this IPL.,16
Shaw might poison Stoinis's drink lmao,7
"If SRH can't get past DC, they won't get past a full strength MI either. Having said that, the match is not over yet. Can't we discuss the finals once this match is over?",5
Kaif is pretty slim for a retired cricketer,10
"sad seeing Shaw Uncle carrying the bottles, he's depressed af",37
DC playing well again,2
This thread is even saltier than Hyderabadi biryani!,4
"SRH fans had really started being cocky

Take this onslaught now",5
"Oh boy, was waiting for this kind of powerplay for so long. I hope DC already had their quota of collapse in previous matches and introduction of Rashid doesn't trigger another one.",3
Delhi batting better than Mumbai batting confirmed? Or did Mumbai have an unlucky af day?,3
Shaw looks traumatized af,5
The fuck was that powerplay?,3
Pant tonking Rashid will be a cherry on the top.,5
"Fuck I didn't make any other plans for Sunday. I knew this is bound to happen when every body gave us a chance. There were posts on how everytime we won when rcb changed logo. There were patterns and what not. Thanks guys for jinxing the fuck out of us and no amount of reverse jinxing is going to save us. 

Good night Bois. I am going out for a run and sad it's not raining coz people will see me crying.",9
They will score 230+ I guess,3
"Don't tinker with current core DC, just get no 5 batsmen",3
"The JOSH ad of Jacqueline Fernandez is great! Totally non-cringe, extremely creative, absolutely not cringe app! Well done!!👏🏽👏🏽",8
do people actually think srh poses a threat to MI? They barely score less than 180 in first innings,9
"Who is everyone supporting for 2020 champion?

edit: MI for me ~~but I wouldn't mind them losing to SRH~~",5
Shahbaz Nadeem expected a to pull off another Moeen Ali with that no ball,3
I think this is probably the 2nd instance where we are looking to chase a huge target. Our targets set were mostly low scoring.,6
Baby Sehwag batting like a baby -Swann,4
"Random thought, but I don't like Swann as a commentator much. He goes for humour too much. Like in the last game, the tense last few overs. A football commentator would commentate accordingly and add to the tense environment or just pipe down and let the game play out. Swann was trying to crack jokes.",-1
"Before: Shaw is baby sehwag
After: Shaw is baby",7
"SRH got caught napping there. Now, they're hoping dew comes into the play in the second innings.",3
Is this similar pitch we played on Friday? Or its just our batsmen who shit bed against same opponent?,6
Shaw is like : opener is supposed to make runs?,14
Afghan jalebi,4
"Is Big Bash heavily commercialized too like uttering ""Yes Bank maximum "" ""Ceat time-out"" on every eventful thing",8
We need to restrict them for atleast less than 180,3
Stoinis strugglled agaisnt Zampa. Hope Rashid gets him,1
have a feeling rashid will take to cleaners today GG guys...,1
Guys who are you all supporting to win this year? Deep deep deep within your heart?,1
Bro tf is happening? I last saw the score when Holder dropped Stoinis.,7
"Me an MI fan happy with DC pounding SRH so that we don't face them.


Inner me: Shivers and hides under a bed seeing DC Openers",4
Attack Rashid. Get out.,4
Rashid going for under 10 in his 4 overs is the only way we can win this,2
Ah fuck wicket alert,3
Can't wait for Rahane/Iyer to come next and score 50 runs in 7 Overs 😍,9
"I can't decide which team to support today, like them both equally",9
DC trying to improve their record against Rashid.,4
I can see Dhawan murdering Rashid today,7
"Would be nice for delhi if rashid goes for something bloke 4-0-20-0

Dhawan needs to keep that sweep away.",9
And this is how you play in a powerplay,5
"If DC manage to take on Rash, SRH's confidence will be completely shattered.",2
Smol pp shaw vs chad 🅱️oinis,6
Rashid please take em out,2
"Singles of all the balls of Rashid will be accepted. Nothing fancy, dont lose the wickets.",3
3 balls 3 runs. Sensible way to play Rashid.,2
Delhi off to a great start. 65/0 after the powerplay. Looking good to score around 220,2
Warner : STOP THE RUNS.,4
"Game's a goner if we don't restrict them under 160, we don't even have saha",3
Hahahahaha,2
Stoinis needs to be careful he doesn't eat up a lot of balls after that brisk start,1
6,2
Lol 6,2
Lol,2
Suddenly SRH look like a 1 bowler bowling side.,5
Rashids Economy go Brrrrrr,7
Bro.....,3
Wtf,2
Nice six,4
Meme,6
UNACADEMY CRACKING 6,7
Massive fuck up,3
SRH are losing their head.,6
LMAOOO STOP IT NOW I CAN’T,6
"Wow: 1, 1, 1, 6",3
Classiest way to hit a six,7
rashid pissed,1
Too early to call but Holder dropped the match there. Delhi was not psychologically ready to lose that wicket in 3rd over. Other batters would have been thinking something along the lines of 150 runs instead of 180+ they are thinking now.,5
Top class meme team,7
Thank you Rashid...,4
SRH in shambles,5
This is going from worse to disastrous for SRH lol,2
"lol, that's pressure",3
Lolololol,3
World cup flashbacks,3
That's the only way Rashid can concede a six,2
Brilliant SIX!,3
What a stupid thing to do,7
Fuck fuck fuck.,4
Srh needs to slow things down...where is kano,2
Chutiya Rashid Khan.,2
Bro Rashid wtf!,3
Someone seriously did some black magic against SRH...,3
thas a 6,3
CHHAKA AGAINST RASHID BC lmao,7
Ok now get rekt Rashid loool,3
Lmao that’s some WC19 final shit,7
"Alright, as an MI fan which team would you want to face? We’ve already beaten DC 4 times, can we do it a 5th? On the other hand, SRH crushed us by 10 wickets and have been in great form.",1
Thanks Rashid,2
Hahahahaha fuck SRH,4
Everything going wrong for SRH,8
"Now that DC have the momentum, keep pushing Rahane down and move everybody else up the rest of the innings. Rahane is just there as an insurance policy that is not needed now unless they lose 2 in quick succession. 

Keep the pressure on by pushing Pant and Hetmyer up and let them maximize the second set of 10 overs. Keep the left right combination to negate Rashid in the middle overs.",6
SRH playing against SRH,2
Can someone remind SRH this is Qualifier 2,2
"Big yikes SRH

Rashid has given away more runs in 4 balls this game than he did in 4 overs vs Delhi last time",4
"Batsmen can’t score a six of Rashid’s bowling

Rashid: Fine,I’ll do it myself",18
SRH forgot how to cricket,8
What the actually fuck Rash?,2
"on one hand I want them to cunt rash to completely demolish srh's confidence, on the other hand they can let him be and not lose wickets",1
Lmao bye bye.,6
Dhawan pulled off a stokes,10
Overthrow. Rashid doing a Koach there.,5
Ok buddy RashidKhan,5
Jeez that's some way to hit a six.,3
Very nice Khan sahab,1
6 off Rashid!!,2
All batsman who have success against Rashid play the sweep well and it's easy to see why.,1
Warner is fucking pissed af,3
Rashid can only be mad at himself,6
Hope Rashid can deliver a performance like AFG v ENG (WC 2019).,1
On the brighter side we might finally get to see Warner unleashed in a 200+ chase.,4
Rashid why didn't you overthrow against us,6
"Catch drops  
Miss fields  
Free hit  
Over throws  

Guys Thanks",10
Lmao this is a trainwreck,2
Lmao. 4d chess of hitting 6 runs of Rashid without clearing the boundary at all.,6
Nadeem was trying to recreate bald guy meme after that horrendous throw.,2
Haha that six😂,6
🏳️🏳️🏳️🏳️🏳️🏳️🏳️🏳️,3
What’s going on.,1
"Gavaskar and Hate towards unnecessary throws will never get old. 

He absolutely hates them absolutely",3
Rashid already gave more runs than he gave in last match vs DC lol,11
Based Rashid,2
Imagine if final points table results took as long as US election results,0
"Ok, bye guys. It’s been fun. I don’t even want to watch this shitshow anymore.",8
This is just disappointing!,3
Rashid you alright mate? Is age getting to you?,3
[deleted],1
SRH body language looking terrible,1
DC repeating our innings on us.,12
Rashid gave away more in 4 balls then he did in 4 overs last time against DC,3
Dhawan kindly RESIST REVERSE SWEEP. We are going superbly.,9
DC already passed Rashid for runs in comparison to last match.,6
"Rashid is a poor fielder. Also SRH are crumbling and Warner can do nothing but smile.  
Seen him do that a lot today.  
  
He needs to get the Bull out",3
Goodbye SRH,6
Bring on Natarajan,5
That's it man even Rashid looks ineffective.,13
"11 from Rashid's over, just beautiful.",12
Khelo dimaag se.,3
I think SRH is getting desperate for a wicket and committing silly mistakes,8
[deleted],6
"SRH is jinxed very heavily, someone has bin tinkering with the biryani",6
"No 3 for 7 today, ouch",3
Not enough runs are scored against Rashid so he himself decided to give some,5
JAI SRI RAM LAGE RAHO DCCC BCCCCCC,1
"Oh, Jason You have dropped the IPL, Wouldn't blame you much though",4
Nayi Soch^TM award for Rashid,2
Stoin sledging Rashid mmm not good,2
Sunny G is right there in his old man ranting,11
All these SRH players still smiling to hide their pain is giving me life,8
Where my RCB fans at!? 🕺🏻🕺🏻🕺🏻,13
How did RCB bowl last match? Any chance they could have won in eliminator?,3
my fuck i love these two opening,5
"It was fun while it lasted, thanks SRH.
Congrats DC.",8
Who knew Shikhar was a Delhi agent when he played for SRH just to show up today against us.,4
"Tbf, the best 2 batsman of the tournament are out there for Delhi. We can still collapse. Though we might see fearless Iyer and Pant today.",13
Rashid giving batters 4 lol,7
Lol what a crap throw. If you try to imitate Kohli you're gonna end up losing like him too,20
Don't know if I should be glad we came till the second qualifier or angry that we're getting cunted after coming all the way till here.,7
We have done full circle of the IPL. SRH and DC are back to their start form,18
"Warner with that ""gaand lag rahi hai BC"" smile that I had after engineering exams.",20
Can someone make Sunil gavaskar stop with the good old days shit,3
"Thing with Rashid is, he sucks under pressure.",5
Necky boi's here,2
"SRH is losing it under pressure ... *if it bleeds, we can kill it*",5
"Its like Koach's soul has gotten into every SRH player today. 

Everything they touch is turning into shit.",12
WHAT THE FUCK DID I MISS ?!?,7
I'm calling a DC 0/2 against MI in the finals,5
Wow getting shaw out changed the whole ass mood of DC,5
One of the main reasons why srh won the previous matches is because their fielding was elite but today we're seeing the exact opposite,1
Will that count as an Unacademy super striker six?,4
"Well bois, I’m proud of SRH. Good job making it till here.",4
What tho fock dudes SRH,1
"I like how Delhi started playing shit so it went under everyone's radar and now they turned up and man this is something I never expected. Not gonna jinx it, keep boing my boys",3
[deleted],1
Rcb is too unlucky.,0
"So Stoinis opening works who knew.

*I have been calling for that since the beginning of the tournament*",8
"Ponting: Attack the bowlers so that you can play out Rashid and have a good score.  Dhawan: Okay, so attack the bowlers and have a good score.",10
I was hoping for week#7 DC team and week #2 team showed up :(,2
Just started watching. Who dropped whose catch?,3
Boys need to calm down,2
"Dhawan is playing faster than Stoinis, great to watch. 100 incoming",6
That rcb logo post jinxed us. These Delhi fans are playing 4D chess.,16
I hope this Delhi shows up in the final,5
Only Manish Pandey can win this game for SRH,3
"If Ponting wins the IPL with DC, I say name the Bar at Feroze Shah Kotla in his honour.",5
Can NNN deliver?,1
"If warner doesn't go bananas with the bat, srh has no chance

Getting 2018 watson vibes 😅",3
"Sunny g is like amitabh bacchan of Mohabbatein in comm box -

His 3 favorites 

1. Pratishtha - don't throw at stumps unnecessarily.
2. Parampara - spinner bowling a noball is criminal.
3. Anushashan - the moment any batsman forgets to drag his bat into crease while taking a quick run.",9
[deleted],2
Just don’t lose a wicket to Rashid. Even 10 off his remaining 3 and we win the game no questions asked,3
Dhawan wants to score fast today,1
Warner is due a century this season..,1
"Man, that Warner smile is unnerving. For a change, I wish to see him going MC, BC on the fielders like Kohli.",4
Time to bring in the BIG NUT,0
"Great stuff, step out just so the yorkers are rendered useless",6
"TIL when you remove a festering boil from your ass, you do so much better in life. WHO KNEW?",3
The sound off of stoinis's bat is crazy.,4
Thala grate ledgenry 😎🧠💪💪,0
Looks like SRH is tired of these back to back matches,3
"Rashid sucks as a fielder. Drops chances. Overdoes the dive and tumble to look spectacular.  
  
I said it.",1
Now that RCB got knocked out their spirit has escaped and possessed SRH.,8
SRH fans coming back to earth,3
"I love Gavaskar's commentary. 

""Fielders these days must have a shy at the stumps regardless of whether there's a chance of a run out. Supposed to show energy. ""

Even the other day when a player fell trying to grab a high catch: ""Nowadays everyone has to fall to the ground while attempting a catch"" 

🤣🤣",5
we can finally hope to put an end to all these crazy reverse jinxing comments.,4
[deleted],4
A boundary on this ball. Come on.,1
"Just tuned in, what's par score here?",0
I need Manish to go tuk tuk for the memes,2
"As a MI fan ,I am confused as who to support.",4
"SRH: get the best out of even the shittiest bowlers
RCB: get the worst out of even the best bowlers",2
This will allow Pant and Iyer to play freely as well so these fuckers have NO excuses today to not play at 150+ SR,12
Yorkers are in already,1
Rashid gave away more runs in one over than he does in an entire match,5
Send Pant in next.,2
"DC coming out with full intent today, what kinda spanking did Ponting give them after last match",10
"Off topic, can someone suggest some good biryani in Hyderabad? Also is there a veg option?(parents)",5
"Before Pandey ji comes to bat , someone just whisper in his ears that we are actually kolkata , might have a chance at losing by less margin",8
Srh team is panicking more than fans lol.,15
Not a single dot ball in 2 overs,9
At this point Rahane should bat at #7. Iyer Pant Hetmyer and Axar would bat ahead of him. Which isn't a bad thing,4
"Keep Iyer and Rahane as far away from batting as possible. Pant, Hetmyer go first.",6
Natrajan is pretty predictable,2
Want DC to win but Nattu to destroy their top order,5
Imagine Dhawan & Stoinis play well against MI too and take DC to their first trophy. Imagine because it ain’t happening in reality.,4
"No thanks Harsha, we dont need Axar at 3.",-2
"Dc fans - if not kotla, which other ground can host dc matches ..does that new stadium in noida counts ??",2
Ajinkya Tuk-Tukane is the only hope for SRH fans now.,4
Jinx is better than Rishab at this point.,1
I hope this means Pant will bat with freedom today,6
"The pitch looks absolutely flat..  No spin, No swing...


Hope the dew comes later in the day... 

Comeon Hyd, pull up lads...",3
Is that thala doing a line in the stands 😨😳😳,6
Dhawan: I don't usually open my account. But when I do..,9
Good over so far. I hope I don’t jinx it,4
shot dhawan,3
DC you better take this intensity to the final against Mumbai if you beat us.,7
3 ppl from the bottom 4 teams in the super striker lol,7
That came off the bottom of the bat,3
Seems like Ponting got his calls spot on tonight,3
ICC dhawan and his placement! Unmatchable,10
Gavaskar smoking weed,5
Someone convinced Sikkah Daone that this the only ICC tournament he will play this year.,6
"This performance so far by DC shows that RCB was odd man out. DC, SRH, MI are the three deserving teams in this year's IPL.",4
Getting 2019 world cup feels from this match. Totally unexpected.,1
we aren't out whyre you suggesting who to send next!?,9
That was right in the gap,4
Go the Mumbai way send discount Jadeja next,6
All over Bois. Cya next season,13
"Bas kar DC, kindly score inside SRH's aukat",6
Why was stoinis not opening till now bhenchod???,17
Run every ball boundary every over.,3
"Man, for everybody who shit on Iyer's decision to bat first. Looking like a masterstroke now.",9
"SRH : Gets hammered 

Warner : 🤓",41
Dhawan uwu,1
The scenes if DC fucks this start by sending in Rahane next.,0
salty rcb fans wanking off in this thread lol.,6
"If Warner is out early, SRH will be out early.",9
SRH fans needed to be humbled lmao,7
[deleted],-3
What a flick !,1
[deleted],2
Pitch looks flat and with dew later on Warner can chase it down single-handedly.,-4
Agent Bairstow injured so many players who compete for his spot but Davey is not naive like ECB.,9
Omg  please stop conceding boundaries:(,5
This delhi side if  i can beat Mi easily feeling nervous,2
Unrelated but is Jadeja in for the odi and t20 squad?,1
This is so hard to watch. Did our luck run out because we lost the toss and no one got injured to balance that 😑✋,6
I really wont mind both of these guys batting till the end also. Considering other batsmen are in average form,7
"I just want DC to take timeout at 16th over now, complete dominance in this 10 overs",4
The fucking Dukan se ad is back 🤮🤮,3
When did Kohli go from TVS to Hero?,3
At least they decided to drop Shaw for a proven t20 opener before it was too late lol,6
Can someone delete sunny g from the comm box,7
Will be visiting Hyderabad soon. Can anyone suggest some good places for biryani?,7
[deleted],0
You can see the fatigue on SRH players' faces,3
"Both SrH and DC had similar batting displays this year. When the top fires, you would think this team can chase any score. On other days reaching 130 odd becomes a herculean effort.",2
DC is doing what Kane did last game - run singles and put the loose ball away,1
Stoinis should play out the Rashid over and go for 20+ in the next over.,3
"People shouting for Stoinis. 


Me watching Dhawan bat with 200 strike rate.",8
Bruh they really made Dhoni into Bahubali in the Snickers ad,5
Dhoni with dreads looks absolutely dreadful,6
DC losing from this position will just be a new school of the art of bottling,5
Wicket this over,3
Dhawan looks more imperious than Pant or Iyer.,4
"Oof DC dominating so far. Did not expect this at all..

Stoinis opening was a great decision. Benching Prithvi ""Pure Garbage"" Shaw was even better.",5
They have to send Pant in next with no consequences. Just let go,7
This is the first season I've heard about Natrajan and I am pretty impressed. He has played well so far,8
2020 is weird after all. DC to win the trophy.,0
Dhawan has a lot better SR than KL in this IPL i believe.,2
Dhoni snickers ad cringe af,6
"This Dhoni add is a direct replica of the Snickers Ad in the UK. 

‘You turn into a right diva when you are hungry.’",3
3 wickets in next 5 overs is what we need right now.,2
Only good thing about the end of IPL is we won't have to bear these annoying ads anymore,5
Yes boy,2
[deleted],2
Cricbuzz says Delhi opted to bat? Wtf?,7
Looks like warner didnt sacrifice one of our player's hamstring before this game :(,11
:O,3
Send Pant,4
YRKFA strikes,4
Thank fuck for that,4
"First Wicket before 12th over , rahane/Iyer should come in

First Wicket after 12th over, pant/hetmyer",3
It’s not over yet man. Don’t spread doom and gloom,7
did rashid say behenchod loooool,15
YRKFA!!! let's goo.....,8
"fuck, lol",1
Yesssss,3
Wow what the fuck,5

That's Magic from Rashid,3
[deleted],3
Rashid sledging...lol bahut gand jali hia lagta hia,12
"Yeah boy, that's what we want",5
"Ohno. Why is Rashid so worked up, gosh dude",17
YRKFA is a beast,7
Oooooof,1
holy fuck thank god,3
Get the fuck out Stoin boi,5
Can’t keep rash quiet forever,3
Bhai Bolte Rashid bhai,7
Fuck yeah. Back in the game,5
Fucken Rashid Khan!,8
"Stoinis sledged Rashid. Lmao, Australians don’t learn",10
Hell yeaaaaaah. Fuck off please :),5
Kohli bowling leg spin?,1
What a ball,3
Masterpiece,2
Send Rahane next.,-1
Send pant send pant,1
PANT TIME,3
Stoinis did his job tho and Dhawan still there,5
Rashid you beauty,3
Young man is going to get grounded for saying bad words,1
man stoinis deserved a 50 😭,4
"I was rooting for DC cause I thought SRH would cause most problems, but hot damn. But damn the way these two are going.",3
"Ye RASHId. Pitch me se batsman nikalta h, aur khaali overs scoreboard pe chadha dia, chadha dia..",1
Good innings stonkis .. pant your turn now,3
Get wrecked,1
Patel bhai next plz,1
Rashid 💦💦💦💦💦,5
This is why you don't sledge the Khan,6
"Go chargers, go orange army. Come back stronger pls",4
Okay revised target: 163,7
"**8.2** Rashid Khan to Stoinis, OUT, that is a ripper. Rashid gives SRH the relief they need **86-1**

MP Stoinis  b Rashid Khan 38 (27b 5x4 1x6) SR: 140.74",3
"Rashid’s just too good. Nonetheless, thanks Stoin for the great start!",2
"Rashid You Should Not Have Done The Age Blunder....

You Are The Goat Spinner Of IPL, please dont so this things",2
Googly-master is back in business bois.,3
Felt we should have used a spinner like Nadeem early in the PP against Stonis. Like the 3rd or 4th over.,6
On spot googly,2
Time to initiate collapse srh let's do it,4
Fuck off you fucking cunt.,-3
Rashid Looking furious today,2
Whyyy Iyer ugh,2
Pan go crazy today plz,4
Damn was Rashid tryna pick a fight with Stoinis there? Rashid’s a great bowler but you don’t mess with those guns bro,7
He does that celebration often. Why was this different?,4
Iyer is coming in,2
That's magic right there. You needed magic to get this brute of a man out and Rash did just that.,5
YRKFA you beauty!,3
No problem still better than shaw,4
Send Iyer and not rahane pla,1
That was a very ungainly dismissal,3
Should send Hetmyer now,1
Srh need to do a 2016 final comeback here,5
Rashid is an absolute cheat code,5
Iyer or Hetmyer would be better option here. Rahane will suck the momentum out of the game.,3
Us reverse jinxing so that somehow we reach the finals and then we see this assault leave us with a surprised Pikachu face,2
SEND PANT,1
"Rashid is so nice, until his economy goes over 6.",1
"I audibly gasped at that in a very sexual way

Currently wondering whether my housemates heard",2
Inb4 collapse,1
Ok boysssss letzoooooo,1
"As long as Dhawan is there, nothing will change.",3
That ranveer singh jio rap is garbage,7
Wow Rashid,1
"Iyer, Oh fuck off man",2
Delhi please don't deaccelerate,6
[deleted],2
Stoin vs YRKFA is not the fight we need,2
Holy shit that's 2005 Adobe Flash level animation in that Canara Bank ad!,3
Iyer walked in time for test match.,2
Was Rashid calling Stoinis a behnchod while sending him off?,5
"Feeling like Delhi got the start they wanted, it's upto their bowling really now",2
Iyer doesn’t want to mess his hair in a cap,3
predicted score for DC at this point?,1
"send in Pant, DC shoudnt lose the momentum now",3
Rashid should have bowled no 5 instead of shahbaz,5
That camera on wheels moving in the background innocously always makes me laugh for some reason,2
It was fun while it lasted,2
tf Dhawan reached 45 already,2
Rahane specialist fielder today,3
Intent Iyer today,2
there’s always something sexy about helmetless batting,2
Rahane specialist fielder today,3
Is it just me or has Iyer become more and more stoic these days?,2
[deleted],1
Iyer in to give SrH a chance to get back in the game. Good guy Iyer,1
Shreyas byer,2
Shreyas wants to flaunt his haircut. Scores some runs too while you’re at it?,3
I was watching with no sound... To just don't disturb my family... For a sec I turned on volume... And it's a wicket😂😂😂,2
RASHID KHAN YOU BEAUTY,4
Is it just me or has Iyer become more and more stoic these days?,1
What did Rashid say to Stoinis,1
atleast didn't try to defend,2
"Rahane - The finisher!!


Heard it first here",2
" It's fun to see Rashid panicking when people take him for runs. 

Getting wickets he gets too confident. Take him for runs. 
It's fun for others.",5
Which morons came up with that rummy circle ad?,1
Which morons came up with that rummy circle ad?,2
Rashid is such a fucking clutch bowler,1
New to the sub. Anyone else believes SRH gets the cup?,1
Rashid is such a fucking clutch bowler,3
"You don't take a foot to the pitch of ball to avoid lbw hence provide enough gap for the ball to sneak in...
Tough if you aren't sure which way it's turning.",2
Bruh what the fuck kinda unplayable shit is Rashid bowling,4
Hm the day seems ripe for being a toxic Delhi fan but i guess I'll wait,6
Rashid is such a fucking clutch bowler,5
Time for another clueless 29(38) by Shreyas. Love to see it every match not in Sharjah.,3
Dc to crumble and getting draged to 150.,3
"Hope they had sent Rishabh Pant in.

We would have got to listen to ""Reee-shabh, Reee-shabh"" chants.",3
Time for another clueless 29(38) by Shreyas. Love to see it every match not in Sharjah.,2
"“Great positions with Rashid Khan” 

okay",3
Indians are supposedly the best players of spin. Two back to back googlies completely deceived,2
Goswami having a very bad day behind the wickets. Probably will give his wicket away too. We are fucked if they score 160+,3
Goswami having a very bad day behind the wickets. Probably will give his wicket away too. We are fucked if they score 160+,2
"Bowler: Imma sledge Gabbar to break him down.  
Gabbar: 😁",2
Dc to crumble and getting draged to 150.,1
Rashid is such a fucking clutch bowler,2
Why don't some batsmen wear helmets?,4
Don't think we ( Delhi) have it in us to beat Mumbai but it would be sweet if we finally managed to get to the final.,4
"Guys, just logged in. Was literally was about ask - WTF is happening. Looks like it's back to Normal with Rashid doing Rashid things...",3
How is Rashid such a good wrist spinner and Kuldeep sucks so bad at it? Can India not get a proper spinner to work with the Quicks.,7
What an over,1
One more SRH bowler should step up & support Rashid. Apply the pressure now,2
Come on bois let's restrict them below 160,0
"Sad that with all these commentary options the IPL offers they don’t have raw stump mic feed. 

Hopefully one day",3
"Please play Rashid out DC, he’s one of the best bowlers playing right now. Don’t give him a wicket, don’t care if he bowls two maidens!",2
I was watching with no sound... To just don't disturb my family... For a sec I turned on volume... And it's a wicket😂😂😂,1
Rashid is such a fucking clutch bowler,3
"Nadeem? not natarajan, why warnie?",2
"Sad that with all these commentary options the IPL offers they don’t have raw stump mic feed. 

Hopefully one day",9
Imagine if Rashid was Indian. He would be so much popular.,5
Love the aggressive Iyer. Hate that passive Iyer. Absolutely Despise that Iyer ad,2
"No. I see a bit more of the arm bent in one of the deliveries Swanny.  
Not just the fingers and stuff",3
[deleted],4
Rashid is such a fucking clutch bowler,8
Shreyas Iyer is such a hippie,7
"I'm all for either DC or SRH (preferably the latter) giving Papa MI a spanking in the finals, but there's something much more exhilarating seeing an IPL final with two kits of completely different color. Blue on blue feels like when I'm versing myself in Wii tennis",5
"Chutiyon helmet pehno naa, koi marega tab hi mandatory karoge kya?",8
Gabbar op,2
Do you guys think Rashid ran into the same problem effecting jofra this year? Being the only gun bowler on the team. Of course its much worse for jofra.,1
Imagine if Rashid was Indian. He would be so much popular.,3
And now time for the comeback. Oh cricket.,1
"Dhawan, you beauty 51(26).",6
"As much as I feel bad for Prithvi Shaw, I was desperately hoping to witness a meme-level performance today of 0(4).",9
sun's going down,3
Dhawan delivered again. 200SR wow,6
Is there anything more satisfying than a left handed batsman slog sweeping a left arm spinner,2
"Great shot, I told DC fans yesterday. Gabbar will show up in important matches. Great innings Gabbar",3
I haven't followed IPl much this season. Why is everybody panicking that Iyer is on?,5
Mf just doesn't stop,5
Dhawan a gift,3
Dhawan's 3rd 100?,6
Dhawan is gonna take that orange cap from rahul and teach him a lesson.,7
Delhi chasing MI's 200 today.,10
Convince Rashid to get Indian citizenship,12
Dhawan is eating Nadeem for breakfast,5
"Finally one out of Kohli, Rohit and Dhawan comes good in the knockouts.",8
Dhawan only deals in ducks or 50+ scores,9
"ok this guy had too many ducks, seems like he chose srh to score a century against.",8
This season Dhawan > Kl,5
"Great, now Iyer will tuk tuk until DC only get to 150 by 20.",0
Remember this Nadeem from DD lol,6
"You got a breakthrough pile on it my dude, don't bowl a left arm spinner to Shikhar instead",3
Bad fielding from jas tonight. Hope he compensates with the bat,1
Who's on Dugout?,2
Dhawan thinks this is a icc event...,6
"Shikhar gonna bury us tonight, i can clearly see him getting a 100 tonight.",4
Icc dhawan turned up today,6
"why SD, why you hate your ex-team?? crying orange tears...",5
Holder looks clueless,3
Just hope Iyer doesn't put pressure on Dhawan,3
"Of all the young blokes in DC, I have only faith in Dhawan to complete a double safely without panting like has just ran a Marathon",8
Wtf is holder doing on the field?,2
"> If everyone does MBA , wouldn't that just cause salaries to crash due to excessive supply vs demand

Actual comment in this thread.",11
"Great stop, well-done. Hope Jas us alright",3
"inb4 

shikhar dhawan century",5
Rashid could have gotten 3 wickets with some luck. What an over!,7
"Wow, that's some good piece of fielding be Samad.",3
Samad is a fucking bipolar fielder.,9
Literally everything going against us,2
Warner crying inside for letting go dhawan?,5
No Agent Bairstow No,5
"Waiting for Harsha to say ""Left handed spinner to left handed batsmen . . .""",9
Wtf is wrong with nadeem? Why is he bowling full tosses,9
Yea bowl left arm to left handed,2
"After the brohit/Nohit line, what's the  TheOne/DeadOne line?",11
Dhawan forcing Nadeem to give up bowling and stick to making team on Dream XI,17
Holder is so clumsy bc of his height,8
ICC Dhawan?😳,3
"Tbf it's kinda dumb to think that Indians should play spin well just because of the conditions they play in, do we expect English people to play fast bowlers well?",8
"KL Rahul: 670

Dhawan: 580* 

Warner: 546*",12
Dhawan on his way to take that orange cap,6
Oh no please don't shake your hand like that in front of your mouth Shikhar,6
What happened to holder? Didn't look like anything hit him,3
Is it just me or Rashid looks sick,5
Jason 'unable to hold bat' holder now? After the injury?,7
If Dhawan plays the 20 over today it's over for sunrisers Bois,4
Why does Warner keeping bowling left armers to Dhawan,3
Lol Dhawan’s signal for water is hilarious,12
Lmao Swann was almost about to say Holder just stood there like a dumbass,5
[deleted],3
Only two runs ? It felt soo long,3
"Ok guys, my team was eliminated. I'm a neutral. Whom do I jinx tonight?",5
"DC and SRH, fans of both sides are saying that Shikhar is gonna score a 100

Ofc one is trying to reverse jinx",6
gabbar polishing his head to play cool and collected shots,3
[deleted],0
"Dhawan is in great touch this ipl...but how about his fitness ?? 

May not be the most dynamic in the field but he is a good runner.",2
kL and Dhawan are the only form batsmen for India. FML.,10
Sunsetters Hyderabad.,16
"Smile please Rash, that's your strength :))",7
I can already see Dhawan going for a reverse sweep on Rashid and getting caught out :((,9
Dhawan showed up when it really really really mattered,18
feels bad for stoinis man,9
"If Dhawan gets the orange cap, we win the tournament",6
Shreyas Iyer looks like a scared kid around demanding parents when he's around Ponting.,6
Should have sent in Hetmyer or Axar and gone for the kill IMO. Makes no sense to send in a conservative right hander like Iyer against two bowlers who turn the ball away from the right hander.,6
Come on DC 70 more and you will have an excellent chance,8
"So, we are looking at Delhi playing lame duck against MI again?",1
Fuck Rashid for being rude to ma boi Stoinis,13
Dhawan needs 90 runs to beat kl rahul. Will he???,7
Shit just went from bad to worse for srh!!!,7
Time for score prediction. Mine is around 170-180. What do you think?,1
Give Nattu pls. Don’t be tempted by Rashid.,2
"Just curious, does reverse reverse jinx work at this stage?",5
Sunrisers will lose since the Sun has already set,12
So Rahane definitely a specialist fielder for today right?,3
"Trump score : 214
DC score : 215",13
Inb4 rahane comes in 15th over and scores at 6 rpo,6
"Good launching pad for the rest of batsman, hope they make the most out of it now!",4
They will easi get 200+ from here,6
"So 225 is the projected score, Amitabh knew all along",6
So Kane has to strike at 150 for us to win today. Nice,10
Dhawan has only 2 mode 0(1) 100(50),94
"i went out after 1st over  
 WTH am I seeing",5
"Bish: Capitals at the bottom of the Fairplay table. Shreyas Iyer won't be happy with that.


Oh you sweet summer child.",4
"DC looks absolutely unchallenged by SRH bowlers. 
Even Rashid looks ineffective for a bowler of his caliber.",4
Sup with the tuk tuk playing style of indian players recently ?,2
NSFW IPL: Swanky Indian 'asks for a drink' staring Shikar Dhawan,8
Next up is hetmeyer. Dc are getting 225 today .,5
whenever Rashid sledges we lose. Not complaining about sledging tho. Need some spice.,13
I'm terrified of rashid,6
Rashid has a mean streak in him. Love to see as a spectator.,9
"Rashid will be a big loss for the final if he is suspended, not to worry Bairstow is a bit of a tweaker too and will rip them just fine.",2
"I was pushing for promoting Stoinis for opening since the start of the season, as he did in BBL. And now, when he did - he was BANGGGG",3
[deleted],17
The orange cap for which KL sacrificed his team might end up going to Dhawan after all lmao.,15
LMAO bangar got confused,4
"Shreyas can't hit fast bowlers to save his life, wtf is he doing - just smash Nadeem and Rashid, that's why he came in early right?",11
Wtf is rasid doin,5
I think Rashid Khan raising his eyebrows and smiling at the replay of him sledging Stonis is **chefs kiss**,10
Shreyas playing a tuk tuk captain's knock. Just need chonky pant to pick up the slack.,5
WTF is YRKFA trying to do,12
do not give wicket,1
Rashid going for one tip one hand,23
Raa-shidd.. Raa-shidd.. Raa-shidd!,5
r khan tryna injure himself,14
Rashid is hyper today,12
Oh boy. Rashid needs to calm down.,14
"Earlier today, on Insta, Dawood posted a picture of his youngest daughter who was understandably missing him and he tagged his family and wrote ""Daddy will be home soon"". 

That little girl's wish >>> an orange army of reverse jinxers wish",17
Is Rashid high? Why is he so worked up?,9
SRH caught some of that RCB curse from their last game,7
Just one more left of Rashid,3
Just one real over left for SRH. We can target 200 now,8
gud! just tuk tuk rashid,7
"Can't wait for people to scream after the Finals 

 SrH DesErVED tO bE iN thE FINaLs",14
[deleted],-19
How costly that Saha's injury would prove,17
The young blood in Rashid Khan is boiling today,5
Imagine if koach decides to play at 4 again to accommodate kl,6
Iyer replicating koach by killing the momentum,3
"20 runs & a wicket of 3 overs off Rashid, I'll take it considering our record against him this IPL",5
"Iyer is no hurry, 30 more overs to go",8
"Shreyas Iyer is like Virat Kohli if Kohli had never scored 70 centuries and had begun with his ""slow accumulation in T20"" style before achieving anything in life",6
"dhawan evokes the same feeling in me abd evokes in rcb supporters, feels like he be the batting backbone",6
Shreyas used to be DC's (and probably even new India's) best players against spin. What happened :/,7
"Pls send Hetmyer next.
PLEASE.",4
"Shreyas Iyer is like Virat Kohli if Kohli had never scored 70 centuries and had begun with his ""slow accumulation in T20"" style before achieving anything in life",9
Iyer killing momentum.. again..,5
Must say Iyer will ensure DC don't reach 200.,3
Should have sent Hetmyer.. wasting the advantage,2
henlo it's your bowling hand,2
Every India player are tuk tukin like msd in the middle Over. Just play your natural game Bois.,3
I have the same hair and beard as Nattu🥴,1
Harsh call I think,1
Iyer + Rahane is what I want at the crease. Please make that happen.,1
C'mon Delhi 190+ and we're off to finals,2
Stoinis took revenge of knocking out Zampa team,3
Rashid showing some of that Tahir energy lol.,3
"Not sure how DC is going to handle Rahane's position in the lineup now. They need to send Pant, Hetmyer right after.",6
Iyer here to improve bowlers' economy,6
Rashid is on speed today.,4
Punter needs to have a chat with Iyer the same way he did with Dhawan when the latter was playing slow,10
Subcontinent Players played spin with ease. Nowadays they struggle against spin more than SA batsmen,7
Natarajan is Reddit's poster boy with that sexy neck-beard.,6
"""AjInKyA rAhAnE wOuLd hAvE rUiNeD tHe mOmEntUm"" , Iyer be like I'll do it myself.",27
"Iyer mere mitr, please keep the momentum up. Dont brake, Rahane also has to come, pls",6
"Don't know what Pant and Hetmeyer are talking, Rabada doesn't seem to be interested at all!!!",8
"Win the toss, bat first.

Play Stoinis as opener.

Play your worst bowler as a leggie because they get wickets anyway. 

Wow Delhi woke up or some shit!",11
STOP THE COUNT!,22
Sending Iyer was a mistake!,8
[deleted],8
Name a more iconic duo than Stoinis and getting out to bowlers named Rashid,13
"Rashid is better off not squaring up against Stoinis. 

Ek maar pada Stoinis ka, toh uthega nai.",8
"Rabada in shorts looks like an innocent kid in a school, lol",16
Why is Nattu not yorking? Nothing going right for SRH.,4
This start should ensure 200 with such depth but many of our Indian players make sure to practise for test.,6
What happened to Shreyas Iyer?,3
Iyer needs to move on now. Has played himself in enough I feel.,7
Two massive underpeformers are good friends it seems in Pant and Hetmeyer,3
WTF is Discount Virat Kohli doing?,18
"DC: oolala 200+ on the board today!

Iyer: Hold that thought fellas not under my watch",3
Need Shikhar D's wicket asap,7
"Iyer, my boi, it's yer time shine plx.",10
SRH should restrict DC to 180 or else the game is gone,1
First let Iyer bat a little bit then judge if it was a mistake to send him or not,9
why is iyer playing test?,4
Shouldn't a left hander have come instead of iyer considering the overs of nadeem and rashid left,8
Dc should look to get 225 plus and not settle for 200. Just bat srh out of the game . Srh def capable of chasing 200.,12
So many salty comments in this thread?,8
Less than 200 is going to be a disappointment but wouldn't surprise me,4
Will they give Nadeem his 4 overs?,2
"Best IPL seasons for Dhawan:

1) 582 runs, SR: 147.7 (2020)

2) 569 runs, SR: 129.6 (2012)

3) 561 runs, SR: 127.8 (2013)

4) 521 runs, SR: 135.7 (2019)

5) 501 runs, SR: 116.8 (2016)

Career runs: 5525

Career SR: 126.7",18
An in form free scoring Dhawan is good for india as both rohit n koach take time tk shift gears.,3
Iyer loves doing this,2
Get Dhawan out and we have a chance of restricting them to 180-185.,1
"You know why nattu isn't bowling yorkers? Because dhawan has been constantly stepping out, fucks with the bowlers mojo",3
"Iyer is doing great, he should anchor Dhawan is already attacking",5
Iyer might just be starting to suck out the momentum out of DC's innings after that electric start by Stoinis and Dhawan.,9
Iyer and the crazy shuffling,0
abbeyy kya hua,1
[deleted],6
Yep! The dancing Iyer is here.,4
Really wish we had Shankar rn. Having a 6th bowler allows us to rotate away from the bowler who is going for runs(today it’s Nadeem).,5
Iyer fucking hit or get out. Stop fucking around BC!!!,1
Iye might be a good candidate for dancing with the stars,7
"Iyer doing chutiyapa in this game as well.

BC hit or get out!",3
"""baat to sayii aeee"" eat more balls amigo😘",5
Dc batting so shit they need to play rahane to avoid collapse.,0
Imo the reason kohli bottled as a batsman this tournament is probably because his wife is pregnant and that is completely understandable as a human being,-2
Dhawan is feeling the pressure now. Overtrying stuff.,3
"If we restrict them for less than 200, that's a decent job from here on",7
Bhai Iyer kuch kar bhai,5
Dhawan about to loft one in the air,2
Doing pseudo gambling to get an opportunity to make an absolute jackass of yourself on the telly is some proper village stuff.,2
If Rahane comes next I am gonna start crying,3
Miss my economy<6 bois,3
"Oh God, please not Rahane next!",2
"This is the thing i have hated the most this season, people playing anchor when they don't need to",4
I just hope rahane doesn’t come on next,2
Time to take those pads off Ajinkya,9
"I wonder what ponting might be thinking while listening to kaif...

I assume he n his team always assumed him to be a walking wicket in their playing days.",3
I dread to think what DC would have scored had Khaleel played.,0
Shreyas what is you doing baby,6
Bruh wtf Pant looking like a fucking Halwai,10
[deleted],2
So when is dhawan going to try his switch hit?,2
[removed],76
Next over two Iyer sixes or a wicket,5
"Dhawan's injury was a huge blowback for India, in the 2019 World Cup.",9
Ma boi iyer playin it for the orange army! You go man!,6
Hoping for a Thala innings from Iyer today,7
Yesss run rate below 10 for once in this game moral victory,8
So Goswami is our Stokes today?,5
Shreyas is sasta VK,2
SRH should set the mark at 200. Look at a score of 200 and think about defending it. It creates positively each time you restrict the opponent to a low scoring over.,2
"If Warner and Kanos get out early, samad and garg should fire up. There is nothing to lose anyway and I would like to see samad hitting some sixes",3
Pandey > Iyer confirmed,1
Nadeem will get a wicket here,1
How do India plan to win any t20 WC with Iyer and Pandey? These guys suck any sort of momentum out of the game as soon as they come out to bat.,4
Send Hetmyer next idiots,1
Bowlers should feel safe in front of Iyer. He won't hit you unless you are a spinner who is bowling full.,5
Time to take those pads off Jinks,7
Don't worry co-fans of  SRH. Everything going according to plan for Warner to win that Orange cap.,5
Good keep going like this and maybe you can do a collapse and fuck off below 160 after such a good start.,2
Kaif is always whispering to Ponting like Wormtongue.,3
"Please keep Shreyas in.  
He's like the human version of an anti-viagra.  
If the total is getting erect, he just deflates it",2
Bhenchod Iyer smash Rashid back to Kabul,7
Shreyas Iyer playing the most typical Shreyas Iyer innings,9
That start will get wasted man,0
Apparently Pahul Gill is back? Is it true 👀👀,3
Iyer is taking his time to get his I in.,3
"What pleasure does Natarajan derive of that disgusting looking beard? 

The lad should tidy up and appear more groomed for his own sake.",9
Does srh not have a 6th bowler,2
DC has come out swinging and surprised all in their quest to get pulverised by MI again.,3
"If Pant is next in, his performance could determine the game. If he hits form, dc have probably won this. If he plays like he's played every other game this season, that could cost dc massively",4
Pant < Kishan?,8
"Dhawan got intimidated by warner, bairstow and now seems to have a point to prove. Fucker chose the wrong match smh",4
"Dhawan has only 2 gears apparently, 0 and 100*",8
Shreyas liability Iyer at it again,-1
"With more and more stats being presented in the dugout each match, 

I reckon next IPL we're gonna see how much the players' dick curves and how it affects their performance on the off side.",3
The sound of that battttt oof,1
I'm so excited to see our Indian team of accumulators in Australia!!,4
Surely you need to open with Dhawan in Australia as he doesn't take that much time to settle and can attack straight away.,4
Dhawan is the only current Indian cricketer who plays sweep shot?,4
Iyer 🤝 kohli. Killing the momentum in the middle overs.,8
Shreyas playing tuk tuk aaah normalcy,2
"Iyer hasn't even been cunting spinners since the last couple of matches, sad",5
So the only full time team to not make the finals of IPL will make it today,2
The fuck are they doing,2
Absolutely sucked out the momentum,1
Some sage advice for DC: go after everyone not named Rashid,7
"Iyer is trying and I am fine with that. Gotta do more than that tho, gotta finish strong",6
Iyer bkl. Pant aur Hetmyer are sitting in the dugout. Maar yaar,4
"Bangar & the word ""literally""

Name a more iconic duo.",5
200 target is now downgraded to 175,-1
Delhi losing the rhythm here,0
Give Sandeep an over next. Pls don’t be tempted by Rashid.,2
16(22) Iyer today?,0
"People shouldn't be harsh on dc

Even mi slowed down after a gr8 start for a few overs, it was after 14 overs they started firing

Plz wait till innings gets over",8
Iyer plays against us or some shit. Absolute useless innings so far.,2
"Chill guys Iyer is capable of hitting 4 sixes in an over, he will make for it",8
"best case for SRH, Dhavan gets out and Rahane comes in and DC trundle to 160 from here",6
Please beat MI in the finals too guys..,8
How's the pitch lookin lads?,2
Threading the needle Iyer,7
SD will really go after nadeem,2
What placement ... perfect,3
[deleted],3
Fuckin hell DC bat deep. Less than 200 is  gonna be good for us,5
"We are done for, we cannot chase 180 or 190. DC beat MI for us in the final.",4
That placement was sexy,1
How was Iyer in 2018/2019 in IPL  ? Better than SKY ?,3
Nice fielding srh. Just loving this.,8
Well looks like shaw ate all the biryani out of Hyderabad today,8
Top level shit housery here,9
"Iyer

Dotball Iyer

Dot ball Single run Iyer

Dot ball Single run Double Run Iyer

Dot ball Single run Double Run 4 runs Iyer

Dot ball Single run Double Run 4 runs 6 run Iyer",14
That was funnier than it had any right to be,9
Garg you fool,6
OOOOYYYYY FUCKIN GET OUT YOU BC MC. IYER NEEDS TO GO,5
"More than the bowling, the fielding is beyond shit at this time.",3
"Iyer if he ever pops on this thread, will be delighted at being compared to Koach and Dhoni.",6
Both fielders giving guard of honour for that shot,8
"Ponting be like if anyone asks, it was your decision to send Iyer in.",9
Sloppy fielding. Either could have stopped it. Neither did,8
How far did Manish run!!,3
I've always thought iyer was supposed to be a great LOI prospect and even future captain for India. What's happening?,4
"Shreyas ""kill the momentum"" Iyer",4
"Iyer is far fitter than say Shaw or Pant, why not try doubles?",6
Par score Vs SRH already,11
Garg's inexperience in the field prevented Manish to take that dive. He didn't pull out early giving Manish the space. Would have been a collision.,7
"Guys like Root don't get to be part of England T20i lineup because they all go guns blazing. If anyone tries to go guns blazing in India, he is made to bat like Kohli Jr. because his own style is ""irresponsible"".",12
Minimum 80 runs in last 7 overs..,4
fuckin finally,1
Legit thought my stream was glitching when camera panned on Warner running backwards,4
SRH will come with Sandeep next over. Can Dhawan hit 16 off him?,0
Iyer applying his geometry skills to pierce mid wicket boundary.,4
[removed],-8
That misfield was an equivalent of that Amit Mishra Lenskart ad.,10
If they send Rahane next I'll kms,3
Thank god neither dived. I’d rather avoid a possible injury than save two runs.,8
That would have required an ambulance if they both kept going.,7
Iyer the momentum killer,1
Iyer starts accelerating veryyyy slowly. Maybe that's the kind of style Kohli prefers in the India team and maybe Iyer is no better than my boss (typical corporate ass kisser) but this isnt good for Delhi,2
"Would srh still open with Goswami or there could be a change ??

Warner - pandey 
Warner - kano 
Warner - garg 
Warner - samad 


Anyone ?",6
"Ya there is no way we chasing anything above 200, good luck in the finals dc",5
Delhi is batting like - tunk tunk tun tara ra,1
"*SRH looks like losing*

Literally everyone: WTF who's gonna beat MI in final now",13
"Pehle aap, pehle aap!",6
"SRH slowly build momentum. I believe Holder and Nattu can close the games for us properly. 

Give Sandeep an over.",3
GoodBye Risers,4
Half-full glass perspective there is better it went for 4 than an ugly collision that takes out both Pandey and Garg.,3
"They wouldn't have got the ball.... they might have had a meet-cute, though.",2
Surya would have made 24 (15) by now. Iyer is botching this innings with a 16(15),6
They dubbed over Pant's voice in that ad. Ouch,3
I have never seen koach playing a sweep shot like ever....,1
MBA != tarraki upgrad,1
Warner is smiling but dead inside,5
"What mental gymnastics from Iyer fans today, I wonder. 

Can't use the ""he came in at the fall of an early wicket"" excuse. He literally walked in at 100/0 in 10. 

Situation didn't demand to score 10 off 12 balls. No reason to play anchor. 

Is it gonna be the same ""But but but he scored 60 against New Zealand in February""?",9
Wtf is an antivirus fan?,7
Dhawan is such a big game player,10
Maybe real IPL trophy is the players we injured along the way!,6

🌤⛅️🌥☁️,2
"Even if DC loses all their wickets scoring no more runs, we'll still struggle to reach this total lmao",4
Everything setting up perfectly for MI,3
Perfect platform for a 200+ score and Iyer is fucking it up lol,2
Now just watch Delhi win this match comprehensively and then choke against MI smh,3
Harsha sounding annoyed .... time for **yet another**... CEAT tyre strategic timeout.,3
200 minimum if iyer gets over next over.,1
DC you better win against MI next match.,1
 anything under 210 after the start they had is underwhelming,6
Biggest conflict: love DC but want someone to thrash and beat MI in final so ..,2
"There's no question about it I've been saying it since he got selected in Indian team for T20I If you're taking singles and blocking in 18th over with 8 wickets to go no you're not good.

He couldn't even face Bangladesh's bowlers Blocking them like it was Glenn McGrath on the other side.

Yeah you get one or two or good innings in which you manage to get your SR above 128 but that's it. Luck He doesnt have the skills for a good T20 batsman Manish Pandey is a better version of him but no we have Shreyas as our number 4. Glorious sr of 120 And the commentators just love to cream all over him. They talk about that one innings he belted santner all over the park.

Today's poll

Most exciting DC player

Who won?

Shreyas freking iyer with 44% Yeah very exciting singles",7
Govinda has made even 30 sec dance in that ad entertaining,4
I believe if SRH restrict them around 175....they could still win,2
I wonder if cricketers ever chuckle at the nonsense we collectively spew sometimes here on this sub.,3
"Which ever one of DC or SRH wins, I hope they crush MI.",2
DC inflate deflate strategy worked,1
Turning out to be a humbling disaster for us,6
Warner & Williamson need to open for SRH,2
"Guys chill, Pant and Hetmyer aren't really in good form. Iyer can accelerate. You can't just smack every ball, they have to be careful. Natarajan Holder and Rashid and easily pull things back.",5
"Edtech is such a filthy immoral business. They are the same as all those fraud gurus, leeching off people's insecurity. Fuck Byjus",9
"Yes Jacqueline, I can also do dance!! Thing is, I won't upload it on JOSH! My god",5
Damn the height difference.,3
Restrict them to 165 please🐽,2
Did Dhawan asked to be traded to Delhi? Or did SRH voluntarily gave Dhawan for Shankar Nadeem and Sharma?,2
Time to target Holder,1
2 sixes over,3
"On the bright side, holder isn’t injured enough to not play",8
Iyer has to get a move on. That boundary was okay but it is not okay after that impressive foundation,2
Iyer single handedly has made 200 not reachable,3
So DC will post a total way more than our choke zone (120-140),5
SRH should open with Manish Pandey he’s the first Indian player to score a 100 in IPL against Deccan chargers.,2
"What’s the point of Iyer’s innings? 9 fucking wickets left with only 7 overs to go. Dhawan is holding one end and you have yourself and then Pant, Hetmyer and Rahane to come. Fucking piece of shit playing like this every fucking game. Doesn’t deserve to be in the team let alone captain",7
Warner is looking like a midget next to holder,6
"Looks like this is the end of the road for us, Boys.

Even though we aren't gonna make it, I wish to see Davey, Kanos, Holder go down fighting in a blaze of aggressive glory in the second innings",15
Stop shitting on Iyer idiots give him time ffs,7
Iyer does not look like he will explode ever. i mean ever in his career.,2
Was such a good platform to hit hard. And Iyer is here taking singles and three better batsmen are in the dugout.,7
Well the question is will we see the real pant after this,3
Iyer can only justify this innings if he does a Tewatia now.,7
Dugout still believes Holder has Bumrah-esque tendencies after the RCB batsmen made him look like Bumrah,6
This pubesy beard looks great Nararajan...said no one ever?,4
"17(16), just lol.",2
Iyer better get to 70 off 38 or something after sapping the momentum .,6
Scenes if it turns out to be our middle order's day and they score with a rr of over 7,6
"15 balls is more than enough to get going in a T20.  
If Warner fires than this innings will be the culprit",5
Most disappointing development is Iyer's gone quiet vs spinners. I was so kicked looking at an Indian batsman smoking spinners out of the park.,9
[deleted],9
I felt honoured today because I got recognised on r/memes from r/cricket lol,2
"I'd want to see Pandey opening with Warner with kane at 3, his best position.",1
"Iyer ain't settling , he is struggling here..",2
The IPL could save a fortune by getting rid of coaches and picking from the reddit comment pool,5
Shikhar has more runs in ipl than rohit sharma. Didn't expected that tbh.,5
In hindsight should have sent Hetmyer at 3,2
Iyer trying to get bat to ball,1
Iyer needs to get a move on. Delhi have plenty of batting left,5
Woah Rohit Sharma 3 to 5 in one season!! Pretty fitting though. Warner & Dhawan have been IPL legends past 5-6 years,0
Bhenchod accelerate now,3
"damn it MI fans, why you cheering on DC, it's so unfair :(",4
I remember when Iyer used to hit sixes down the ground and walk nonchalantly towards his partner without even looking at the ball.. Where is that iyer,10
Good boy Iyer. Chasing off the flies.,3
Rahane would have been better than iyer.,7
tuk tuk iyer ruining the run rate.,6
Iyer needs to belt bob,4
Someone remind Iyer that this is a knock out match please,4
Iyer playing a disasterclass of an innings.,6
"Is it that people hate MI or that they just don't want them to win so much? Because I want a new winner as well, but I don't hate them, they're lovely to watch while playing and great blokes.",3
Why do I sense a slow down coming,2
"Said it many times, Iyer is a bang average batsman in T20s.",3
Should have sent Hetmyer,1
"This was SRH's strong zone and Delhi came out dominant. If only SRH's batting was decent enough, this would have been a contest. Right now, its more like a replay of QF1.",1
Garg please don't bump into the other guy. Go a little behind unless you're close to the boundary.,3
Tactical drop,2
Shreyas '20 runs short's Iyer,0
"1 boundary in the last 3 overs. smh.

Go big or get out you have 9 wickets and 6 overs to go.",2
SRH don't have the batting power for this,1
Thanks Iyer. Every ball you face is lifting my spirits.,3
What an effort,2
Iyer 12th man of SRH,1
Cant even pick a ball. 88 was his peak and Iyer is done should just get out now and let Hety come or Axar. Just building pressure on  Dhawan.,1
warner looks adorable next to holder.,8
Even Rahane could've played at this pace.,3
Just not our day,2
Dancing Iyer from NZ returns,3
"Dammit, wish that catch got taken",1
Good tactical drop by Kane .,7
Selfish piece of garbage Iyer,5
KANOS THE WARRIOR AND KANOS THE BARRIER,2
Brilliant match awareness from Williamson to drop that catch. What a smart cricketer,18
Good riddance,2
"Form batting lineup of top 7 of Indian team should be:

Dhawan

Mayank

Rahul

Surya

Kishan

Pandya

Axar",4
for DC’s sake that should’ve been caught,4
Iyer undoing all the work done in opening,9
Tuk tuk train stops now,3
"Dhoni/KL ""CERTIFIED RUN RATE"" innings from Iyer.",4
Same story everytime for Iyer,3
Not a good inning from Iyer,2
"If we take out Iyer's matches at Sharjah this season, his strike rate is less than 110. So shit.",8
Feels so good to watch a game when you are not supporting any team.,3
Shreyas “The Accelerator” Iyer,6
"Lol, Iyer. Hilarious. Nice waste of balls.",7
Wish I had a beard as magnificent as Kane,3
Ok now you're allowed to shit on ieyr,8
Proper dogshit innings,7
that would've been catch of the season,7
Thank god,1
"Iyer cant handle another 100 run loss to MI, he knows what he's doing.",1
21(19). Alright better than the predicted 16(21),3
Thank god,3
Imagine Iyer as our no 4 for India in world t20......,3
Wrong wicket SrH. Smh,5
Okay..... 21(20) is crap when openers gave such a start,6
Send Hetmayer plx.,1
"*Iyer gets out*


Happy DC noises",3
He really wanted to get out,3
SKY better than iyer. Change my mind.,9
So glad,2
Shreyas Momentum Killing Iyer,3
Dude shuffed to off side and then to leg side just to almost get destroyed by Kanos' brilliance,4
This is the worst innings I have seen in a while!,4
Shreyas supports Make in India,3
Probably a blessing for dc tbh,5
Yaar. Iyer hit or get out and let the hitters come in.,3
Thank you Iyer for this useless innings.. Rahane would have been better.. hopefully Pant comes now and smashes some..,3
" SRH had retained who all before 2018 auctions ? Warner/Bhuvi/Rashid? 

And who did they get through RTM?",7
"Wtf , why would you take his catch god dammit",9
Lol,3
Put SKY over Iyer,0
This is just stupid.,2
shreyas iyer single handedly dragging SRH back into the match.,3
Match losing innings,5
"send in Axar, then pant then hety",2
Stoinis and Dhawan is really where our batting starts and ends. Fuck fuck Iyer,4
Nice tuk tuk Iyer is out,0
"No. I want Iyer. I am staging a protest now. Fellow SRHers, please join me.",2
"Despite the wicket, nothing has gone our way so far. That catch would’ve been an absolute worldie",3
Kanos know all timelines,3
Thanks Iyer :),2
This innings will cost Delhi,2
"Gotta say, That was a great pullback from after 10th over",2
feels like Jason holder only puts 50% effort in bowling but still bowls 130Kmph. What an absolute behemoth,2
Oh no!,1
Ricky ponting never looks satisfied lmao,3
THANK FUCK THEY SENT HETMYER,4
Omg Kane what was that!?,3
[deleted],-3
Imagine if they send Rahane in next,3
"Iyer Dikh raha hai.  
Haa uska wicket le liya.  
Nhi lena tha",2
"Shreyas aaya

Shreyas gaya",3
Serious question to experts here- What exactly is going wrong with Shreyas :(,1
"Shreyas really came there to score a run a ball and get out, even Rahane could've done that.",2
Wtf was Iyer doing.... He seems good for the ODIs but seems to lack that aggression for the T20s.... And to say he will be India's no. 4 in T20Is is just oit of this world... Single handedly killed the momentum of this whole innings....,5
tactical wicket by DC. Punter is the master strategist.,3
A poor ODI innings from Iyer comes to an end. Not a 'big' wicket like commentators are making it to be.,1
Iyer being out is a blessing for delhi,3
Iyer fucked the momentum as usual.,2
now we need Shikhar's wicket ASAP and we can maybe make it a manageable chase,5
"What a terrible innings by Iyer.  
He's a shitty batsman and a shittier captain.  
  
21(20) and sapped the momentum completely",2
Iyer in t20 team cuz he posted a happy birthday message for Koach /s,2
Brilliant effort from Williamson,1
"Any innings below a 160 SR is a test innings for you guys, isn't it?",3
Iyer is a fkin liability,3
Wow no wonder he thinks himself as next VK,3
Lol.,1
Captain's knock,3
"Guys, are those SRH chicks regular fans or families of the SRH sponsors? Are regular people allowed in th stadiums now or not?",2
Just what SRH would have wanted. Iyer wasting three overs at run a ball.,2
[removed],7
Lmao dc has no trust in pant so they,1
" Shreyas Iyer averages 9.5 runs in his first 10 balls faced, this season. The only batsmen (min 10 innings) to start slower than him are Virat Kohli, MS Dhoni, Shane Watson, and Rishabh Pant  -CricViz",7
"**13.6** Holder to Iyer, OUT,  **126-2**

SS Iyer c Pandey b Holder 21 (20b 1x4 0x6) SR: 105.00",2
Big booty Hetmyer here,2
Yeah ofcourse he won't get the timing if he keeps moving in the crease like a retard. He has almost no time to play the ball.,0
Any words Iyer supporters regarding his exciting innings today?,4
thank God,1
Send Hetmeyer - dont worry about left right,1
Manish should have dropped it tbh.,1
Iyer getting out is really bad for SRH,1
"Perfect innings by Iyer for SRH, really stepped up when the team needed him the most",3
"yay 21(19) amazing from the captain.  
glad he is out, please dont send in Rahane FFS",2
Fuck we needed iyer,3
A momentum killing innings,2
question on everyone's mind : will DC choke?,4
Damnnn this boy thicccc,3
Now Hetmyer is in danger agains Rashid!,2
Iver's dismissal might be a blessing in disguise for DC,3
Big Butt comments in 3...2...1,1
Who knew people would be disappointed seeing pant come out this season that's 2020 for you,1
Hey idiots how many balls Iyer need more to settle down? Fucking clown fans.,1
Let me taste that a.....,2
Iyer sucked this ipl.,3
Was a good strategic drop by Kanos but PandeyG wasn't in on the plan.,4
Kane dropped it for a reason. Take a hint Manish...,3
" T20 is not for Shreyas iyer

There's no question about it I've been saying it since he got selected in Indian team for T20I If you're taking singles and blocking in 18th over with 8 wickets to go no you're not good.

He couldn't even face Bangladesh's bowlers Blocking them like it was Glenn McGrath on the other side.

Yeah you get one or two or good innings in which you manage to get your SR above 128 but that's it.

ye Shaw aur Iyer se acha sky ko hi Australia tour pe le jaye,1
Shreyas doesn't deserve a spot in the Indian team at the moment tbh.,4
He packing as well,1
Hoping Kohli is not blamed for this demotion of Pant from no 4 .,0
Iyer successfully saved holders figures,2
Manish anna should've pulled a 3D babu and dropped Iyer. This will be a disaster.,1
Oof. Should have dropped that. Iyer sucks. Now Axar is gonna come in and smash.,4
"That’s good. That’s how you are supposed to build pressure. Make them feel the desperation to continue on that great start. When they start scoring below their current run-rate, they’ll think they are slowing the team down.",2
Iyer also put pressure on Dhawan. He also mellowed in the middle.,2
Iyer's accumulation might make sense if Pant were still the maverick he was a couple of years back.,4
How are the likes of holder and archer able to generate so much pace from such a short run up?,2
What's the debate about in dugout?,3
New injury for srh huh,5

Wow what was garg doing,3
"Under Kohli every batsman in the T20/ODI team is getting ""Iyer-ized"" 
  
KL Rahul's ""s/r is overrated"" and Pant's decline should be seen through this prism. As should, Kohli's own slow batting.",7
Anothuh one. Fuck us,3
Oh god Garg you ok?,2
Oh shit here come the horny people,5
I don't want to say but that was ... stupid.:(,4

"Fuck that didn't look good

This outfield looks very slippery

Not particularly great for tough outfielding",3
Wow another injury really.,3
ouch priyam,2
Wtf is happening,4
One more goes down,3
Lmao Rahane died for this. Not that he would've done exceptionally better but even he could've scored 21 odd runs at this strike rate.,3
Painful awkward looking one,2
"Great, let's just pull out of the tournament smh.",1
Holy fuck that looked bad,4
Oooof that must hurt,1
"Iyer played 21(20). Rahane would have played a similar innings, what's the point lmao",4

The overstepping by a spinner is criminal. I can't believe its a normal thing but he does it fucking regularly",1
Stop the count ffs,9
Lol holder just tied hetmeyers laces what a lad,3
There is no excuse for a spinner bowling a noball.,4
60 runs in 5 overs is not out of ordinary tbh. 200 is still on.,4

Any update on Garg?,2
Lol a Tamil commentator called out how these Altroz ads are putting people in debt by buying cars they don’t need .,12
100 of 10 and 144 of 16 wow just wow,5
SRH should just concede the match on account of the plumpest posterior of either teams that's currently in the middle,5

That TCL ad sounds like ezios family tune from AC 2,1
SRH : STOP THE INJURIES.,3
Please restrict them to 180,1
Brilliant batting against Rashid from DC. He has been exceptional against us,5
If someone gets out send Pant then Axar. Rahane will the specialist fielder today.,5

Need a special Big Dick innings  from Daddy Warner tonight💦,8
Come on Nattu gimme those yorkers,3
"In India we tend to salivate over technical correctness and fortitude in the ODI/T20 team (not in the Test team for some reason, where Pujara used to be questioned about his intent regularly by Koach and Bewda before the Aus series)  
  
The truth is that ""technique"" in LOI is overrated now. Find a way to score runs and score quickly. England have found a way to do it with batsmen who dont have classical techniques in ODIs( Morgan is an example) and WI have found a way to do that in T20.  
  
The longer we persist with slow s/r batsmen like Iyer in the team. The worse its gonna be. They will lose us a game in the WT20 like Rahane did with his 40(35) in the SF",7
Natarajan looking like a filthy hippy,0
What is highest score chased by SRH,1
Srh have so many man of the matches. Warner hasn't had one yet. Game isn't over bois.,2
Set 200 as the benchmark.,1

Does anyone not get along with Dhawan?,5
Ok now I think DC will make atleast 200! Maybe even 220! I changed my prediction score😬,1
 STOP THE COUNT!,5
Our Bois should've picked Abhishek. I mean that dude can at least bat,5
"Halfway through the tournament I thought Rohit-KL-Virat-Iyer was going to be our T20 WC batting order for sure, but now I'm not so certain. Dhawan finding great form and KL going too slow to play at 4 changes a lot",4
Warner and Williamson will chase anything under 200 imo,4
Please Hetmyer 3 sixes now.,2
"I know I am no cricket connoisseur nor I have an Oxford PhD in cricket but I think I have found the reason behind our boring batting lineup who cant hit out even if they want to do it. 



Until 5-6 years ago, Indian fans, experts and media did all kinds of comparisons. We always said Rahane and Pujara are Dravid/Laxman 2.0 or  kohli is Tendulkar 2.0 Pandya is Kapilpaji 2.0 and things like that.




But we never forced them to be their clones. There were comparisons and metaphors but no forced adoption of their gameplay and strategies. 



And what's happening nowadays? We literally want every right handed Batsman to be a Kohli clone, every left handed to be a Yuvi clone and every WK to be a Dhoni clone. 


A right handed batsman is shitty unless he doesnt runs 3s, averages 52 and plays ""safe"" cricket; Just like Kohli does. 


A wicketkeeper is called shitty unless he keeps like Thala, breathes like Thala talks or sleeps like Thala. 



For God's sake let the Iyers, Samsons, Pants and Kishans bat like madmen who hit 3 sixes every over and dont waste their time and energy in stealing doubles.",17
Incoming juicy full tosses from Nattu.,6

DC should declare their innings right now.,4
Who's the Sheikh?,2
Oh the opening speech boi is here,5
Jay Shah looks like the guy who sits with a calculator at posh sweet shops,16
Good to see that Sheikh seemingly not a hostage any longer,6

"That sheikh has ZERO clue about what's going on, doesn't he?",18
"This match is basically Warner or bust now. Goswami is a walking wicket, Garg is probably not batting, Samad isn't reliable.",10
I think Dc is going to losse against MI for another time or MI gonna take revenge against SRH for their last loose against them,2
Ok I am feeling delhi is doing an mi like finish today,3
This ipl 2020 successful run will definitely be a case study in many international business schools .,3
Terrible over rate from SRH. 9PM and still 3.3 overs remaining.,8
Hope nattu becomes lord nattu next season,3
I am gonna fail NNN looking at this thicc boi,9
"You're being listened to whether you want it or not. Is that unsettling, or reassuring?",17

Hetmyer is fitter than Pant,11

"*The number 69 appears on the screen*

Actual grown men on Reddit (even in 2020) - ""Noice"".",8
Nattu can be cute if he starts grooming,15
Well...usually it’s the bowlers doing good and the batsman playing trash to get a loss. This time the bowlers did badly and time for the batsman to step up,6
I will forever be confused between Abdul Samad's and Abhishek Sharma's face,8
This shall test srhs true batting potential today,6
"if saha was in today, i wouldn't have been worried about SRH's ability to chase this...",13
MI is like thanos but we're living in that one possibility where Iron man (CSK) didn't survive.,11
Need minimum 35 in last 3.,6
Dhawan need to sacrifice his wicket now,2
"Delhi doing all this to do a 30/4 kind of score with MI in final, & getting thrashed eventually.",5
I know its No Shave November but someone shave that horrible beard.,10
Wtf was that dhawan,5
Dc on fire,3
200 looks unlikely now,8
"Below 200, and I will be disappointed with DC. They still have 8 wickets in hand, ffs.",5
Another snooze-fest innings by Dhawan today. This is not a test match old man! Your SR should > 250,-5
"Warner Should score a 100 today..
Match might get interesting then",4
Natarajan delivering under extreme pressure . Gotto give credit .,4
Y'all talking about Natarajans beard but that's where he gets his power,5
Phonepe bc how much longer are you gonna hide who Shalu is? Its pathetic marketing if there's no shalu.,8
No nattu november failed,9
200? 🥺,3
Natrajan just shave that beard man. Why.,6
Does Dhawan only have one shot at the death? Seems like he keeps trying for that sweep.,8
Happily surprised to see one of Indian LOI Top3 - Dhawan performing in knockout game! Hope Rohit too does well in finals on Tuesday.,8
"I get why the yorker is difficult to bowl right, but why is it taxing on your body?",3
"200 is still on table

3 overs and 40 runs

very doable

if lucky they can still get it 210",3
"21(20) he really stalled the innings there.
When stoinis got out score was 85 in 8 overs 
When iyer got out it was 126/2 in 14 overs.",5
Ok West Indian power,1
We need 11cr Pandey to play an innings worth 11cr and not a tuk tuk one,5
"Look folks, Natarajan has been quite a revelation, but he must change his Amish beard (unless of course, it is a religious thing).",13
Big booty hetty come on,3

Hetty looking pretty,1
I'm 18 and I've a better beard than nattu.. ugh,-1
Why is iyer so bad now?,2
Hetty to score a quickfire 50?,1
What do these people eat??,1
Well hit Hetmyer.,1
No Shrivats as opener today. Let Warner open with Samad.,2
google commentary : Rashid is done,2
Every boundary gives me life,3
If one of them gets out Axar should come in.,2
200 is on guys,4
What that was 4 lmao,5
Nadeem can’t do anything right..,8
Fuckin Madagascar,3
Nadeems having a shocker. Feel bad for him,6
More catches dropped smh,6
Feeling bad for Nadeem,6
Guys guys you can visit more than 190 countries by attending Dubai Expo :),12
Nadeem having a tough day,6
"It's so great to see somebody relying on yorkers. Bhuvi, Bumrah used to do that in the past, but now it's like they want to prove they are skillful and don't just rely on one ball.",7
Can SRH Chase 200?,1
Nadeem having a really bad day today,3
Nadeem isn't having a good day,2
"Srh fans when they are clearly winning the game: Haha well played guys, we're shitting the bed.  Srh fans when they are clearly losing the game: Warner is still there we aren't out of the game yet.",2

Chutiya nadeem,1
bhai ghooma aise mujhe to laga pakad liya,1
"Look at Nadeem man, felt like conceding 50 so let that boundary past too",4
Lmao,1
"If DC manages to lose this, watch out Iyer",3
Nadeem looking kinda sus,4
I think the only reason to send out iyer instead of hetmyer was to play out rashid,5
Warners gonna hit nadeem today,3
"Gotta say ........ I thought for sure DC was gonna get to 225+ with that insane start.

What a shit job of closing a match so far. You guys have 8 wickets on hand ......... the fuck are you doing brotatos?

Shit or get off the pot.",1
"Nadeem is having such a shitty day on field...


May be he should try luck opening",2
Bruh I was sure that was a catch,1
I would have actually sent pant one down today and would have told him and go demolish the game. Given him the full freedom to hit out.,1
Today srh is not picking wickets they should pick,1
"B Lara ""they would love to see the back of Hetmyer""
The thicc back",2
Can Warner replicate Gilchrist's blinder today? Seems like the only way srh wins from here,5
Whoever said Nadeem is a match fixer might be on to something,8
SRH having a bad day today,4
Not a good day for Nadeem,3
Hit-myer,3
Shit show continues. End this misery already,1
Nadeem has had a stinker of the highest level today. Abhishek could've been a better option.,4
itna bhi choke mat karo pls,3
It's gonna be Warner vs DC in the 2nd innings.,3
nadeem confirmed fix,4
Bruh that looks as if nadeem did it purposefully...,7
Nadeem wants to go back to Delhi Capitals i guess.,5
Nadeem having an absolute shocker,3
Dhawan 21\*(20) since his half century,6
[deleted],-10
No way hetmeyer's gonna get selected for WI test team,6
an extra roll would make up for shit fielding,3
DC score is gonna read 0/2 against MI in the finals. Mark my words.,8
Someone like Hetmyer never plays check drives. More break of the wrist,2
Pls stop this nonsense of giving ex-players a fucking preference for the commentators job. Murali Karthik and SG are a giant pain the neck.,6
"Now don't dance Dhawan, stay in the crease and hit it hard.",6
3 of the top 4 super strikers are MI players. How is this even fair.,13
How can everyone shit at fielding at once?,7
Think this match srh would have preferred Bairstow over kanos,5
"Where was he all this time?

Ricky Ponting, you’ve blood on your hands.",16
"As a DC fan:

&#x200B;

I love Jason holder, so field properly off his bowling!!",4

"DC transferred the Shaw energy to SRH by dropping him, Nadeem the unfortunate victim",5
"SRH is more like a 145 - 160 (at best) chasing team.

Every run from here on is 1 run too much for SRH to chase.

Only a blinder from Warner can turn it around. Else this team's natural capability is 160 to 165 at the most (especially with Bairstow also not part of 11).",8
Nadeem might as well sit it out now.,1
I guess Dhawan confused orange for yellow and started blasting,7
Rashid 4-0-26-1 after giving 11 runs in the first over,3
DC in terminator mode,5

MI must be salivating now looking at the cup!",2
Mi amore,1
How did Nadeem play the rest of the season or has he been always this bad,2
Yeah bowl full tosses,8
Never saw Warner let down like this.,2
we've been so shit today. wtf is happening?,3
Shreyas’s innings looks even worse now... especially if they lose and he ends up saying they were 20 short,8
"WI have an amazing middle-lower order for the upcoming T20 World Cup. Hetmyer, Pooran, Holder, Pollard, Russell, Bravo, Allen from 3 to 9.",4
This is what I said in the last SRH match.. no one was attacking Holder.. once you attack him his line and length takes a beating..,4
"3 dudes from MI in Altroz super charged Striker, highest strike rates in overs 16-20",3
Iyer needs to take notes instead of clapping ffs,6
Warner's psycho smile,3
"If the required rate is going to be above 10, SRH can bid adieu",4
"Hety boy has scored 8 more runs than ""Kohli's pet poodle"" Iyer and faced 7 balls less.  
  
Afford dudes like him the luxury of getting set and going bang rather than 21(20)s like Iyer",5

Jason holder being targeted totally today . Punter prolly said guys we can’t take it slow against anyone other than rashid .,9
One sided match again.,2
Dhawan in UAE is Sheikher hehehehehe,16
"Gg srh, too much to chase alr.",7
Dhawan is only T20 player in world who scores at 160 Strike rate by batting like ODIs. Haters eat your heart out. 😭😂😭😂,15
Holder anna don't score 50nwhile bowling,4
Bruh now I'm legit concerned. These guys are gonna take our third pacer and one of Krunal/Chahar apart,11
Please let Dhawan score a century,3
Century possible for Dhawan?,5
Get warner first over and the match is in the bag,4
"Imagine having hitters like Heytmyer and Pooran in your middle order.



As an Indian I am so jealous.",10
Whatever has to go wrong went wrong today.,7
"Hetti, luv ya",3
Iyer cheering like a clueless idiot,6
At least now Pant will come in with the license to play his natural game,2
Should be a six.,3
That's a six for sure.,1
srh body language is totally dejected,2
"Never expected Delhi to stop Pant, during a high scoring match",1
Holder gets half century 🙏,3
We were bound to have a shocker at some point,2

"Last match Jason holder was an economical bowler, today he's been taken for more than a half century.",2
Holder with half century,3
Big booty hetty's miss hit goes for a boundary,4
It’s so satisfying seeing hitable bowlers getting hit.,8
"Anyone else getting tired of Warner's ""Fk my life"" smile?",8
Warner has gone insane or knows something no one else does,1
Just tuned it . WHA HAPPENED?!,5
This shot reminded me of OG Pant :(,10
Thats a 4...,6
Ponting: I see your Iyer and raise you my Hetmyer,10
That's a 4,6
"GG Delhi, Sunrisers returning to 2008 Deccan Chargers",9
52 runs in four overs and a costly drop. Smh.,9
If Hetmyer would have come in at 3 at least there would have been an extra 10 runs for DC.,7
I'm sorry but SRH aren't chasing anything higher than 170+. You done good so far SRH but it's most likely the end of the road for you..,20
Ok i retract the dinda academy Award from nadeem to holder,0
Disaster class,4
Pls not another one sided play off match pls :'(,2
"If it wasn't for Iyer, we were looking at 200+",15
This is too much for SRH to chase in any given situation. And this is the semi-final ffs. No way the team is chasing this down.,8
you can smack Nadeem about but leave my boy Jase alone,4
👌,5
It might go well over 200 now.,8
"Holder living up to his reputation, 50 in 4 overs.",5
Bold Prediction: Samad plays a great lone hand tonight but is unable to take the team home.,8
Iyer needs to learn from Hetmyer how to carry on the momentum..,3
200 incoming,3
Bruh they take the absolute piss out of everything in the Dugout. 😂,4
[deleted],3
The problem today with Iyer was not his intent but his execution. Bad move still sending himself over Hetmyer,3
Holder completes his fifty. Yaaay!,3
Holder with the half century,5
"we'll need Davey, Kanos and Pandey ji in top form today and hope Goswami, Priyam and Samad aren't useless.",2
Damn Holder half century today but but w the ball,3
"Nadeem missed out, Holder didn't.",1
Hetmyer is a proper player,4
Hetmeyer is such a clean striker. Insane talent that DC hasn’t made full use of.,2
Never thought we’d hit Holder for a half century. Bringing Stoin and Hetmyer up was a great decision.,2
Exactly how RCB should have batted against SRH.,3
Is the pitch batting friendly or our bowlers suddenly turned to ultra shite,3
50 holder 🎉🎉,4
"I have one question for you guys

Bowlers like bumrah or rashid ..when they are playing for ipl (franchise cricket) don't players in the team (foreign players ) get used to their bowling in the nets.
Like for example rashid khan would ball to kane , warner would they feel comfortable when playing him in int cricket?",5
There is no way SRH winning unless someone plays a freak innings like Gilly's onslaught against DD in 2009.,5
Alexa play coffin dance,7
MI vs DC in finals unless a Warner special,6
Getting Iyer out was a huge mistake.,8
congrats to DC for qualifying to the finals *angry Warner noises*,3
RCB got 132 against this lineup with Kohli and AB in their ranks,3
"Only thing good for SRH rn is the prevalence of dew.  
They have to hold the barrier of 200 and if Warner fires...they have a chance",5
What even,3
Lmao,1
I can't believe Bairstow got dropped for this shit,1
OMG RASHID,1
LOL RASHID,2
A half century of pain for Holder.,5
Warner and Kanes wickets and GG boys... go early to hotel and prepare well for tuesday,1
WTF People abusing Nadeem and calling him a fixer. He wouldnt get half the hate if not for his religion,-1
wtf is going on,3
Honestly what the fuck are we doing?,2
Thanks Rashid.,2
What the fuck haha,1
Oh fuck off,1
Ya know how Warner hasn't got a man of the match in this tournament yet? Today would be a really good day to get it.,3
Excellent game for Warner to repeat Qualifier 2 2016,2
Oh come on Rashid!!!,4
Seriously unbelievable,4
No one wants to catch a catch today..,3
"holy shit, I’m changing my flair. This has to be the worst fielding and bowling I’ve seen in a while, especially for a Q2 game",5
SRH day is off,3
Nice scriptwriting!,7
Wtf Rashid,6
How tf did he drop that!?,5
"Another drop, WTF. Catch one for fucks sake.",10
This is too fucking comical,7
Lmao wtf is happening,5
Dude !! WTF is wrong with SRH ??,6
Ohh boyy.. Srh is truly fking this up,5
Oh no Rashid,4
Ffs rashid,4
Beautiful drop Rashid. Who are you going to give the angry eyes to?,9
Fuck yeah boi,2
Yikes at SRH fielding,3
Are you fucking kidding me,5
Fixed bc,1
What the fuck is this fielding performance,4
SRH dropping catches😳,2
If you gotta get dhawan out then you have to get him out early with a jaffa like Bumrah in the previous match or Cummins in the kkr match.,2
Lol finally this wiped that smile of Warner’s face,6
"He’d been in decline for some time, but feels like SG’s commentary has fallen off a cliff this time. Odd mix of crank and anachronism.",1
Even Rashid dropping catches! Shows the pressure on them,5
Warner has that dead inside look lmao,6
Bayliss about to explode,3
"Under pressure SRH, totally under pressure",3
Ok srh just take the plane back home you don't want to win,2
Ponting needs to smack tf out of Iyer for playing so shit today,2
"Arrey bhosdike, aur kitne misfields",3
srh doesn't want to win,3
Wow..,2
Warner finally stopped smiling,5
David’s death scare should rattle everyone.,1
Crocodile hands.,1
"Hope delhi are able to beat mumbai next game , dont want those fuckers to win another season",6
What did Ponting feed the team? Except for Iyerland of course.,5
SRH should just forfeit the match at this point.,4
This is not ok,2
Literally falling apart,1
what the fuck,1
Fixed op,2
"On a separate note, I am so looking forward to the return of international cricket.. I don't think **I've watched** Windies play in New Zealand in life on this planet.",3
Lol Rashid garu match fixing in the open.,2
Lol,1
Now Warner not smiling,4
Lmao,1
dhawan definitely made some deal with the devil,2
Srh fielders refuse to catch anything.,1
That's a sitter.,2
Everything is just going wrong not one good thing.,1
..... I'm out of words,1
SRH can't take even sitters under pressure and they were thinking of winning against the might MI? I don't think so.,2
Is this a revenge game for DC? Feels just like the league match against DC but with everything opposite.,2
"TOLD YOU RASHID SUCKED AS A FIELDER.  
  
TOLD YOU. WHERE ARE THOSE DUDES WHO WERE MOUTHING ME OFF NOW?",6
Lmfao these guys don't wanna win,3
This is jaw droppingly shocking,4
Oh man this is so not our day.,2
SRH imploding,2
I am just hoping for a miracle from Warner. And dew. Lots of dew,2
Seriously wtf!!,1
All according to keikaku,1
"Rashid is the impostor, overthrows, dropped catches!!",1
How the fuck does Dhawan get away with shit dropped catches like this,1
Warner is slooowly dying inside,3
Warner about to cut a bitch.,3
We don't deserve to win this match guys. We played like shit,6
Rigged,3
Rashid dropped one against RCB too right,4
"This is not SRH's day, nothing is going in their way",1
"There's no way we'll even chase 160.   
Delhi into finals ----> Congrats MI for the 5th trophy. Insane",4
Fixed crowd goes brrrrrrr,10
You just dropped the chance to lose to MI in finals Rashid 😱,7
Find the boundary else the 200 is unreachable,1
[removed],0
This is ICC Dhawan. Even the lord cant taken him down,2
I'm prepared for a Warner 0(1),6
"Ok fixing confirmed ..../s

Dropping 2 sitters in 2 matches",5
"Every Dhawan century has its share if forture, that is for sure.",2
**Insert disappointed Pakistani fan meme**,3
I want to report a bruh moment.,1
Ayo wtf,2
FieldsBadMan,2
"After this horrible performance today, we don't deserve to go through at all.",3
Warner's face says it all,3
SRH have screwed SRH.,2
"Why does IPL have such terrible cameras for a rich tournament? You can even sponsor it if needed, Lenskart ultra view",3
How many has Rashid dropped this season?,2
All right this is too much now lol. Warner is gonna go ballistic today and chase this shit single-handedly.,4
SRH playing to lose today it seems,3
Rashid's been acting sus since last few games ngl,4
Thank fuck,3
He'll still get him this over,4
WTF IS GOING ON WITH THE FIELDING,4
"Pressure, pressure",5
The way Srh is having a bad day I must say these are  curse from RCBIANS.,5
W00t!,3
We don’t deserve the match anyway terrible fielding,2
Reverse and out name a better story,3
Finally sandeep has to do for himself.,2
Pant masterclass in 9 balls?,2
Weirdest lbw I've ever seen,3
SRHs wheels are coming apart ... they know backs are against the walls here,2
[deleted],2
Revised total 185,6
Momentum is a curse. Ask the UK Labour Party. Ask SRH,2
Finally lmao,5
Motabhai wants DC in final so he made a few calls...,7
Finally they got him,5
We looked like the best fielding side in last few games and it all went south in this game.,8
"Sandeep: Fine, I'll do it myself.",4
"Only warner 100 can save srh...
Anything less than that, ATB  dc against ipl giants",2
Wtf Williamson's amazing save in dropped catches?,8
"We batted v well today, barring Iyer's stunting game",3
He gave himself out. Well batted.,5
"SRH shat all too much. Pressure does stuff Yes, but God are they too bad this match.",5
Dhawan and reverse sweeping whyyyy,3
Shikhar played good....so duck nxt game?,6
Ok dhawan very cool,1
Thank goodness,1
"Lmao what a way to get out. Such an anticlimax  



Well played Gabbar. Would've liked maybe 10 more runs from him in the same amount of balls but 78 is okay too.",4
"What's the other name for a NoSQL database?

JSON Holder",50
Pant please for the love of all of us. Go fuck the balls outta the park,5
Gabbar first man in history to have walked for an LBW,9
Fucking keeper is not even appealing. Idiot sala,5
tactical wicket ™®,5
Come on dhawan.. you can't play a reverse sweep against a spinner and you wanna do it against a pacer.. do better.,1
Only Lord Kanos can save SRH now along with Warner,2
David Warner facial expression made me burst out in laughter,2
"Apart from the Kanos's drop catch, all the other were pretty much straightforward catches",3
"Bowling in the slot, batsman hitting it straight to the fielder and the fielder dropping it.

Or as Bill Lawry would say: Great cricket all around.",2
Sundowners Hyderabad,0
Sandeep the magician,2
Does that hit outside line lol?,4
Dhawan needs to stop thinking he can reverse sweep,3
*Sigh* Dhawan gets tired and plays a reverse to get out,7
"Oh Laudey!  Dropped catch...

T: Oh cock! Dropped catch...",1
Great innings from big match Dhawan,3
Outside off impact. Not out that's,2
Lmao what the fuck is going on?,2
Pant?,1
Is Rasheed high ffs? How did he drop that?,3
Why not review bc,3
How was that out ?,3
How was that 3x,1
Great innings by Dhawan....wish he could have gotten his 100,2
If SRH win this will Saha be available for the finals?,3
Name a better duo than dhawan and getting out on reverse shots,4
Lol Shikhar had to get out trying to play reverse sweep again.,4
Wtf he didn't review it?,5
"Dhawan you did your job, a big thigh slap for you",3
Atleast happy dhawan no century,0
"2 thoughts:

1) SRH's fielding has been awful

2) Dhawan needs to put that reverse sweep away - pretty sure he was outside the line there though",9
"Dhawan and getting out trying a reverse sweep, what's a more iconic combo",7
Axar or pant next ?,1
poo that looked not out,2
"SD going for it , right attitude imo",3
The sweep gets Dhawan again,1
Bruh I genuinely think there's a chance that this is rigged,5
I feel Murali Karthik and SG’s job is basically to shit on the player.,3
Impact outside off?,3
Why would you walk for that?!,3
Damn that looked impact outside to me,1
"Hit outside off, I think. But Dhawan walked off.",3
The script has been top-notch this IPL! Wonder what the writers have got in store for us in the final.,2
Dhawan really wanted to get out,6
"The way Hetmyer and Stoinis is playing I thought this year RCB had 2 issues and

1.Needed one opener who can just go and smash and help DDP.

2.A middle order batsman who can just go and smash and help ABD.

Why RCB why  :(",7
Some dude during the powerplay said Dhawan will get out trying to play a reserve shot and he did,2
Sandeep's done better than any other bowler today. Should've had 3 wickets and the game would've been totally flipped on its head.,2
Pant redemption time?,1
That's outside the line,1
How did he not review that !!,2
G fking g Dhawan,1
"Doesn’t fucking matter, we ain’t chasing this",0
DC: Oh no! Anyway...,2
YRFKA deliberately dropped it to screw sandy,3
Why does Dhawan play the reverse sweep everytime he's set even though he gets dismissed like literally everytime playing it!!!,1
4 dropped catches. Multiple balls slipping through fingers for boundaries. Spinners bowling no balls. Must be worst fielding session for SRH ever.,3
He's probably tired. Otherwise why wouldn't you review that?,6
that wicket is a little late in the game,1
Shikar was just tired and wanted to head back,2
"A clutch innings from Dhawan... DC well on course to win this game unless Warner, Williamson and Holder have other ideas with the bat.",0
Bro where’s AXAR,1
""" Pettiton to exchange Pant in Place of Hetmyer ✍️""- DDCA corrupt Chairman.",2
Wasn’t that outside the line?,1
Perfect time for pant to come on. He will just be interested to smash the balls,2
Review?,2
Maybe dhawan wanted to go and give a chance for pant to hit a quick 5 ball 18,3
If you need momentum then just get Rahkeem Cornwall in your side since momentum is directly proportional to mass,2
Why did he walk away?,2
"Pant has the license here, needs to go big",1
Bruh this is a lump dick ending to an amazing start. Mumbai will torch us for a 4th time,4
"**18.3** Sandeep Sharma to Dhawan, OUT, Dhawan looks for the revere sweep, but Sandeep beats him with a quick full toss and he has been given out lbw. It seems he has been hit outside the line but he doesn't bother reviewing **178-3**

S Dhawan lbw b Sandeep Sharma 78 (50b 6x4 2x6) SR: 156.00",1
"The pitch has slowed a bit, hoping it'll only get slower",1
Should've reviewed imo,2
I think Dhawan knows he can't play the reverse sweep so always plays it when he wants to get out,3
So plumb that Dhawan walked before Reiffel could lift his finger,1
Dhawan didn't get a 100. Moral victory ✌️,2
Aim for below 200. Shift the momentum.,5
Ok pant show me the thicc power like hetymer,3
Maybe Shikka was tired,2
Srh is letting them score so that warner can score a century and take orange cap.,2
How does Sandeep Sharma get top class batsmen out using a full toss,3
Let's zoooo,2
210,2
"Would've been umpire's call, I reckon",1
"MI wanted Delhi in the final.  


So, Jio made a few connections",4
Impact outside off?,3
"SRH need Bairstow for this chase, he's their most destructive player along with Warner, Kane is not ideal for 170+ chases.",2
The two thicc bois,4
Shkar ethical. Delhi gonna win the cup confirmed.,4
2 big asses at the crease...,3
A special shout out to David Warner who is keeping his calm amid all this nonsense bowling and fielding.,3
"Not out 😂

Kohli's infamous walk against Pak in the 2019 WC",6
Dhawan always gets tired and starts doing cute shit that his rigid body can’t pull off,4
"Normally I love you Pant, but please shit the bed rn. Thanks",1
need 2 boundaries on last 2 balls,1
If SRH lose this match it would be because this ATROCIOUS fielding.,3
THICC Boys in the middle.,4
"Idk if anyone has mentioned it yet, but running between the wickets this innings has been fire",0
2 thicccies batting,3
That is a pathetic decision.,2
"Dude how good has sandeep been , i expect him to get smacked every game in death overs and he doesnt 

I know people keep saying that he's underrated but ... He's srsly underrated",10
Dhawan must have Rashid's original birth certificate.,16
"Dhawan gets out playing reverse sweep 2-3 times this ipl.

Le Dhawan : I'll do it again. (Good innings tho.)",8
Lmao Dhawan,5
LMAO,3
"Review that, so outside",2
"Baby you're my CVV 

I am your OTP

When we come together

The payment is easy

Download cred baby

Download cred baby

Download cred baby

Download cred baby

Download cred-",9
Less go Pant,2
No doubles from here on. Chonky boys here.,2
What the fuck?,3
Why Is Bairstow not playing? SRH will surely miss him in this chase,0
Where is axar ?,1
Start the DC v MI match thread already ffs,0
"Why the fuck did Dhawan walk off lmao

I'm pretty sure the umpire gave it out bc he started walking",6
Not out😂,0
Yeah that did not look out,0
Good guy Dhawan giving Pant a chance to bat freely,5
Lol that was so much outside,0
"Why didn't he review it. That looked hitting outside line even in real time. 

If an Indian umpire gives that out all hell breaks loose on r/cricket and it it becomes a meme. If a white umpire gives that out then it's just an error and a bad day at office.",-1
Delhi got soo many power hitters why did iyer even comeout ?,-2
"While batting : wait wait wait

  


While keeping: easy easy easy",8
I think Dhawan was too tired so he just walked off,6
Why tf would he not review that? Looks like he already realized that he can't hit now.,3
Why no Axar 🤬,3
Bad decision. Should have sent Axar.,6
Chonky boys at the crease,1
Should've sent axar...,4
What a good over by Sandeep,0
Why did he start walking on his own? That probably encouraged the umpire to give it out.,5
"Dhawan such a good guy, doesn't want Rashid to feel back by walking next ball.",6
Dhawan shouldn't have walked lmao,2
What the fuck? Where is Dada getting all these ads.,1
Hetti pushing Pant for double- bhai jara dekhle,1
Ahahaha wk saying ezezezezzz,5
Lol dhawan being one of the stupidest batsmen,5
My man jinx is like when will I get to bat coach?,2
Pathetic umpiring,3
EZEZEZ,5
"Honestly, can't help feeling not sending Axar over Pant could cost them 15 or so runs",2
Somene saying easy easy easy when pant is batting,4
Ponting going to kill dhawan!!,8
"Stfu commentators u are dumb. Dhawan knew he was out of steam, better have a fresh guy who can actually hit it out than struggling to get boundaries.",4
Ponting definitely gonna spank Gabbar's ass,5
"Dhawan needs to score 68 in the finals to go past KL as the highest run getter 

BTW Warner needs 125 runs in 2 matches",2
Pant literally getting fatter day by day.,4
Rahane cucked like nothing. Watch them send Axar before him if another wicket falls,4
Why did he not refer it?,5
Who tf walks for a lbw,6
"Just can't see SRH chasing this :(

Very good season considering all the injuries and I just hope they go for it while batting.",6
"Ah Dhawan, pretty sad you missed out on your 100, but silly shot and bad decision to not review.",4
110 SR wtf,2
"Well he should've been caught, so it evens out ig",2
"With Pant out of form, DC has no lower order",4
"RCB is the team that takes all reviews whenever possible

Dc is a team that never takes reviews when they are batting",3
How can a team which was so flamboyant in the last 4 matches suddenly drop to this level. This is just baffling!,5
Sandeep goat,2
Should've sent Axar in. Pant is past it.,1
Lol shikhar,3
"On the plus side for Dhawan, he still has a shot at winning the orange cap next match if he scores 68 more. (Provided DC wins, lol)

Dhawan has scored 603 runs so far, this is the first time he has touched the 600 mark in an IPL season.",5
lmao ThighSlapMan gave no fucks. He played as he pleased and left.,5
"Great death bowling, Sandeep",2
Hetmeyer and Pant.. more hips than the Kardashians put together,14
EASY... EEEASYYYYY,1
Hetmyer not giving strike to Pant,1
18 off one over. Can they do it?,2
So many mistakes from both these teams. This is like the India Kenya 2003 semi final with Australia waiting in the final.,11
Pant looks much faster than Hetmyer...,4
Its like when Kohli walked against Pakistan in the WC and replays show he didn't edge it to the keeper,8
Dhawan didn't review that because he felt sorry for his former team,7
Shit umpiring. Wonder why dhawan didn't take the review. Getting tired maybe,3
"Now please bois, don't give up without a fight 🙏",6
Fantastic bowling sandeep. Deserves more wickets. Well-done mate,12
Chubby cheeks and thick ass.,2
Chad dhawan showing virgin ponting how to walk,10
Dhawan was just tired.. Shikamaru of the team.. 😂,19
Dhavan was so disappointed with playing that sweep shot he even didn't go for 3rd umpire as if he wanted to punish himself,18
Dhawan smelled Hyderabadi biryani from the dressing room and ran towards it without looking at the umpires decision.,25
"This is still bad, should have been easily over 200. But much much better batting than the whole season",3
Hopefully Pant can hit a few shots to finish this and gain some much needed confidence,8
Damn good over Sandeep. Wish you had more support today from the fielding and other bowlers,4
Ok 200+ was never in the cards,1
Feels like the desire for a 6th bowler was felt most today. We could have saved 10-15 runs at least by rotating to Vijay Shankar. I remember how Warner gave Nadeem only 1 over in match  cuz of how well Shankar was. He also bowled in the powerplay.,6
"Why can't, Axar should be there.",2
6 runs in the 19th over,6
Ponting is going to give Dhawan a spanking even if DC win.,3
Sandeep has done his job to perfection. Everyone else had a stinker outing today.,5
Pant is 1.5x the batsman Hetmyer ever will be. Sad to see dumbass indian fans and pundits whining about seNSiBlE baTtInG and ruining such a generational talent.,2
"FUCK'S sake that's a fantastic over by Sandeep, full toss notwithstanding",5
2 sixes from Hetmeyer atleast,1
So Iyer was the imposter in this game...hmmm,6
"Is the crowd chanting ""right arm over! right arm over!"" ?",4
Fr though has Dhawan ever successfully executed that shot?,6
We sacrificed our Whole team fielding skills for Samad to hold on to those.,8
Not reviewing doesn't even make sense over wise. It's penultimate over you can afford to 'waste' a review.,3
Umpiring continues to be shit. Even real time it looked like impact outside off,3
And remember hetymer was benched in the last ge against mI,2
Exactly ppl are saying sandy is trash in desth but he has bowled well for atleast the last few games,3
"Okay SRH isn't chasing this down, get Warner and it's done.",2
"Dealhi peaked again at the right moment, if they bowlers perform well I root for them",3
Mujhe sirf apka hi wicket chahiye. Bitch you don't even reach my waist.,2
Rishab pant can't take two.,2
C'mon Warner. You need to get atleast one man of the match this season,7
Natrajan has been quite good ngl,7
"Dhawan knew he didn't have enough time to get a 100, so he gave his wicket away the first chance he got. 4D chess by the great man /s",2
I hate the word underrated but now I believe Sandy Sharma is underrated,4
Yes natrajan don't take the dinda academy Award away from holder,3
SRH continues to consider Priyam as a better batsmen than Abhishek and Priyam tried his best to prove that wrong until he got injured.,1
Waiting for magical 6(3) from pant,2
[deleted],5
Can Pant hit at least one six?,2
[deleted],7
"Sandeep bowls excellent over under pressure to two set batsman. Gives away just 6 runs.

Commentators: Meh!! 

They would have creamed their pants if this was Bumrah. 

Give credit where it's due",22
Nattu pls spare us from magic 200 mark,0
God we gonna miss Saha/Bairstow in this chase,5
"Pant atleast get this to 200, prove your worth...",5
Mi has 2 in top 5 in both orange and purple cap,3
"Pant in 2018 made 26 runs off a Bhuvi 20th over, let's see what he can do to Nattu this last over",5
Even today Sandeep Sharma has been incredible. He needs a chance with Indian T20I team again.,4
Did Nattu just fucking appeal lmaoooo,5
Who the fuck appealed for that?,5
What are you even appealing for,7
Natu appealing for lbw hahha,5
You don't run two when Pant is there baby,3
Nattu appealing for lbw 🤣🤣,3
Pant is way too huge to try that shot,6
Pant collapsing due to his chonks.,5
Pant is too heavy to get down and play the scoop now,1
tuk-tuk,1
Lmao how do you appeal to that Nattu?,6
Lol appealing for that,2
Good ball nattu,4
Pant gonna have an s/r of less than 100 again,5
I think Dhawan just walked away because he felt he should've gone out on the drop earlier,5
He's three stumps outside off and the bowler is appealing for a lbw.,2
What was Nattu apealing for? Leg before Wicket keeper?,3
Bumrah bowls at death Sandeep bowls in start preachers where are you now ... Sandeep proving himself rn,4
Ball is outside off and pant going for sweep. Typical pant,2
If warner crosses 60 we can chase any target,2
LAMO LBW appeal,1
Natraj appealed for that. XD,2
Lol what was that appeal for?,1
Never underestimate hetmyer in the last matches. He knows an auction is coming up and will perform. Happened in rcb too,6
Lol what was he appealing for?,2
Rishabh eat some hair and choke in it,1
"Dhawan felt that he had outlived his usefulness as he slowed down a bit since his half century, also was probably tired batting since opening",5
That appeal  shows me Nattu might not be the brightest of the bunch,2
"the rate at which pant falls at the crease,give him a pillow and a bedsheet.",9
I am OK with 190 tbh. It should be good enough if we bowl anywhere close to our potential.,2
lmao nattu was appealing for a 7th stump line LBW,6
BC hit down the ground..,2
Should've sent axar imo,2
Het must looks like a Teletubby,2
Petition to remove Murali Karthik and SG from comm box next IPL,2
Huehuehue.. Can't believe Nattu appealed that.,4
Lmao how can you appeal for that. Have some shame sir,5
what was that shimron,2
Man pls power it thru,4
Mind games,3
[removed],6
You guys need to learn from Siraj to play that shot,10
Did Natrajan appeal tht?,7
"Bruh, now I think I was wrong. Dhawan should've taken the DRS and stayed. 



Pant has been ruined totally. Sad for Indian cricket.",12
Good death bowling,6
Pant is done,2
"Pant wanted to sweep Natarajan, except that he couldn't bend down enough to reach it :D",7
"Lol, I really didn't appreciate pants chonkiness before.",5
SHOULDVE SENT AXAR,11
These two overs being so thrifty may end up hurting DC big time.,7
"Good commitment nattu, nice bowling restrict them below 190 we may have chance.",6
Why did Pant deny a second?,1
FFS stop with these fucking shit shots that you've not practiced at all,5
"No disrespek to Delhi fans, but I think DC are gonna choke hard against MI if they make it to the finals.",9
Just bowl 6 Yorkers easy - commentator,8
No need to try cute shots when regular ones are fetching u  runs.,3
Godly Yorkers,4
Cmon man one boundary in the last over atleast,2
Nice Nattu,3
If Holder was a bit more composed while bowling his last over we would have seen a 10 runs less in the target.,4
I haven't seen Pant middle a ball in ages,18
Something happened with pant during lockdown,4
Chubby Pant falling down and trying hard not to roll off towards the boundary.,10
LOL! Weight was UNEVENLY distributed when PANT played that shot!,7
When he gets it right he’s very good tbf,10
Natarajan clutch,6
"Frankly, SRH is bowling team and their success depends on restricting opposition to below average scores. They'll have to bat out of skin to get even closer to today's target. DC clearly the favourites now.",6
"Pant just one boundary, this could be your last IPL match of the season",6
Natarajan begging for lbw when batsman is playing from seventh stump lmaooooo,4
This over is poison for us so far,1
Come back of sort from SRH,2
_kedar jadhav intensifies_,1
"That’s the difference between other teams and MI. From 120-1 Mi would have made it 230. Surya kumar would have come in and gone hitting from
Ball 1 . And then the lower middle order would have murdered them . Other teams don’t have that fire power .",9
Kya bakwas hai yaar. Pant is shit.,3
"Nattu gave way to pant,don't want to collide with the thickness",2
Need to use crease effectively against Natrajan,3
The man's a bowling machine,1
Good total but 200+ was on the cards after the way they started.,3
The slimfit DC jersey does no favour to Pant. The flab needs to be converted into muscle.,5
Stop trying to slog him bc just guide it behind the stumps,1
"Nattu is so wary about covid, he wears a mask even while bowling .",7
Pant is ded,1
4 consecutive Yorkers man,6
Dhawan was probably too embarrassed about that ridiculous shot.,2
This is a high class over by Natarajan so far...,8
Every team seems to nail their yorkers against us. Feels really shit ngl,6
Nattu is such a gem,6
"Dc asking [in Ramsay's voice] ""where's the fulltoss???""",3
Amazing last 2 overs,3
Sandeep looks like one of those hyenas from Lion King,6
SRH wont miss bhuvi at all,8
20 runs short,2
Oh nice to see Garg on the field again,2
Pant is competing with Dhoni for mistiming the ball.,1
Time to drop Pant,2
Yasss boy Garg's back!,3
Shastri and Kohli need to be reported for what they have done to Pant.,13
HOLYSHIT! PANT IS SLOW AF COMPARED TO HETMYER,9
If only Natarajan had access to the best coaches at an earlier age he might have been a mid 140s bowler rather than a high 130s bowler. His success now is owed to Murali.,14
Damn srh really pulled it back. Looked like 200+ at one stage.,2
Need two sixes from thic boi,2
"FFS stop hating on Pant, he just came in and it's not like Hetmyer is able to put away the Yorkers of Nattu",9
4 Yorkers in a row!,9
Hetmyer's saved our ass big time in this game.,5
Dude why just try for unconventional shots? There’s many orthodox shots you can play. No need to be stylish every ball,5
Murli Karthik is making Sanjay Manjrekar sounds like a world class commenter.,9
DC could’ve killed the game by scoring 210 odd. Iyer totally killed the momentum,6
Pant shots not even crossing the pitch today,5
Why is Ponting so angry?,2
How to get a butt just like Heytmyer? Squats?,4
Stop trying to hit him and hit him.,6
Natarajan is a GEM,9
See you in next season. We choke in chasing huge scores.,6
Axar would have done better,3
Garg back in the field bois,2
Just hit me being vertically challenge too Pant gonna find it hard to reach to wide Yorkers unlike Pandya and Pollard 😭😂😭😂,4
How did they not get to 200?,9
Damn Ponting is one intense mf,8
"Pant running two!

What am I seeing here boys",9
"Rishab started season with 160+ sr and now at 152...
He shouldn't be allowed be anywhere near to national side till he gets fit.",9
Big dick Natarajan vs small pp delhi,10
"Left armer bowling gold at the death, wearing no. 44. Remind you of anyone else?",7
Would've been 200+ if not for Iyer,8
190 to win it is then,8
"how the fuck did they not get 200, ridiculous! Great last over from natarajan",4
"Tell me how does Mumbai reach 200 when they're 4 down and 92 runs still to reach 200 with 36 balls left, and we can't reach 200 with just one or two wickets down at that stage with much less runs required to get there? Our batting seemed much more complete and wholesome than Mumbai but they still got more than us.",8
Very very good bowling take this lad to Aus,3
Thank you Nattu for giving us a moral victory,6
What an over.,2
"Oh boy! I am ""Natting""",3
What an absolute last ball by Nattu....,3
Nattu nails 6 Yorkers damn,8
"SRH fans, I think we would have taken 190 as a target given the target.",6
40 runs too many for SRH.,10
embarrassing last two overs this,1
I blame them not getting 200 on Iyer. WTF ARE YOU DOING BRO?!?,10
Decent comeback. Was expecting way beyond 200.,8
That's a superb last over from Natarajan,8
"free run last😡  
.  
great over",2
Nattu beautiful ball man  super cool. Love you man.,11
"Good comeback, was expecting a 220",9
Good over Nattu,7
Natarajan... find of this IPL for me. Awesome last over.,17
Natrajan looks world class when he pulls it off,7
Joke pf an ending for DC. Should just rethink about these middle order batsmen in next auction.,3
brilliant last 2 overs,5
"Natarajan, gets out of bed just before the match.. judging by that cowlick",2
"Today srh bowlers were not good and still they didn't go for 200,",10
Take a bow Natarajan. This is absolutely brilliant,6
Well done Nattu👏🏽,7
What a fucking god over from Natarajan. Our batting in the latter half shat again except Hetmyer and Dhawan. That means Iyer shat the bed,6
11 in the 9 balls since Dhawan's lbw. Ruined the end.,5
"Well bowled Nattu and Sandeep..
Still I guess we have enough on the board..",2
Nattu and Sandeep have bowled excellently. Props to SRH for picking them and then backing them. 👏👏👏👏👏 Take a bow Sandeep and Natarajan.,3
"20 runs short, again due to Iyer and Pant. Even Rahane would've done better.",4
"Wait, they didn’t even get 190?",3
190. Iyer (if DC lose): we were 20 runs short.,2
"Conceded less than 200.


**Moral Victory**",6
Get Warner out and you have one foot in the Final,3
Is 188 reachable?,1
Well bowled Nattu! What a find you are.,6
What a ball. Nice Nattu!,2
"What an over. The final one, no less.",1
Outstanding death bowling.. hopefully we carry through with this small momentum to our batting,4
"Sorry but Rashid and a few SRH players have likely fixed this, It's terrible to drop such catches at this level, It almost cannot happen unless you deliberately did it.",-5
I’m glad Natarajan is going to Australia. Just hope Bumrah convinces him to #breakthebeard,10
Definitely need a warner 100 and lots of dew for the match to be Little bit interesting,4
[deleted],4
What an over Nattu.,8
189 might not be good enough,2
DC has either scored 40 runs extra or 20 runs less. We will know in 2 hours time.,6
"SRH can't make this without Saha, do they",4
Micro victory for srh there at the end but dc still large favorites 80/20 I reckon,3
"SRH have done well to pull the score back after being taken for 100-1 in 10 overs by DC. All thanks to Shreyas Iyer. SRH is certainly the underdog in this match and I support the underdog team, let's go Warner!! Put up a show tonight ⚡⚡",4
It's ok Hetmeyer wp,2
Fantastic last over,6
"If Pant and Hetmyer collide, it could lead to the formation of a black hole.",9
good find SRH. whatabowler Nat,2
Nattu is half the reason for successful NNN by Indian viewers.,3
SRH bowlers did a great job in restraining DC after the start they got,2
Anything below 200 and srh favorites with dew factor,2
Shreyas cost the team yet again. Can we sack him next year?,-2
His Yorkers are too good. We should’ve hit 200 but I feel like 190 is a winning score. Need Warner’s wicket early.,9
200 should've been minimum,3
SRH must be happy with the final score.,2
Excellent death bowling.,8
"Natto is worth is weight in gold!!!


6yorkers!!!",7
"Overwhelming odds in favour of DC.
Its Delhi's game to lose.",2
Never seen a bowler so good at yorkers.,9
Koach needs to have a heart to heart with Pant (maybe Rohit too) about fitness. He knows a thing or two about going from chubby to Greek god,6
"Warner still looks cool , love you captain. Hope you and ~~kane~~ Jesus hits well and win this for us",4
This is chaseable for sure. Need a quick Warner start though.,2
Warner or Game over for us,3
The name Shimron sounds like a DBZ villan ngl..,5
Nattu just walked in and bowled 6 perfect yorkers like it was nothing...,7
Still 190 is a good comeback after 100 odd in the first 10 overs.,3
Now you guys tell me . Who would you rather have batting at no 4 for india . Iyer or SKY ?,6
My boi nattu showing how it's done.,5
Nattu is wasted as a net bowler ffs. What do you want to practice? How to handle the Yorker? Come on you can have others do that for u in practice.,8
Get Warner early and it's game over baby,2
So we'll be batting without garg I suppose?,2
Tough but doable total. Not the 220 I had feared earlier. But still advantage to DC. We still need a Warner special with some support in the middle.,5
SRH actually bowled well today especially Sandeep he is really underrated,-1
Both teams should be happy here. Delhi for a solid score and Hyderabad for excellent death bowling,2
"If I were in the DC changing room, I’d keep the bats away from Ponting.",7
I badly want Natrajan in Indian T20 side,3
2 good overs in end prevented Delhi from reaching 200. Underwhelming finish.,1
"Fucking hey, Natarajan!

&#x200B;

At peast we have somet to bowl at.",2
That last over from Natarajan was something!  Almost laser guided!,2
Even if he lacks variety I would still take Natarajan in India's t20 squad,10
Exceptional bowling in the 19th and 20th over by SRH! Could prove to be clutch if SRH end up coming close to this total.,7
Last 2 overs only 13 runs,3
"I understand that yorkers are effective, maybe wide yorkers even more so. But is it a relatively recent tendency to bowl so many of them instead of variations? Not that yorkers are easy to bowl but shouldn't you have more confidence in yourself as a bowler to bowl less predictably and maybe even go for wickets? (this isn't about Natarajan alone)",2
"Excellent last over by Nattu, kind of flawless. DC did sure miss hitting 10-15 runs in the end.",6
"With dew and good start from warner, we still have a chance right?",2
Nattu is a superstar.,6
"If Warner chases this down, then mods can happily change my flair to ""Warner's bitch""",6
"Dhawan should have reviewed, expecting pant to finish with flourish didn't pay off",3
"All those on the Kane bandwagon when he chased 130 in the 20th over, Let's see if he chases 190 tonight",6
7 run final over by Nattu!!,3
Good job Delhi going home with 7 wickets in hand and still not reaching 200.,2
Natarajan is a yorker machine. A year with top class fitness coaches will make him faster. Then he will be lethal.,6
DC 65 : 35 SRH,0
Warner gets a lot of flak for his attitude but he didn't get angry even once even though he knows he will have to score a ton if they want to win this. He kept smiling throughout and praised bowlers who bowled well.,10
Outstanding final over by nattu,3
Only winning this if Goswami plays Sahaesque innings.,2
"Inb4 Warner 144(83), only way i can see srh win this",7
Can't believe SRH's bowling held DC to under 200 runs. That's incredible despite their shit bowling in the power play and awful fielding.,2
Agent Nadeem played for Delhi today while Good guy Iyer neutralized the effect.,4
"Pant 2(3)

This sub: worst finisher ever, kick him out, chonky useless guy",6
"If Natty were 10ks faster, he would be as good as Bumrah.",7
"Hetmyer 42*(22). I'll take that any time, any format. Good job.",8
"Arey 200 toh pauch jate.
Still decent if this is our last match well played.
But hopeful we might make it. Blowers need to bring apna best game.",3
pant's batting is painful to watch these days.,5
"The way these games have been going, SRH will be 15/4 off 4.",5
"With the form we showed in last 6 matches, most DC fans should be overjoyed with this total. Yeah we could have scored more but then we could have messed it up badly and easily.",7
See no way Sunrisers chase this.,3
"meh finish but ok I guess

Making 190 against SRH's bowling lineup is still good",6
Can’t finish NNN after watching that final over from Natarajan,10
Match ka mujarim Iyer.,2
Wait who the fuck is Pravin? Is it Pravin Kumar? Oh mygod. Can it be true?,1
I remember Pollard trying to pull off this fancy shots in the past. Unsurprisingly he was absolutely terrible during that time. He seems to have matured now and sticks to his strength of bludgeoning it down the ground.,4
"If Mumbai has best uncapped batting talent, Hyderabad got best uncapped bowling talent... What a great finish by nattu and sandeep..",10
Dehli capital's fans should be happy with this score. They got 20-30 runs extra runs becuz of poor fielding.,9
"I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 deliveries once, but the man who has practiced one delivery 10,000 times.",43
"Looking at how DC lost their way in middle overs, I still feel they do not have the fire power to challenge MI if they reach Finals.",7
This is going to be a thriller,0
Roar of the lion is such a pretentious documentary.,3
DC... you're a good 15 runs short of where you should have been...,1
"DC had us in the not gonna lie, first-half.",3
Shame Natarajan doesn't have wickets to show for this brilliant spell,6
A Nadeem disaster class today.,2
Goswami is utter dogshit,6
Our bowling has been godly for the last few games so this is expected. Batsmen should step up now for once.,5
Would be nice if Goswami or Pandey can support Warner at the top.,7
I remember DC posting a high target for SRH (courtesy a brilliant 128* by Pant) but Warner & Bairstow made mockery of that chase.,1
Delhi are favourites right now.,6
I'll take 190. Given that warner and pandey can partner for a good powerplay,5
Please go and spam #breakthebeard on Nattu's Insta,12
Where is that guy who predicted SRH winning this season? Please show us the path. I don't think it'll happen unless warner gets a century today,20
"Have srh ever chased this much this ipl.

Will have to play out of their skin to win this.",8
Goswami  to win it for SRH,2
Good last over but why did Nattu try this before is beyond me. Instead he was bowling slow balls and pies.,4
I am worried that natarajan won't take off his neckbeard now coz of superstitions.,20
Thank god for Shimron Hetmyer. Can't spell Shimron Hetmyer without hero,8
DC ahead here. 190 is never easy to chase but SRH should know that this is definitely within reach.,11
Dhawan scored just 27 of last 24 balls,21
Lara my eyes are burning,5
Finals probably going to be South Mumbai brats versus South Delhi imps,10
Nattu seems like a fine prospect. Proper grooming and training without injuries could spell a bright career for him,12
I think Natrajan has even more accuracy on his yorkers than Bumrah and Starc. What a find for SRH.,1
This season's form can be a lesson for Pant to quench his inner foodie Delhiite and focus on fitness as long as he plays,10
I am impressed with Natrajan but that beard makes it hard for me to support him .,13
Hetmyer looking like he failed his team. He kinda did. It needed to be 200+. At least they dont have to deal with Saha.,-16
"> Sunriders will chase this in 10 ovars!! Go Daniel Warnar

Actual comment on Hotstar.",45
"Congratulations DELHI.

Hope you win your first IPL trophy this year.",7
"Natarajan will be good for India having Shami bowl aggressively in start , chahal in mid overs and Bumrah and nattu in death",10
I’m proud of our team. They showed a lot of character despite many errors and restricted them to 189. I mean they were looking at 210+ lol given the start.,9
Too many runs. SRH can only win if Warner plays outstandingly innings.,8
F for SRH who traded Dhawan to DC lmao,-4
"To summarise DC innings:

Hulk smashes and Shaw learns a lesson


Dhawan didn't score a duck and hence beat SRH to death


Iyer made sure DC doesn't reach 200


Hetmyer ensured he fetches some value next auction


Pant didn't middle a single ball just like whole season",17
190 = 200 considering it's a playoff game.,4
Ponting should make Iyer write bowling plans on his hand...so that he doesn't fk up,7
[They hated r/anuraag09 when he told them the truth. Dhawan struck at 110 after 40 balls](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/jqarkr/match_thread_qualifier_2_delhi_capitals_v/gbma4vl?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3),10
Gonna be really really tough for us,4
We should bowl around the wicket from ball 1 against Warner.,3
"Hetmyer has done very well, should not be left for next season",14
No boundaries in the last two overs!,14
"Angry Smashing Warner, or out quickly Warner?",2
Need to give credit to Pointing. Dropped Shaw and promoted Stoinis in such a crucial game.,10
SRH should approach this chase with a very positive mindset. 190 isn’t that steep when you get a good start in the powerplay,8
I got downvoted to hell yesterday for asking if Lara is gay.,-6
"Guys, Serious question - If Pant had played that shot in LORDS, given that slope there would he have rolled off to the boundary?",8
This 188 reminds of the match where Rishabh pant scored century and then Shikhar and Williamson chased it down with ease,6
"We have too many for a bowling attack with Rabada, Nortje. If we lose this, we deserve to go out.",7
Dropping Shaw has had such a positive impact on the DC lineup lmao,10
"On other note, stop asking Nattu to get rid of his neckbeard no matter how outrageous it looks to us. Poor guy nailed that last over and it's No Shave November as well",6
Natarajan is travelling to Aus with Indian team. Will he be able to see his newborn soon?,5
"‘Jaha  mauka badda, vaha sarpanch ban kar aate hain.’

What? 😂😂",2
"Still some good positives from that bowling performance, Nadeem won’t be in the team next year and Holder will have less overs. Bhuvi being back will only add to this attack.",2
20 runs short to where they should have been but still a very good total,2
Natru once again doing great. Good to know hes on the plane in India. India's pace resources are abundant otherwise he should be in the first team. Death bowling would be solved with him and Bumrah.,3
I'd definitely take a 20(12) from Goswami at this point.,6
"How even when we get a decent total does it feel like we totally fucked up?

Won't complain though, more than I was expecting before this game started.

Just gotta hope David Warner doesn't make this score look like a joke. He tends to do that no matter what score Delhi puts out there.",2
"Delhi started off with Hetmyer at 3 in the first game but for no reason under-used him and wasted him by giving 5 balls every game by batting him at NO.6. 

Today was a lesson for them that Hetmyer is a better T20 batsman than Iyer will ever be.",6
That beard might be the only thing keeping Natarajan out of the Indian squad.,17
"If rabada and Nokia get their form back, we'll be nailed at 80 all out",3
"Reckon this would've been a different match if Holder ""held"" on to that catch. It would've definitely exposed the DC middle order.",13
30 runs short imo,1
"If Iyer didn't play a shit innings, 200+ was on",5
Where do I see the live ball tracking of this match?,1
It's like that Qualifier 2 we played against Gujarat Lions in 2016 we had to chase high score I reckon 185(?). Warner carried us with his 93.,5
Kanos should open with Warner,6
"A lot of pessimism regarding SRH's chances in this thread, but I'm still confident, hopefully and have faith in the team to pull through. However, if Delhi wins today hopefully they go on to the win their first trophy on Tuesday.",5
not as many as they could have scored if Iyer unkil not dragged them down,6
"Although Iyer played slow, you all forget DC can actually hit the balls of only 16 overs (that too of Sandeep, Natrajan, etc.)

Rashid is a hack.",3
Salty they didn’t send proven finisher Axar in,2
Guys you think DC should've reached 200 looking at their opening but I think you are not giving enough credit to this SRH bowling. Reaching 190 against this bowling is as good as reaching 200 or more.,3
Imagine games like these with a crowd. God I miss those days,3
I think Dhawan just walked off instead of reviewing because he thought Pant would be better able to handle the last 2 overs. He was wrong.,18
"Dhawan has gone full Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in last month

His last 12 innings:

5, 69 *, 57, 101 *, 106 *, 6, 0, 0, 54, 0, 78",10
It wasn't poor bowling effort but poor fielding that got us here.,13
"Hypothetically if wickets would have fallen. Rahane would have come after Axar Rabada to finish this, would have been interesting to see",7
I would've considered this a win of we finished the match with no injuries but we can't even have that,4
They should send Rashid khan to open with warner. He would fare much better than Goswami,6
Pandey garu please perform today.,5
"Fuckers cant hit Sandeep Sharma at Death

How do i even hope they wont shit the bed against Bumrah?",7
"with saha, we could chase this",5
Is Warner doing a Boman Irani from Munna Bhai? Smiling through all the pain and anger?,7
Vitamin D chappati ftw,2
"Even with Saha and 3D, which I think is the full strength of SRH, this is a tall ask.",4
"Dhawan wanted to use the toilet, so he gave himself out.",5
Dew there?,2
Seems like number of people watching on hotstar has decreased compared to previous games....surprising considering these are the eliminators,2
"A bit reactionary, but after this innings I don't want to see Shaw again",9
We gave away 20 runs easily in the field. Not our day,22
SRH chollapse incoming,4
Apple Store delivery sucks ass in India as of now. I ordered on 24th Oct and it's still not here!,6
Does anybody have the original IPL 2020 schedule that was made for the original dates in March/April before covid-19 pandemic hit?,2
[deleted],5
"Seeing how calm warner is when he plays for us , wtf happens to him while playing for Aus",7
Y no one taking about last 2 overs from srh easily saved 15 runs,5
"while(next\_batsman=Rahane)

{

printf(""Fuck Rahane, get the next man in"");

printf(""Fuck Shaw too"");

}

PS: This code has been sponsored by whitehat jr. For any complaints contact them directly.",10
"Feel DC are 10-15 runs short, the pitch looks good and if Warner fires on all cylinders they may win this thing.",2
In before goswami goes breask today,4
"We would've had a chance of Saha was there. But with Goswami, pretty fucking sure we're gone",3
"Though it look likes SRH might have pulled back in last two overs , still wont be any easy for them.",4
The female anchor sounds like Kelly Kapoor from The Office,6
"Hetmyer - I told Dhawan it's outside but he turned down and walked.




🤣🤣",40
Dropping Shaw and bringing up Stoinis is a master stroke and suddenly delhi looks favorites for me for finals... Incoming ashwins over in power play and warner sweeping incoming!,7
Natarajan's beard makes him look like one of people who wear their masks on their chins,9
What's technically better? Check drives or a flourish of the wrist?,4
If Goswami scores a quick 20-30 that will be a huge bonus here,9
Please mankad today it’s the only way we can win.,4
"im kinda happy the target is high, because we dont deserve the cup if we can't bat",5
"I said it a while earlier, but I'll say it again: I feel like Iyer's job was to protect Hetmyer and Pant from Rashid, and he did that pretty well. He did okay",8
I think this is still poised to be pretty tight,1
So highest successful chase for us was 155 vs RR,16
Lara rubbed the test cricket ball all over his pant,2
Inb4 Goswami leaves all balls in first over,7
warner goes gL2016 mode. Pandey comes out blazing. Williamson repeats that innings against dc in 20188 where we chased 180 odd. Holder at the end to finish it off. I believe,8
"So everyone agrees, fuck Prithvi Shaw",17
The good thing about this match is that we won’t see Shaw in the finals if we make it. Already a win!,15
"Although Dhawan did good but this might come back to bite them :

Hetmyer says he felt that Dhawan lbw was outside off, but he says Dhawan just turned around and walked, giving him no chance to ask him to review",7
We prolly lose this by 20 runs.,6
Omg Lara still thinks we can make it.,9
Test the batting order day 2,6
srh need kkr manish pandey,8
"First time our bowlers have to back our batters this season, always been the opposite all other games",4
don't want to see another Mumbai vs Delhi,8
"Balling: 6/10

Fielding: -1/10",7
Should Natrajan be a part of the limited overs squad for India considering his expertise at the death?,4
Dhawan walked to balance out the incoming Mankad today. Ethics^TM,8
DC today with all dem buffs and enchantments,4
Dhawan thought scoring three centuries one season would be illegal because of the law of averages.,7
I think Rishabh like me just wanked and played video games in the lockdown.,6
"Well on the bright side, we haven’t seen samad in awhile, we can finally see him today",7
"What went wrong for SRH this match:


Usually, they pick a couple of wickets in the powerplay and then apply the spin choke.


But when the chances were dropped, DC had a good start and went all out against every bower except Rashid who they played out.",7
Please SRH atleast get to 170 and win our hearts,10
Rahene is a specialist fielder for today,7
Srh is gonna shit the bed like rr did against kkr 100% sure,6
"Only two 190+ totals have been chased this season where we saw Lord Tewatia and Lord Stokes at it, will we see another Lord tonight?",6
Dhawan is like those Anime heros who attacked at the end to destroy villan,4
Delhi has the best bowling attack. Atb srh,7
I will be shitting my pants if DC opens with Ashwin against warner,5
Warner special coming up?,4
They should've declared at 160,9
Ashwin vs Warner lessgooooo,6
Rabada is only allowed 1 wicket,2
"Remember that Stoinis hitting it big couldn't even bring DC close to MI target in Q1. No matter how good Warner is, no way he is doing this alone.",7
Pant vs Hetmyer on potential and where you see them 10 years from now,6
[removed],8
"I forgot dc has ashwin , isnt his stats great against warner 
 
*Fuck*",7
Goswami don't be a Go Swami today please 🙏,4
Vimgel wadaaa player ..,3
I'm telling you right now they are not chasing this. Game's over,4
"DC fans, irrespective of whether you win or lose today, I think Ponting and Kaif really need to set Pant straight. The dude was horrific and his running made me think he was in his late thirties. How is this guy supposed to be in his mid-twenties? 

I’ll admit I’m not one to talk because I became fat too during the lockdown but I ain’t getting paid millions for my fitness.",10
How many of you will log off after Warner gets out early?,9
Both of Delhi’s opening bowlers are South African. This is a knockout game. Absolutely no pressure then,9
Now hopefully Iyer doesn’t do round robin bowlers during captaincy. Ashwin needs to bowl 3 in the power play like everyone and their mother knows.,3
Why the hell are they taking a pic now!?,2
[Hope this Warner shows up](https://m.cricbuzz.com/live-cricket-scorecard/16447/gl-vs-srh-qualifier-2-indian-premier-league-2016),2
What is the point of this mid innings photo shoot ?,3
New MOTM today for Srh??,3
"I dont care who wins, just dont let MI win another cup",8
Why the players carrying pillows while leaving their hotel ?,2
"Photoshoot of Delhi.


Oh No, I am in danger.",10
Decent comeback from SRH imo. Could be a half decent chase if they avoid some brainfades,8
Goswami can't stand a chance with Rabada's and Nortje's pace.,3
R Ashwin and Y Chahal together in t20 for India? Will it be a good combination?,2
That's weird.,1
just me or hyderabad players looked really lethargic in field? terrible fielding display. guess just one day of rest isn't enough specially when every game that you're playing is a knockout one.,4
Shikhar got 50 from 26 and then 28 from 24.,1
Wtf are they taking a picture in the middle of the game for?,2
Has Shaw gone bald already?,1
Highest chase by srh has been 155 this season 😂🤣😭😭😭,10
"Yes Iyer is better than sky.....



Better at choking his team with dots....",4
"Lot of ignorant fans saying they are 20 runs short.

For them who never even played even a competitive street game it is all like a math equation where in x overs if you already got so much by 'Y' number of over they should have got this much. They don't understand this is sport and there will be ebbs and flows in the game and there is also an opposition playing in the game.

DC did a damn good job and disrupted SRH's game in the first half.",3
DC should open the bowling with KG Rabada and Anrich Nortje,2
"So what do we think, 150-7?",5
Why did we let go of Hetmyer ffs.,4
I actually hope that the batsman hits a six everytime Ashwin suddenly stops and then bowls,6
"Goswami is going to be the key here. 

With a 35(20) he can set the match up for SRH, or with a 2(8) he can break the match down for SRH.",3
"With the Delhi opening bowlers, goswami is a walking wicket",3
"Showing MPL as making lives better has to be such a shitty thing, wish our censor board was more krodith over this than kisses",5
"Missing my man Saha. I know India duties are more important, but damn would have been worth an arm and a leg rn",2
Cheer up Trevor,1
Delhi could've gotten 200 but Kohli's pet poodle sucked away the momentum and then the last few overs were decent,1
"RCB took their team photo because they knew they were scheduled to lose. Today DC taking team photo and not SRH, clear indication of what's to come. It's all fixed SMH my head /s",7
Incoming Warner 100(45),-2
"The two coaches with no expressions :

1. Justin Langer

2. Trevor Bayliss",3
DC taking a class photo in case they don't make it to the finals.,2
Who was that cutie in orange?,1
"Just when commentators said Malinga can bowl 6 yorkers and while Nattu can’t cuz he has a limit, my man Nattu shatters their opinions.",7
Seems like a good for Mankad.,2
"✋ DC vs SRH

👉 Rashid Khan vs Ravichandran Khan.",0
I'm extremely terrified of Warner tonight. I've seen him take it away from Delhi over the seasons way too often.,3
"Ashwin doesn't stop, it's your stream glitching",4
Hopefully Saha will recover before the Aus tour...he is a great wicketkeeper,4
OMG it's Garg wtf,12
FUCK YEAH GARG OPENING,11
Bit odd taking team pictures in the middle of the game. Could be as fatal as celebrating a milestone mid job.,3
"Come on Delhi, beat those Hyderabadis.",1
Are the DC boys attempting a reverse jinx with that picture?? xD,1
Srh need to play well atleast for that chic,4
"I am calling it 


Warner goes beserk today",8
Boy oh boy we have Garg opening! Come on India U-19 captain!,5
Is this the make the injured guy open and hit out strategy they tried with Williamson?,2
Wait surprise openers game lol,3
Garg probably to counter Ashwin as well.,2
Garg maybe injured... he'll just swing in the PP and get out...like Kane vs KKR,2
WARNER NICKS OFF FIRST BALL,2
Fuck Yes Delhi Capitals the champions of refridgerator rights and equality of defenestration rights,1
Why Garg is opening?,1
"Bro, who tf is reading this thread? Stoin and Garg opened this match.",1
Happy with this order change,2
Hold your momos delhi Here comes our stoinis,1
Atleast Garg's finally allowed to play wildly without being exposed to pressure situations all the time,3
Just tuned into the match. Is Saha playing?,3
Garg opening. Nice,1
"Goswami is a walking wicket, they cant take chances with Kane, so trying with Garg... neverthe less all experiments dont succeed!!!",2
"Warner and Garg: Baniye ka dimag, Miyanbhai ki daring.",3
"Blue vs red ft IPL.

Can red catchup?",2
"Garg is waste anywhere, might as well open with him as well",0
Garg,1
Great opportunity for Garg,1
Goswami IPL career strike rate is in the same league as Cheteshwar Pujara LoL,2
I like this kid but it's too much pressure I believe.,3
Big opportunity for Garg,2
Thank god it's not Goswami.,4
Are we really letting Garg face Nortje and Rabada? Poor kid.,1
Good step to open with Priyam. Give the kid licence to hit out and express himself.,5
Ashwin first over.... this is all Ponting and his evil schemes.,5
"I absolutely hate that no matter who wins this match, Gavaskar isnt going to shut his stupid mouth after Mumbai win the final",6
Didn't realise Garg was kinda tall since he has a really big fucking head,3
congratulations Mumbai on winning the IPL,5
They are trying that Williamson trick with Garg maybe. Make as many as you can in the pp,4
"Rule 1: If you're injured, you ain't getting a rest you gotta freaking open",12
Warner needs to channel back his Ashes'19 energy.,0
Ashwin is opening the bowling wow,3
srh really fucked up their action for their batting. i mean a guy with 115 sr and 1 50 is opening for them in a semi final,2
 Garg might be a decent choice tbh,3
Ethical start to the innings,5
Lmao Garg opening. Gone inside 3 overs,1
Almost gone fuck,2
um why is priyam garg opening,1
I like Ashwin. But I hope that he doesn't take Warner's wicket.,2
Gravity defied big ass reaching to that catch lol,2
Dc missed a possible 0/3,2
Hetty's jersey number 😳,2
Don't mind the garg punt. Personally feel like there's a class player in there,3
Its a good move Right hand left hand combo..,2
Why is a 117 sr batsman opening?,3
Yeah. Hopefully the shit fielding consumes DC now like it did SRH,2
_for a minute there i lost myself_,3
"Oh man, Garg looks like he is 13 lol",5
Reminds me of the match when KKR opened with Yusuf Pathan and CSK with Ashwin,1
Ashwin got Warner in first over in 2014 scg test,2
"Told ya, Garg won't stay long. Only few overs maximum",-1
Bruh why is Saha not playing?,-1
"What is Pant's favorite song?

*Make some noise for the DC boys*",9
"I was rooting for Goswami

New MOTM  for SRH. Wtf garg",7
Ashwin's beard is weird,3
They might be doing what they did with Williamson after his injury,6
Did I just see Ashwin chanting some mantras there?,3
prediction : warner lbw this over,2
if he's injured he may as well hit out and get out in the powerplay,5
Need that Mankad from Ash,6
Bitch yes,1
Yes gargy boy good start,6
Woooooooooow,2
Chasing 190 and 117 SR guy is opening,-8
Ohno,4
Good start,4
Nooooo,4
Oh yeaaaaaah. Come on 🔥,5
Holy fuck garg,5
Take a single.,0
Shot,3
Beautiful,2
Hot damn,3
Manish pandey to do 2014 final heroics,6
Ashwin who? /s,8
These dudes sent a 19 year old to open in a 190 chase to get to the IPL final.,11
Smashed!,1
"Wait what ,garg?",1
An 18 year old just smacked Ashwin for 6. Retire now Ash /s,0
Pag didn’t come to fuck around,3
"DC: Plays a pinch hitter as an opener

SRH: Hmmmmmmmm",13
[deleted],3
mankad incoming,3
Feels like SRH are gonna chase this easily.,1
Pant touching that ass real smooth,6
We might lose,1
Subhanallah,2
"Pant bc, don't jump on the batsman.",5
Already better than Goswami,6
Pant's commentary when?,3
you had I N T E N T and now you also have C O M M I T,4
SRH run rate 18 we are fucked,2
Ez ez ez,2
This is going to be a really interesting chase,1
Pant improved his keeping but kinda forgot how to bat,3
Pant mofo trying to get on Garg,3
"DC gonna win:

Reference: we have a player called AshWIN, not AshLOSE.",13
"Saha legit made of glass, gets injured way to frequently",5
Remember Injured Kane going bang bang in one match. We have Priyam now trying to replicate that.,2
Notice how solidly Warner stays in the crease at the non strikers end ? That’s how it should be,8
dc fans already turned to pessimism.,5
Oh fuck.,1
Wide bc,1
"Why hasn’t Saha opened today, he was in red hot form",-1
Remember that Delhi have a newbie spinner in the attack. 190 is not impossible at all.,10
"That's the one place you don't bowl to garg, he always does that move lmao",4
"Two sides, aswin wants to stumping. Bowling deliberately",3
Was an 18 year old garg made to face the first ball,8
I'd love to see vintage Warner again. Century please David!,6
I have a bad feeling about this,4
David warner has a very likable personality,6
Great start by SRH,3
"So, for which team is Finch gonna go and win the Orange Cap next year?",6
Damn Pant keeping on point,3
DC fans spamming those reverse jinx comments lol,3
Unethical over,5
SRH confused DC last time by opening with Saha. Today they're doing the same thing with Garg.,10
"Sunrisers have backed Garg in every match when he’s only had one good performance, time to repay that faith",8
"chill out, dc fans. we still have 180 more runs to get",3
"Just need to get Warner, it's game over .",3
this is messy as shit,2
"Ponting: Let's open with stoinis he even opens in BBL.

Trevor Bayliss: I have a better idea. DC will never know what hit them.",7
I just dont want MI to win,4
Good over by Ashwin standards,-2
"Keep calm Priyam my boy, you'll get more chances to hit out.",3
Sunny ji with his usual uncle jokes. Smh. Back to Telugu commentary,4
Will having 3 spinners backfire?,1
"I hate how they change the zones on the pitch map to push a particular narrative. If they wanna call it good balling, they mark it as 'Full Length' and if they wanna call it bad ball, they call it 'The Slot'",1
Loving the banter between Pommy and Sunny 😂,1
Delhi Bois start praying that rabada doesn't have a 1 for 52 day,1
"How tall is Priyam Garg?! 

Looks so tall up close but avg from far....",2
In one over they yanked my soaring smile down. I’m scared.,2
Priyam Garg was probably a small kid watching Ashwin in 2011/2012 as a young spinner doing well in IPL. Now he's hitting him for sixes.,3
Rabada gonna get Warner in this over,69
"A tough chase for SRH

Just a good start in powerplay not gonna be enough like in previous matches",3
I think this is in the bag for DC. It is in their game to lose now.,1
*GameOver*,3
Oof. Rabada.,3
Game over. Great game bois,3
LEZGOOOO,3
battle to watch : rabada vs warner,4
HOLY FUCK RIP SRH FUCKKK,4
Get yorked bitch!!!!!!,6
"goswami is useless, pandey is hit or miss, holder has had a bad day today, williamson is a 130 chase specialist

so get Warner, win the game

edit: game over",10
RABAAADDAAAAAA,3
Hammayya,2
holy fuck,2
Ma hi chod dia rabada benchoooooo,8
What a ball. That's the match. Bye bye boys,3
RABADA CANT TAKE WICKETS IN POWERPLAY. TALK NAH AB,9

Okay no more wickets pls,3
Keep calm and trust Rabada,3

RABADAAAAAA!!!,2

Fuck yeahhhhhhhhhh. Warner blacked tonight,1
Wow what a ball from rabada 1st up,1
Rabada:“Fuck yes”!😂,7
Another Xbox for Archer.,6
Game over,2
Rabada you beauty,3
"Rabada, you god",2
See u in the finals dc,2
Rabada takes DC to final on the first ball he bowls,8
gg,7
gg guys,7
OH NOOOOOOOOOO,2
Killer blow,2
It was a good tournament..,3
Fucking hell,2
Was this a replay of Bumrah's bowl to Dhawan?,7
thats the game,2
hahahaha,2
KAGISOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO,4
"Well, goodbye SRH, give us kane next year please",5
WOOOOOHOOOOOO FUCK YES RABADA BABYYYYYYY,7
Just few bad games and people really started doubting Rabada,8
Just need to get kanos now and we got this match,10
Game done,4
Rabada seems genuinely pumped about that wicket. A great boost for him.,9
That kinda day for us,6
"Finals DC vs MI


Congratulations to MI for their 5th title",10
Bye Warner,3
YEAAAAAAHHHHHHH,5
Oooff. DC is thrilled,5
That's the game lads,5
That's the match probably,5
DID WE JUST,7
"That gentleman is Game set and match. 

It was already over when they posted 189. But now it's a certainty.",8
Oof KG!!,1
Rip SRH,1
You love to see it,3
"RIP, see ya next season bois",3
"Game is done, Warner needed to fire today",2
R A B A D A A A A A A,4
Good luck in the finals DC. Time for a new winner,7
"After Last match hammering, KG is back in style",3
"Damn, that was a spectacular delivery",5
It was fun while it lasted,5
Its inevitable that Sunny G in this mood will unleash his deadly Caribbean accent.,8
gg,3
Congrats mumbai,5
Nattu and Rabada got the most beautiful wickets this week,5
Pommie Mbwanga is a wholesome dude.,4
On your bike Dave,8
Pack your bags now SRH,1
GG guys.... Trend is to bowl yorkers for first ball in powerplay!!!,4
Kagiso's Revenge,4
Faf : *My boy*,8
OH MY GOD KAGISO IT'S FUCKING NO NUT NOVEMBER,8
We're done,2
AAAAAAAA,3
It's okay let's just enjoy the last match of our season.,10
YESSSSSSSS RABADA FUCK YES,3
Rabada meri jaan,3
That gave my Q1 Shikhar's wicket PTSD,4
Everyone jinxed Warner :(,5
"**1.1** Rabada to Warner, OUT, bowled him. Lovely ball but Warner also sightly unlucky to get out to this **12-1**

DA Warner  b Rabada 2 (3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 66.66",3
Holy shit. Didn't expected that.,3
Rabada should really bowl these Yorkers more wow,2
damn rabada had to come in form today?????? :(((((,4
"What a ball.

Of course, there has never been any animosity between Rabada and Warner.",11
Time for SRH to prove they can win without Warner.,5
"now switch off your TV/stream, save energy",1
FUCKING KG I LOVE YOU!!,3
Oh no. Anticlimactic that was.,1
Rabada with that #Sextillion7thPower,5
Dayum RABADA! That was a Jaffa!,3
Pandey to shine with a 20(25),1
Fuck...,3
Gg,1
DC pls beat mi in the finals,3
Bumrah to Dhawan > Rabada to Warner,8
Ye bhi theek hai 😞😞😞,2
Even I can't wish Kanos anna to get out.,3
GG,1
What a ball to open your spell with,2
"Breathe guys- and when you exhale, say fuck it.",6
"Sorry to any SRH flairs users reading this, but its not looking too good for you right now",4
what no yjb in?,1
Lol I just realized Rahane is playing today,1
[deleted],1
Rabada boy we need that purple cap back! Finish them!!,2
I liked the days when we were not hyped to be the favorites,3
"gg guys, going back to my shitty life",3
"If srh still manage to win this, then there's a Warner special in the finals then",2
"GG Delhi, y'all better beat Mumbai's ass. I'm rooting for you!",3
"Ashwin- Got yanked as he always does
Rabada- Oh no, anyway....",2
Did you look at the swing on that,1
I miss 3D now,2
Reminds me of Starc vs Mccullum,1
Rabada took a leaf out of Bumrah's playbook,1
Sad Butta Bomma noises.,5
"harsha: does priyam garg have a free hand to play some shots?

sunnyG: no, warner can play shots, he should just knock it around. Who the fuck promotes someone to open the batting in a 190 chase to knock the ball for singles? Sunny should just retire from commentary already, seriously.",2
t20 franchises doing unexpected things in pressure games. International teams need to learn to not be so rigid.,2
Gg,3
Alright guys its packup time,2
Now THAT is a peach 🍑,1
This is where SRH needed Johnny. He seems to play best when his back is to the wall . This situation would have been made for him.,3
"Rabada exacting revenge for Warner trying to brawl with towel Faf, circa 2017",2
"*Form is temporary, class is permanent bitches* - Kagiso ""Purple Cap"" Rabada",5
Playoffs Episode 3: Revenge of the Rabada,2
The Revenge of Kagiso Rabada,5
Warner seeing rabada as Broad,3
Warner can smile in his way back journey to Australia.,6
Sunny G is the only commentator who thinks of IPL as it is - a first class tournament for spotting new talent and existing talent to show their game skills. You can see that when he says that youngsters should take the opportunity given to them.,12
Rabada is getting big swing bc fuck yes,3
"Delhi, see you again on Tuesday",2
Manish to do 2014 encore,3
"“Okay, match over”

Cricbuzz",6
What the fuck is this swing oh my god,3
Holy crap that swing,3
Are we suddenly in Perth on Day 1 of a test?,5
"And MI gets their 5th title. Sorry, don't expect DC to do anything against MI.",3
2 slips in a chase of 190 in an IPL Qualifier.,4
"Doesn't matter if he's playing for South Africa or Delhi Capitals, nothing gives Rabada more pleasure than getting Warner out",4
Hopefully Pandey doesn’t slow down,1
Mil gayi Chase Pinde mein....Warner pasha Baingan pe out ho gaye,4
Kagiso *Sandeep Swingeshwar Sharma* Rabada,2
SRH don't give up yet as Williamson special can save you but it is DC's match to lose now.,3
Test match level swing,1
"Warner v/s Rabada hahaha.

Remember Rabada's 2nd innings spell against him @ Port Elizabeth?",3
Game. Set. Match. Rabada.,1
Mumbai are winning every single IPL from now. Mumbai in IPL gonna become the Ranji Mumbai of the past,3
Has been a really really bad day in general so this isn't surprising,2
That was a beautiful delivery,2
Oof that swing.,3
two slips? Why not a silly too?,1
Whoa that was some movement,2
Gotta see how Kane will respond after previous match's outpour of appreciation,6
The script writers made some last minute changes after that prediction Tweet went viral.,5
God damn what an inswinger by Rabada,2
This is what happens when people start thinking we are going to win,2
Omg the swing of the ball,2
"Well SRH, let's see what you're made of now. Chase something more than 140 w/o Warner to bail  you out.",5
That's the Ball. Over. Match. Season. Congratulations MI.,1
Rabada screamer after the wicket? Should get a 2 match ban for this.,2
Pandey match winner here,1
Late swing for Rabada today! It’s over!!,1
Look what they did to my Hyderabadi bois,3
Rabada you can shag my future wife,8
Congrats MI on the 5th title,3
"God that's a huge wicket. As much as I'd like a first DC win, I still feel for SRH",2
SRH: We have decided to choose 'hard as fuck to win' mode.,6
"I'm reading the Cricbuzz commentary, and they just said ""game over"". WTF!",9
"Bring in that guy cracking south african bowlers in knockouts joke. 

Take KG Rabada",6
Well congrats Rohit for his ~~4~~ 5th IPL trophy.,1
"Come on SRH fans, increase your reverse jinxing. That's the only thing that matters. /s",2
"Okay, time to go watch Liverpool v Man City.",3
I hope the camera keeps zooming in on Warner as SRH crumbles 😍,7
test cricket field? Damn,1
Inside part of Rabada's ball is made of rubber. Outside part is made of...,3
I have a feeling SRH is going to comeback.,2
"ootl, who is 3D?",1
Rabada is getting some juicy swing,2
"Steyn-esque, I daresay",2
Hopefully Rabada reaches 27 wickets and it's straightaway a fight between Bumrah and Rabada for Purple cap in the finals.,3
Mumbai jerking off right now,7
If they chase this wout Warner 🥺😢,3
alright game is not over yet. let's just wait and see,2
Rabada is so good till he plays against MI. They wipe the floor with him and everyone else on DC,6
"This IPL could have been something special to witness. No crowd noise, listening to infield chatter. 

These crowd noises are more or less fine, but the experience could have been much better without it.",3
It's over for SRH now.,3
was the ball swinging for SRH?,0
Goodbye SRH,1
Is that really how you pronounce Delhi? D'lli?,2
Pandey ji 3 years of unbreakable trust by SRH management despite so much criticism. Comon it's your time to repay them.,8
Bondawagon teams like SRH dont deserve finals.... MI v DC it is!!!!  ...would have liked KXip and KKR in playoff tho,-2
No MotM for Warner this season :(,3
The madlads at cricbuzz said match over,6
pandey tuk tuk incoming,1
Basically Warner is a bunny for a tall fast bowler who gets the ball to swing. How he made so many runs when Pakistan visited is a question Misbah amd Co shpuld ask themselves.,6
Beautiful outswingers.,3
Nortje next over please!,1
"""Chul bul"" Pandey or ""Bulbul"" Pandey today?",2
"As a MI fan, gotta say, this makes me happy lmao.

DC is the easier matchup than SRH.

Just hope DC decides to put Shaw back in the lineup for BBQ chicken wicket in the Finals.",14
Manish pandeys century today.. mark my words,3
pandey gonna do tuk tuk now,2
"I really hope Manish becomes a great finisher for India 

Still remember his 100 v Aus",7
Rabada the 145 kph leg spinner,10
Get the fuck away from Bumrah pls,7
"Manish ""leave the ball "" pandey",7
Damm warner 😭😭😭,8
Congratulations MI,1
Lol Rabada getting that swing is scary :|,7
My boi Rabada back in game!,6
"damn, Rabbada. That was amazing! New IPL champs incoming.",7
Now Kanos remains,7
"This is the ultimate long con from ponting and rabada never take a wicket in the powerplay.

And then take the wicket of warner in the semi final.",9
Every damn ball from Rabada is swinging a mile.,3
Why did these idiots keep the final on Tuesday,9
Damn! Bumrah’s 27 wickets really went under the radar!!,5
"Today nothing went SRH's way with misfields, catch drops and bad bowling. With Warner gone, the chances to win are slim. But SRH can be proud with the way they played this year. The last 4 matches were virtual knockouts and they showed great character to come this far.",12
No buttabomma,3
I want Rabada to win purple cap and Dhawan to win the orange cap,3
Bro I swear Nortje runs as Train goes on tracks,2
"Pitch so good for spinners, DC asking Rabada to bowl fast leg breaks",4
Rabada channelled THAT AUS vs SA series for that delivery against Warner. His celebration showed it.,2
Keema Pav is fielding in place of whom?,2
Rabada you BEAST,5
"Jesus what a ball that was

Swung late too",3
Yea please god new champions for once,9
Warner's wicket was shown for the 25th time now.,8
Will KKR 2014 Manish Pandey show up today?,5
I think this is curtains for SRH. Warner was the biggest key to this chase and DC picked it.,8
"""Oh Russell nahi Hustle"" - Shikhar Dhawan lmao",3
No hate on SRH but I wanna see a DC vs MI final.,2
"Hear me SRH bois , we got a great season inspite of the injuries and choke chases . Chin up lads",29
Why josh ad suck so badly ?,4
lol w the Zomato's ad tho,3
there goes my NNN,5
Zomato ad is pretty good ngl,8
That was smooth.,5
Lmao Manish wtf that was such a classy shot,4
Beautiful shot,4
I will fap to this shot.,3
I guess all srh fans will root for dc in the final,8
What a beauty by Rabada. He NEEDS to bowl fuller,2
"Both purple and orange cap holders will be decided in Final, what a season of IPL",3
Pandeyji is the only hope now!,3
Noice Pandey ji.,2
What a shot.,2
"Ffs pls no new champion this year

Come on SRH dont let DC get out of the meme team club",3
"Top shot from Pandey

He does turn up in big games - ipl final for KKR",2
Pants: creamed.,2
Pandey ji ke liye ek banda neeche rakh do yaar,6
Manish in da mood,5
Show them you are worth 11 Crores,8
It's Swinging boi,3
Mera kaat kaleja Dilli,0
In another episode of Great Comeback deliveries of Nortje,2
Manish looks like he's in the zone so far. Can he take SRH home today?,1
Pandey: Look at me. I'm the Warner now,4
KKR Manish coming back.,2
I expected Pandey to tuktuk why he goin all out,2
Bowl rabada out here,1
Yes! I am not losing hope yet. Pandey-Garg combo will shine today.,2
this match is 50 50 I'd say.,3
Final will be r/cricket vs MI and we all know how that goes,9

Garg can run? Thought he twisted his ankle.,4
I get fulfilled with shots like these,3
"These IPL pulse questions be like 

“Who’s a better six hitter Chahal or Bumrah”",10
"Priyam Garg be like ""I'm just happy to be here""",3
"All IPL ads: does something Cringe


CRED: Cringe, but self aware",9
Pandeyji cmon justify your t20 selection,3
Kkr Manish today?,3
Who tf even compares Rabada to an uncapped neckbeard? Quite insulting!,4
Smack the kid with a bouncer at the helmet,5
can we all agree that the HDFC ad is the worst,6
"SRH you have to win for us, We KKR Fans Are with you, Take My Energy",7
"Okay guys! Time to cancel Hotstar subscription & uninstall it.   


It was fun. See you next year!! 🤝🤝",9
"Nooo, we want the 60SR Manish, Not 150SR Manish",0
This is a good test for SRH and their warner dependency. Chances look slim but the game's far from over.,8
"""better"" yorker being the key here.

Natarajan is still young and needs to realise simply getting the length right is only half the job.",4
All over Hyderabad,1
"As an SRH fan, I am not disappointed by the score or our batting ability, but by the fielding we had. Dropped catchs, sloppy over throws easily cost us around 15-20 runs more today.   


Let's hope for the best, but either ways, I am proud.",16

Does any other top order batsman with 100+ IPL matches have a worse IPL career strike rate than Manish Pandey besides Parthiv Patel?,3
Is it just me who wants to see garg take on rabada.,4
Nice INTENT despite Warners dismissal,7
Nice shot boyyy,4
Man sunnyG spouts utter bs sometimes,9
Need a Wicket ASAP,4
Garg wonderful,2
Garg gonna do Bisla here?,5
Harsha never expected to be cheering on for fastbowlers turning up the pace? Really Harsha?,9
Match still can go either ways. Hold on guys,5
gonna go watch football..atleast one of my teams will win today,6
ponting looks forever pissed!!,6
Ohoho what a shot!,2
"Priyam ""Mr. 360"" Garg",7
I think Dhawan is one of the few players who has played accordingly to his potential.,8
"SRH needs to hang in, save your wicket in the good ball and hit the bad one",5
Thought it was a top edge but no he played it very well,8
GARGled it,8
Lol whenever the camera pans to Ponting his reaction is ALWAYS deadpan.,18
Who awakened Lord Garg?,7
pandey ji kinda cute tho,8
'Halla bol! Halla bol!',5
People close to Manish from Karnataka Ranji say whenever Pandey misfields he scores big. He did msifield today mind you!,7
Rabada has to bowl one more here!,6
"This is like the 2003 wc final, so much was riding on sachin and guess what happened",9
Did they cut the Kohli part from that Hero ad? LOL,9
"If the batting puts a fight up here, it'll be so good to see.",2
Wow Garg can play pace ... great news for him,6
Harsha's commentary has been subpar this season,9
We're winning this ain't we,3
"Losing the match defending 180 with Rabada and Nortje in your bowling lineup, now that's really something.",7
"Inb4 Garg 103(71)

Edit: never said it would be a winning score xD

Edit edit: well shit lmao",4
As good as a bowler Ash is equally shit he is as a fielder,7
It feels like Nortje gets a top edge go for six against him all the time lmao,2
"Mega or mini Auction, we seriously need few good Indian Middle order batsmen next season.",5
Manish protecting Garg against KG,7
murali karthik is the worst commentator this IPL,4
Nice to see Garg batting confindently like he played against CSK,5
Rabada should have purple cap so that mi win the cup,6
Pandeyji's calming effect on Young Garg,6
"Why is Priyam not on the flight to Australia, #FIXED ^(/s)",10
Bangar knows a thing or two about batting. Almost as if he's a batting coach for a national side or something?,8
"Now that this match is done and dusted,  it was actually a good season for us. The way we bounced back after that punjab Fiasco and thrashed the top three teams was the second best comeback of this season after kxips five record wins",19
"On a scale of Totally Unscripted to Fully scripted, where would you rate this IPL?",5
"Garg already has 2 sixes and Warner has none, Garg > Warner confirmed.",13
"Axar should get the next over, I'm sensing a wicket",4
"Why dont u SRH fans create a seperate sadness thread n cry about injuries there?? 

Why r u doing it here??  So suffocating n irritating",5
Watching Johnny Benchedstow sing the Killers was fun,4
"come on boys, make them choke on that south african dick",3
commentators having to say shit like *unacademy* cracking 6 or *cred* powerplay everytime is the worst of greedy capitalism.,4
Lmao Bangar mean to say Pandey doesn't move feet. Bro you were the batting captain for 3 yrs. That was the only job you had. Disgraceful 😭😂😂😭,8
Popular opinion is MI jersey is the worst. I nominate SRH. So bland,3
Remember how Yashaswi Jaiswal was supposed to be the rookie of the year?,4
Bro how bad is Ashwin in the field. That double on the first ball was way too easy,7
"Why hasn't RCB flairs disabled yet, mods?",4
This kid is getting so lucky,3
"Manish Pandey is an RCB season! Give hope, and take it away!",6
Ashwin should be in slip instead,6
Ethical chubby,8
GOAT ipl batsman ..still wouldn't pick him to chase 190,7
Bruh ashwin always jogging,20
Pandey was that intentional?,5
Ashwin channelling his inner Rohit lmao,4
"Ashwin is a liability in the national team. Change my mind

Edit: t20s and ODI's",3
Ashwin runs like my grandad,12
I fucking love watching Ashwin field. So casual.,20
"So many edges, need only one of them to go in someone's hands",6
Ashwin runs like he's holding in a nasty poop. Run freely bro!,10
ok that one scared me,5
Its all over Delhi we'll be back next year 😠🥺,6
Why would you place Ashwin there?,11
That SRH physio should be given a raise. Priyam was barely able to walk.,19
"Bowl Ash out quickly and get a fielder, he is struggling atm that injury is glaring",13
Ashwin : these motherfuckers keep hitting it to third man all over long....,19
"Did Bangar say ""Wide Pace"", or ""White Face"", or ""Wide Face"", or ""White Pace"" ?",6
What is Priyam Garg's favoured batting position?,8
DC always seem to be fielding with less fielders.,0
"These two looking comfy, match is going to be good",8
Ashwin is carrying a hamstring injury. Let us place him in the third man position.,10
"Why are SRH fans being so dramatic and talking about the match being over? The team is going at 9 an over with only one wicket down. Kane, Holder yet to come",6
My grandad runs faster than ashwin,5
I’m giving it 85/15 for Delhi to win with Warner out,6
I feel bad for Ashwin for having those injuries to his hamstring. From 2015 to early 2016 his off break was dipping and dropping on the batsman as he was able to use his body. Now he cant do that as much.,3
The only game where I legit felt like my heart was about to fail was India vs Bangladesh 2016 wt20,23
"""dukaan se"" lmao roflmao lol 😂🤣",1
Damn this Hero Xtreme bike ad is intense. So good,7
Axar Patel can bowl now if you want.,1
Ashwin is one of the worst fielders of all time,6
We should've scored 200,6
What the fuck was this Colgate ad,7
Fuck this is gonna be a close game,12
", Shreyas Iyer is  very confident and assertive for a guy who has not really achieved much in high stakes cricket",19
Stoin bowling has been unironically very good this season,9
Ashwin needs new Nike Reacts.,6
Let’s hope at least the finals is more entertaining. The qualifiers have been largely one-sided in this IPL,4
"Bangar's ""wide base"" sounded like ""white face"" or ""wide pace"" and all the combinations of white face, wide and pace.",2
"I'd pay to see a 200m sprint between Shane Watson, R Ashwin and Saurabh Tiwary.",22
my boy Pandeyji looks in touch,5
"Even if we lose today, at least we didn't get our asses kicked like the last few times.

That's heartening.",9
This match is going to be really close lol,1
Was there really a need for Marcus over?,2
Styris has his [SPONSOR] Awards confused,5
Pls dont give me hope pandeyji,2
Why stoinis over??,0
Pandey 2014 loading?,8
"Does no team besides MI and DC have a quality finisher?  
 
Maxwell is shit. ABD is forced to play a bit conservatively because RCB is always a batsmen short. DK hasn’t done very much since Nidahas. Dhoni isn’t the batsmen he once was. SRH, enough said. Stokes is being used as an opener rather than a finisher by RR.",11
They’re making it look really easy. Come on Delhi. Need 2 quick wickets.,3
I don’t want us to lose,0
I want srh to lose but I like Pandey being in form before the aus tour,0
Who is this Garg Guy?,2
What the fuck happened to Manish !,2
Bowl Axar you dumb fuck!,2
With Kane to follow srh can easily chase it down .,5
"Ok bois, we getting 1st Indian Centurian MPandey today.",8
"Dont bowl wides atleast, the extras can be avoided. 3 already in total",2
"What’s a player that you wish you saw more of in the IPL? 

For me it’ll always be KP. Severely underrated in IPL cuz his first season was a massive disappointment. His next season with RCB was an absolute treat to watch and he performed decently in most other seasons from what I remember. 

I just feel bad for Delhi handing him the captaincy and the fact that he was injured for half the IPLs when he was eligible",16
I love watching Pandey do well,10
"No one:

Dugout: ""Wide base""",3
"My stream froze on “he did a wonderful piece about his Feet-“

Please someone confirm the sentence did not end there",6
What’s the point of bowling stoinis in PP!!,6
🅱️oinis,4
STOIN WHAT A FUCKING GOD,3
There we go FUCK YEAH STOIN,3
The Incredible Hulk!,5
"Next bloke to play for India will be a genuine middle order batsman. And that’ll be Garg, not because he has scored heavily (he hasn’t), but because he looks the part.",3
Stoinis UWU,7
SRH chasing 190 without Warner will really be something if it happens,9
For the love of God Karthik shut the fuck up!!!,2
hulk mode,3
kya se kya ho gya😭,5
Ffs that ain’t good,4
Yo what the fuck was that Stoinis scream,7
Just when I thought we could win,8
Stoinis angry 😰,7
Got Rekt by the Stoin.,3
Hulk thank you!!,1
"The pitch is good. If Warner was still in, this would have a good match.",6
"On your bike, child",3
"Smacks Nokia

Yesssssssssssss Stoinis .... flex 'em guns.,3
Goon,1
Fuckkkk,2
Hulk mode,3
LET'S GO STOINISSSS,6

"bruh, it's stoinis' world and we're all side characters",9

😞,5
STOINIS MOTM,6
Fuck yeah boi.,5
There's your Cred power player right there ❤️,5
BIG DICK ENERGY ACTIVATED!!!!!!!,9
Garg has done his job tho.,6
STOIN STRIKES,11
Stoinis has been the MVP for DC,13
Damn he let the Hulk out there for a second and it was fucking scary man.,10
Delhi bar that wicket of Warner haven't used the seam movement in the pitch. Also they have slightly misread the surface picking 3 spinners.,0
"Stoinis, Bowling mate.",5
Now game is over,6
Omg that scream from Stoinis! The Hulk smash...,21
That smile from warner,1
Gargage innings,0
Might be a low score but Pag played really well.,8
Only kanos can save them now,6
Stoinis showing his frustrations in that scream lmao,5
Bishnoi and Stoinis are my favorites from this IPL,2
Stoinis turned partly green just now.... was he ever at Los Alamos ?,1
Wow. Good fucking ball,3
It appears we're making the finals this year,2
CHOKE ON THOSE BICEPSS STOINIS HATERS,7
Is this Garg's top score?,-1
[deleted],3
Garg you should not get out to Stoinis lad!,1
"**4.4** Stoinis to Garg, OUT, he has missed a full straight half-volley. Garg will be bitterly disappointed he has got out bowled to a nothing ball **43-2**

PK Garg  b Stoinis 17 (12b 0x4 2x6) SR: 141.66",1
"Every time Warner smiles, he basically tries to control his anger and frustration.",6
So that's why people call Stoinis the Hulk,3
Good job Garg now it's time for others,3
Warners fake smile,4
Now the fate of the universe (our season) lies with Kanos,5
Lmao they were right not to waste a review on Garg,3
The last of the recognized batsmen...,7
"Stoinis is having a stormer today.

No nut November ended early for Warney.",5
God you can really see how much dehli want this. Both rabada and stoinis look so passionate,5
rashid khan 100 tonight,5
Samad's day?,3
"So I guess it is looking like Team Blue vs Team Blue for the final. 

And lol @ Warner cheeky grin",3
It's massakali massakali mothersuckas,1
Kanos for the clutch again?,1
This is too much even for williamson.,3
"This is a dumpster fire situation for SRH, high target, 2 wickets already down.",2
Warner be like ***i have seen worse day than this***,2
Stoinis is pumped. They also played his gym song. No way DC losing this.,2
Need a 100 run partnership here,5
Fairplay award gaya tel lagaane. DC is out for thar final spot.,2
"Noice!!! 

Did Stoinis swallow the gum he was chewing?",3
Stoin channeling his inner hulk,4
These MFers are using the 'Barmy Army' chants from Ashes 2019 lol. They have just slightly lowered the volume of the chants.,5
1 more wicket and our tails open for Rabada to cleanup bois,7
Warner smiling to hide the tears,5
"Imagine hooking Nortje for a six over fine leg and getting bowled to a half volley from Stoinis. 

Such has been SRH's day",10
Would be fun when Rashid comes out to bat,3
Future csk captain (hopefully) is here,2
How valuable is Stoinis. Holy moly,5
Getting Major RPSG vs MI vibes this year lol,2
RCB died for this...,10
"Almost all next generation ""Future of Indian cricket"" batsmen have shown themselves to be average at best in this IPL",3
Somebody put the faceapp smile filter on Warner!,2
"Can't expect kanos to win us every match, oh well boys, twas a nice season",10
"Kanos: Fine, I'll do it myself.",6
Does every South African in r/cricket support DC?,4
Oh buy Hulk vs Thanos,7
"Bring out the Hulk, stoinis

Edit - fuck I called it",4
Stoinis making sure he gets RTM,8
Hope kanos posses the reality stone with power stone in his bat,8
R.I.P.,3
Warner is smiling bcos he knows Kanos is not gonna let down SRH.,6
OMFG STOINIS,7
What the fuck lol,4
goddamn stoinis,7
Stoinis calm down boi(just kidding),6
SRH chasing this total is equivalent to RCB winning the cup.,7
"Cricinfo- Garg would be dissappointed getting out to a nothing ball
Cricbuzz- Too good for the u-19 chap.
Hmm",9
Williamson holds his bat and sets up like a tennis player...,2
"Fuck yes, bye srh",3
Lovely collapse srh,1
"Ffs Pandey

That's probably game over",5
"JIYO STOINIS YOU’RE MY GOD

The smile on Warner face says it all. How the heck did we get this far.,4
"Repeated comment from 1st inning

Holder : I am the most effective all rounder of this ipl

Stoinis : Ye me kar leta hoon aap dream 11 pe team banao",8
"Tbh, this isn’t too bad of a wicket considering this gives Kane enough time to get set and then accelerate later.",3
SRH gifting the match to DC here.,5
Stoinis- fine I'll do it myself,3

Stoinis taking 2 wickets in the powerplay like we all predicted,10
Pandey is a complete moron,5
"Lol Pandey ji, why bro why",4
Yeah you don’t deserve to win shit if you get out to Stoinis.,1
"**4.6** Stoinis to Pandey, OUT, oh golden arm if ever there was one **44-3**

MK Pandey c Nortje b Stoinis 21 (14b 3x4 0x6) SR: 150.00",2
FUCKING HELL I LOVE YOU STOINIS,5
Go DC...this brings me so much pleasure,3
Stoinis the game changer from Match 1 to Qualifier 2 .,3
Ponting seems to have threatened the overseas players with bambu in tambu. Both Rabada and Stoinis are pumped.,2
"Why are we still here , just to suffer",5
pack up time for srh,1
Clutch Stoinis! Whattey playa !!,3
What type of shot was that.,2
No gay but I am ready to treat Stoin with a BJ,9
Stoinis the the mf god,3
Wish I don't have to see Manish play for Hyderabad anymore. Complete waste of 11cr lol,10
I don't think the final is gonna be as one sided as everyone is expecting it to be,16
Wtf,3
"Great, we get to see Mumbai beat the shit out of DC AGAIN in the final",9
Bye guys. I'm going to sleep,5
"RIP SRH. Had a great comeback, but one too many matches to win on the trot with Saha and 3d Shankar out",3
Gg,1
ZAMPA YOU BETTER GIVE SOME CUTE CUDDLES TODAY,12

Manish has a nack of throwing his wicket at wrong times,3

"Made Stoinis VC today, not disappointed at all!",7
Lol. Stoinis with his dibbly doblys doing it for us!!,3
Ah yeah it's over lmao.. stoinis somehow gets these wickets,6
Well pack the bags it's over even King Kane can't do much now.,2
"Well, there's only so many must-win matches you can win after all.",10
Fuck SRH falling apart,3
Man I'm glad Stoinis is on our side after seeing him pumped up like that,10
"Holy shit, look at stoinis's arms. Fuck me.",12
I wish India had an all-rounder like Stoinis. Dude is a workhorse for us,10
Gg,3
Imagine letting Stoinis take 2 of your wickets,8
Where is the guy who said he doesn't find Stoinis attractive again??,4
Sanjay Bangar taking the piss with 'consistent performer Manish Pandey',4
"Yeah, This SRH batting line up without Saha doesn't deserve a final anyway",5

I'm a simp for Stoinis's biceps,4
I fear stoinis gonna rupture his veins lol,3
Imagine losing two wickets to pie chucker Stoinis :(,4
Delhi doing a Mumbai-Indians on SRH,3
Stoinis popping his blood vessels.,3
Fuck you Pandey. Go for auction and fuck some other team next season.,1
Damn Stonis is fit,5
How do you lose 2 wickets to Aussie Rajat Bhatia? 😭,6
"Everytime Pandeyji, everytime you give me hope only to take it away",4
Stoinis over should have been a brainfade. It became masterstroke.,4
"Getting out is fine

But getting out to Stoinis is a crime",0
"OMG STOINIS!!! Power player of the match, game changer of the match, man of the match give him allllll",2
At least SRH can blame injuries for their loss,4
Why do some batsmen not have any situation awareness. You just lost a wicket,6
"Stoinis

Gold's gym New Delhi, premium member.",9
"It's all Rashid doing, he awaken the beast inside him",7
BULLSHIT BALLS AND ULTRA-BULLSHIT SHOTS,4
"If Kane manages to finish this game, he needs to be retained even if he charges 15 Cr.",11
Warney is going to go crazy in UAE today,3
"that's it, game over , just in time for the City Liverpool game too. 😁",3
That emotion that was mysteriously missing within the DC camp for the previous 6 or 7 games seems to have returned. They look like they actually care about what happens for the first time in a long while.,8
We dont want to see this good DC  in finals lol,2
Fuckin hell stoinis is about to burst,4
Stoin boi having revenge for not letting him meet his boi Zampa,2

Ok srh you had a good run,5

49?,3
MI v DC for the finals...,2
Shane Warne's dick must be dripping like a busted drain pipe today after seeing Stoinis.,5
Liverpool vs Man City time fam,5
Winning chasers for last match at crease,1
Williamson has to make 150 here to win now,4
Watch DC release Stoinis next year I swear if they do imma die,5
Oh SRH what have you become,2
I fear no batsman except **Kanos**,2
Chalo GG bois. We had a great run! Coming this far without Bhuvi and Saha is like a win for us. Se y'all in 6 months time,17
**Use stoinis in powerplay**,4
Holder at 5? SRH going all out now.,4
Wow SRH using up all their key batsmen back to back. Can't see why holder needs to be brought on before goswami.,5
"Jaldi kar Kane

Stoinis is Like the guy in gully cricket who will only bowl if you let him open the batting first,12

 I wonder if  Kohli ever wonders why almost every player who moves away from RCB excels when with a different franchise?,9

If I celebrated like Stoinis I would need a change of pants,6
FUCK ALL Y'ALL FOR SHITTING ON WARNIE FOR THIRST TRAPPIN ON STOIN,6
Last batting pair and last hope hanging by the thread for SRH in the form of Kanos & Holder who hits boulders,2
Did they forget they have Shreevata Goswami? Why is holder batting at no 5?,7
SRH has been exceptional this year.... with so many injuries they are going to be the third best team in the tournament... very happy with their performance.,3
can the boy from Tauranga carry SRH once again?,3
Delhi if you reach final please play like this in the final too. Don't.be 0-3 or something,10

I love this Holder guy! Wanna see him hit a big one today.,6
Does Williamson have it in him to strike above 150?,7
This must be the earliest Holder has come on  in his entire career,10
Kane can play his calculated 55*(40) tofay no problem,3
How much did Stoinis go for ?,0
SRH have lost the same number of wickets in the powerplay as DC did the while match.,5
dc either dominate like a king or look extremely powerless. They have a very big blind spot which is only exposed at the most crucial times. Let’s see what happens in the final.,7

"Given Axar and Dubey will operate in an over or two, I'd have preferred SRH to send Shreevats GOATswami. 

Also, to keep one experienced batsman back in the shed in the form of Holder. But let's see.",7
what did rashid say ?,8
Rashid now: shouldn't have said that. I shouldn't have said that,8
"Well done dc, proved you deserve the place

Please don't fuck up again against mi

Give them a good fight, all support from an rcb fan",8
"Gonna do some rage commenting like Doland:

Waiting for the mega auction.....Need to groom Indian batting contingent in SRH.

We've come so far...But can't rely on bowling and warner everytime.",8
Hit him in the dick?,6
Saw a lack of criticism for Stoinis for that celebration for a young player which is funny because Kohli & others always get lambasted by this sub,13
Imagine having such less hope in a 30 year old who has played for 12 years at domestic level that you bring him 4/5-down.,9
[deleted],23
Abdul Samad  100 incoming,0
This match is boring. I want to see Rashid the batsmen against Stoinis the bowler.,10
That Nortje's pacy yorker going to ratlle Holders stumps for sure... just a matter of time :(,7
Iron cock Holder,0
So the designated opener in Goswami will be coming in at 6 now? Doubt he'll be able to do anything at all outside the powerplay,6
"WE WON THIS POWERPLAY, BY A LOT!!!!",12
"I want srh to atleast give compitition now to DC, don't want Delhi to come in final fully pumped up",3
2 Coolest international captains have to play aggressive innings,12
"Man I just want Mumbai to lose, no csk either. Any other team winning is fine with me. 

Srh need to get Indian batting talent, tired of these bums getting entire season to bat but scoring 130 runs in 14 games.",4
"upvote if i should close the match and study, downvote if i should keep watching",6
DC now need to get Kanos out,0
How tall is Jason holder ? I think tallest amongst all cricketers.,4
"How tall is Holder, jeeeeez",8
Most economical bowler,3
The only reason he took those wickets was to show off his biceps,9
It's all turning and swinging,0
Picking Pandey and Iyer over SKY gets dumber and dumber every match. This match highlights the dumbness.,6
"Just tuning in, what happened between Rashid and Stoin?",4
Rashid' shouldn't have sledged the Greed God.,5
There is turn for Axar. This is fucked!,8
"Stoinis's form is great for Delhi but worrying for upcoming Australia tour (don't mind MI match, new winner would be fine too)",3
holder's not a no. 5 in any form of the game,4
This Rabada guy can definitely move around the ball. Wonder how he will perform in test cricket..,0
Kanos is cricket perfection,6
"This is where Priyam should bat, sad he was given to bat today in such a crunch match......

Happy we came to 3rd with all these bloody injuries to our main players!!!!!",6
Pant is a baby behind the stumps,12
Pant the cheerleader,8
Wasnt Holder part of a CSK squad?,5
Recency bias. Nattu is good but this is just recency bias,12
Who are these kids claiming that Nattu is better than Rabada,15
Pant chup hoja bhai please.,9
Pant is going to runout batsmen by screaming loudly,8
"Drop Pandey FFS! Enough is enough!

Retain Davey, Kane & Rashid

RTM for Sandeep Sharma, Bhuvi & Nattu",6
"Everything about Garg this season - his attitude, fielding, and his confidence about his batting - has been exceptional. This kid is a natural leader and is going a long way. I hope SRH retain him by looking at the long haul. He could be an absolute gun.",8
Can't wait to see DC lift the cup this Tuesday!,3
"Although DC is in good position now, bowling choices done by Iyer are very questionable imo..",4
Should just bowl at Holder's legs. He won't be able to reach down,7
How can a pitch change in between innings like this?,10
Even this guy is getting turn wtf,8
Well Natarajan can only bowl Yorkers well everything else gets smacked,1
"SRH: WE DID WIN THIS IPL, BY A LOT.",12
"Lmao love Pant and his ""Hyeeeaaaaaaa""",5
"Successful teams recorgnize and nurture talent.


Stoinis turning up at the right time in play offs

KL Rahul Orange cap holder.

QDK top scorer for MI.


All 3 released by Kohli not realising their potential.",10
They didn't ask more yorkers,2
Daily reminder that kxip released axar,9
"To make playoffs more exciting, each of the final 4 teams should be allowed to pick 1 player from the eliminated 4 teams.

For e.g. say RCB pick RR from the hat, they should be allowed to pick any player, be it Indian or Overseas. RCB could pick Archer to make themselves formidable!

DC say then pick KXIP from the hat and they could get in KL Rahul to fix their opening and so forth.",5
SRH in thala mode at least for next 5 overs.,17
Pitch is turning even for Axar and we got 3 spinners tonight. Everything's coming up DC tonight.,10
6 yorkers in the 20th over of a T20 match is mental,10
"SRH will a force to reckon with in 6 months with Bhuvi, Saha and 3D back in the team",22
"Commentator on mic : that unmistakable voice of Rishab Pant.

Thinking inside : *this chirpy little cunt*",39
Get the leggie to bowl. Good situation for him!,2
Inb4 big west indian fucks DC and thier chances,4
SRH players received payment from Ambani on time it seems.,2
C'mon SRH just play for the NRR,13
Come on DC win the trophy,4
Pant is one of those guys that doesn't let the bat do the talking for him,26
Ricky Ponting has put a spring in the ball. Thats why its moving so much.,15
"Jio^TM nanobots have done a great job in completely changing the pitch after DC's innings. 

Kudos to mota-bhai and his merry team of engineers!",17
Oh yes a new bowler to meme about or be praised,7
Rishabh Pant is worse than Kamran Akmal when it comes to behind the wicket banter.,8
Pant noise > crowd noise,24
Holder was watching a movie there. Need some popcorn?,6
[deleted],17
Please perform like this against MI. It could easily not be enough to win just because of how good MI are but do not make the final 1 sided.,11
I feel stoinis is in a different level altogether in the last 2 matches. Go stoinis.,5
That was not worth even 1% of an appeal lol,1
"Pant, just ""accidentally"" throw the ball at one of their hamstrings. Just end the match and put them out of their misery",-1
Pant is one annoying cunt,-3
Saha's injury is proving to be extremely costly for SRH,6
Warner realising he gets to go home early and make some tik toks and smiling,10
Can Pant's noises fire up a team like Kohli's?,1
Can't make lube jokes because name ends with Y,1
Pant should come with a mute button.,1
Chahar or Paddikal who's your emerging player of the tournament?,-1
"*SRH knocks RCB out (with Zampa in the playing XI)*

Stoinis: ... and I took that personally.",43
"If Muth-raj Gaikwad wins 'Emerging Player of the Season', imma lose my shit.",5
"Indian fans, Bishnoi is the future. Invest invest invest!",4
Will Mitch marsh play ahead of Holder in next ipl as the other 3 are fix.,0
why are srh tuktuk-ing,7
"You're being listened to whether you want it or not. Is that unsettling, or reassuring?",17
Holder can't play spin,1
They need to start taking risks now.,1
Come on hit few boundaries. You're not chasing 130 this time,6
Stoinis is so fucking jacked. Makes me want to hit the gym even harder,19
Where's the next IPL going to be? Same location or in India somewhere?,2
If this DC shows up against MI it’s going to be an amazing game. Hope we can finally lift the trophy.,5
I think this is the happiest I've seen Stoinis in any franchise besides Melbourne Stars,7
"Dubey has done pretty well so far, even in his first game he did decently",1
[deleted],6
So clearly rcb was capable of a turnaround too. That makes me feel good,-1
Dubey > Dube already,0
They couldn't play Lamichane so they bought someone like him,2
Do these SRH batsmen know that NRR doesn't matter now?,7
"I can't stop imagining RCB with 4 foreigners

1.ABD 2.Stoinis 3.Morris 4.Hetmyer 

RCB shouldn't have released them :(",10
Dubey looks quite promising..,2
This Dubey already looking better than the one at RCB,4
Good over by Dubya,2
Rahane shud be the MOTM for not playing even a single dot in batting n not giving even a single run away in bowling.,11
When you get owned in both the batting and bowling Powerplay by Stoinis.,7
Is this Dubey's first game?,5
All depends on kane today ..sounds familiar?,5
"Please don't shit on me but this is not a Kane Williamson kinda chase, but then again he's Kane Williamson.",18
Koach's sledge against pandey worked for delhi,2
Warner smiling 24x7 must surely be superstition right?,12
"SRH fans, are you for MI or DC in the final?",1
Really bowled over by Gabbar this ipl. I didn't want him anywhere near the T20I team but he's in red hot form!!,4
Pressure building up on SRH. Expecting a wicket here.,2
Pant tries too fucking hard.,2
"Kane bro, the target ain't 140..",4
"Looks like GG.

Hope you win against MI, DC.",6
If Kane gets out this chase is done.,0
Why are people getting mad at Pant? It's literally a part of his job to annoy the shit out of the batsman so they commit a mistake,20
Dadddy Williamson💦,5
Pant doing a thala,6
Holder wicket soon,0
Dhawan under Ponting is another kind of beast,6
Axar needs to go here. Can't play him out. Atleast 10 RPO.,2
Who gonna bat after this?,2
Where is Saha today? Him and Warner looked so deadly against Mumbai the other day,7
"Huh, so DC had an opener in Stoinis bit didn't use him till today.",9
Warner with that wry smile on the outside. I can feel his anger within though. Would not be surprised if he spanks some SRH players today.,9
"Choker Virat must learn something from Daddy Kane.

# #RohitArmy #Rohitians4Lyf",-13
Everyone knows mumbai indians is too strong even csk fans will accept it,2
[deleted],8
In form Kohli + Dhoni that actually works = Kane Williamson,3
If Holder wins this for us then that should directly take him into his national T20 squad. I don't think he's a part of WI T20 team.,6
"Axar is 26, still cant believe this. Almost feels like he has been here since forever",13
Delhi should always bat first because they are not used to this stage of the tournament so they will falter in most chases.,5
"Axar deserve another chance in Team India, he's just 27",6
This is a good point by brought up by dugout commentary.  Fatigue could be a factor too.,8
[deleted],21
"If some batsman in world cricket decides to turn around and whack Pant's face with the bat....I will understand. I will not approve his actions, but I will understand,",21
it's kinda gloomy seeing srh like this,3
"Disappointing that none of the uncapped Indian batsmen clicked for us - Garg, Samad, Abhishek Sharma

Although they're still kids",13
Srh batting looks dead inside,2
"Axar is underrated, but he was in 2015 WC squad",7
Holder looks sketchy,4
Swann vs Third umpire has been the rivalry of the season.,20
Commentators calling Axar Patel underrated  continuously throughout the season has made him the most overrated underrated player just like Gambhir's final 97 in 2011 WC,26
Both these guys are so slow between the wickets,11
They will check this a million times.,3
What's even more sad is that I'm going to be rooting for DC in the finals and they're going to be steamrolled by MI just to add to my disappointment this season,14
"Should have taken it immediately, absolute timewaste",2
It did touch the cushion right?,7
Pravin Dubey has such a look that his ex gf comes from Hyderabad lol,11
Holder playing a test innings.,3
Srh back to form,1
i think kane went to LORD TEWATIA academy OF UNBELIVABLE CHASES,8
[deleted],9
Kanos to win it for srh. Calling it now,11
"SRH has no pinch-hitters, right? This game is done. Congrats, DC. 

^(Unless Kane & Holder do the greatest IPL chase )",7
RR is still too low. Have to hit 2 boundaries in a over.,7
Some batsmen just have to get all them funky shots out of their system in the nets. Holder is at his best playing conventional shots.,3
Gonna invest in some shares coz Shikhar Dhawan told me too!,18
Iyer's impression of Stoinis  [https://twitter.com/ESPNcricinfo/status/1325420394724077569](https://twitter.com/ESPNcricinfo/status/1325420394724077569),5
Whom we are projectimg to win here?,2
Surprised to see Delhi not choking. The AQI is 450+ today!,4
No prize for guessing today's MOTM,1
If only Rcb scored 10 15 runs more,4
"With all the online talk show hosting, I'm guessing, Ashwin is not finding time to hit the gym.  He's already such a poor athlete, bulking into a deep fried vada is not going to help him in the field.",6
hope MI win the finals,6
"Kane can only win you 150-160 games, not 180-200 games. That's why he isn't rated as higher as Warner or even Kohli.",12
If manish palyed like how kane and holder are playing everyone would've shat on him all week long,4
I don't want any of the ipl comebacks. Dc might lose the final so win this match well. Hopefully carry that confidence to the next match,2
DC approaching final? 2020 restoring..,5
"This is basically like Q1

Kanos and holder will play like stoin and axar, make their owners jump a bit

Then proceed to lose by 50 runs",8
"Idk why India dropped the idea of Rahul at 4. He was supposed to bat at 4 in the World Cup before Dhawan was injured, then it seems like everyone forgot about that completely, and for some weird reason Pant was pushed at No.4 for a long time. Then Shreyas did a good enough job to hold his spot. KL Rahul is definitely a better batsman than Iyer and should be batting at 4.",6
Wtf third umpire didnt spend way too long asking for about 384895 different angles to decide on a boundary? I cant believe it,11
Dc vs Mumbai who will win ?,7
Hope DC make MI atleast fight for the win in finals,5
just play 4 more overs without loosing wickets and cross 150 and look respectable!,3
"MI will always chase and DC will want to bat first after this. So no matter what, it’s DC batting first if they go on to win this.",7
"You guys are so nice.
I feel like I'm sitting in a cafe watching match together with all of your discussions..!",12
"If you give enough money even a dead donkey will wake up and ask ""kya plan hain.""",6
If DC beat mi in the finals it's gonna be the biggest plot twist ever! I'll laugh my ass off,4
Delhi is best when we bat first. No pressure to chase a total so I'm hoping we win the toss on Tuesday and choose to bat. We MAY eek out a win if so.,5
My boy Dhawan deserves to on the winning side today. Already an anomaly with an Indian top order batsman scoring so many runs.,6
"I loved Kanos but this sub is slowly changing my love into hatred. 

Kanos is a great player, pleasing to eyes. But not a god. So plz stop comparing him to others n showing other minor or weak.",20
"I don’t expect to win, but atleast get to a respectable total pls",10
All this to fuck it up against MI,15
[deleted],11
What is it with Warner's perpetual smile?,7
"If they cant get Kanos in the next 3-4 overs, DC is done for.",0
Nortje and Stoinis are my new favourite foreign players.,6
Kane anna....like Ganna,2
DC got this much in PP,2
The fielding is turning out to be the difference,2
"Harsha saying David bhai, Kane anna lol",6
Kanos to take it to the deep\^TM?,4
Why is poor Johnny sat so far behind in the dugout?,4
"People thinking final will be easy ride from MI ,if Delhi wins lol this is ipl and not cpl , here all teams  are equally strong , and delhi has strong players, I mean their entire xi are capped internationals barring pravin this match",4
Kano what a BOSS!💦,7
I live for YJBs shit eating grin,9
Warner is all smiles today because his mustache grew up to its full potential.,7
Probably an unpopular opinion but we need to let go off Manish Pandey. He has played in every match and given an all important no. 3 slot but he hardly ever delivers. May be he wins us one match per season but a rookie like Garg also did that. No need to pay Pandey 11 cr. We can free the purse at least and buy other players.,20
That's why they need to get rid of kanos,7
"SunnG going for the kill with ""mujhe pata hai kisko nahi dunga""",3
Why is Ishan Kishan not considered for Emerging Player award? He fits every single criteria!,8
Dc gonna be major underdogs against Mumbai,14
"What's the point of playing tuk tuk cricket, it's not like NRR matters.",5
Warner's got the smile of a man who's about to be reunited with his wife's biryani.... or whatever the equivalent of that is in Australia.,5
God damn sunny g just murdered a kid.,1
"r/cricket  
Kane with 100 SR: **You gorgeous, come here**  
Iyer with 100 SR: **You fucking donkey**",20
I really want to hate stoinis but I don't think I can,8
"WARNER: Smiling

POINTING: Back to worrying.",23
SRH always had a non-existent middle order. It was warner and their bowling that carried them here.,16
They doing Maxwell dirty even now in dugout lmao.,7
"Why the fuck wouldn't you give stoinis another over after he takes 2 wickets, shit captaincy",10
Kanos always puts up a good fight,3
Bring Rabada in and put more pressure!,4
"Two Right hand batsman in, so Ashwin is dead to this team.",9
Holder looking all at sea against the spinners,1
Get Kanos wicket I'm worried,3
I think Delhi will be happy even if they lose against MI in the final. They will see it as massive progress.,11
"Ashwin where are you, mankad Kane plz",18
Warner's being creepy and Swann's weirding me out.,17
Even Australians shitting on maxi lmfaooo,9
Why Bairstow is not playing?,2
I don’t understand Iyer sometimes. Should’ve bowled Stoinis after Nortje. Given him another over after the excellent first over.,4
"If Kane and Holder clutch it from here, MI will have a great challenger",10
Anyone got an UlluTV and Fliz movies subscription that I can borrow?,-8
Why Praveen Dubey looks so angry while bowling!!!,5
How long before the Supreme Court finds some loophole in the way these Dream 11s have circumvented the rules and bans them?,15
It's a waste of a Rabada over unless he gets a wicket.,6
Fuck it's Rabada again. Don't let him take a wicket boys!,3
Lol imagine comparing Iyer and Williamson. One dude knows exactly what he is doing and another dude is captain of a team for some reason.,15
I think SRH missed a trick here by not playing Bairstow. He could have provided that powerplay boost.,4
Look at these lovely deliveries.,2
DJ playing some Bollywood nostalgia,2
Man idk what to watch City vs Pool or this game. Two interesting contests,2

Need to play off this over bois.,3
In b4 Kanos gets his abdomen guard signed by another South African pacer.,7
Rabada's getting some crazy swing and seam movement today.,7
Where's golden arm boi Stoinis?,6
This IPL has been so close because all teams (barring MI) have been exposed of their vulnerabilities again and again.,8
Are spinners going to bowl at death now? Even 17 rpo won't be enough then.,1
kane's great in other scenarios but chasing two a ball for ten overs?,1
Scenes if Ashwin goes for 60 runs in 4 overs.,0
"If we win this game, I am gonna cry man. 12 years a fan and we finally make the final. Do your thing 2020.",7
"South african vs Kiwi in a knockout game

What a SHOT by Daddy love machine Kane Williamson💦💦💦,2
Kanos has been cucked by Rabada here.,1
Lol,2
2 captain kool,5
Kanos still believes.,7
fuckin hell!,9
Shot,6
Delhi has so many lefties that Right handed batsmen have become southpaws,7
Hope we reach 100 before tea,9
Kanos what a shot !!,9
Okay so we’re still not safe unless this guy gets out. Axar pls.,5
"We usually get to see this kind of battles in Test matches.

Why isn’t Saha opening anymore?,-1
"Yeah don’t ever compare Willamson to Iyer like ever. This dude is another level, maybe another 2 or 3 levels.",11
"Yes Iyer has been making some poor decisions but ffs he is just 2 seasons into captaining full time and guess what the team has been in the playoffs both the times. His batting has been hurting yes, but he has captained us pretty well. He is still so young, what are you expecting?",16
8 runs off a dangerous over.  Noice.,6
"Go DC, be free of the meme team burden. RCB and RCB B bless you",14
such conviction in a shot though,7
Wouldn't put it past Kanos to play an innings for the ages tonight.,7
These two are going to sneak up to the target and then blast off like MSD. I'm not ready to lose NNN,1
"120 in the last 10 overs is impossibe. DC wins.   
See you on Tuesday Delhi.",6
What happened to ashwin?,3
What the fuck was that from Williamson?,5
Muyrali Karthik forgot he was cunted by Gayle when he was part of PWI.,6
So Kanos was actually saving Holder from getting out to Rabada?,10
why did they remove the song from that OPPO ad? feels awkward now,2
Going to be MI 4 - DC 0 this season,5
"Probably off topic. Echoing the same sentiments as others, the Kane circlejerk is definitely extremely annoying to me atleast. Anything he does invites 10s of the same comments with Kanos this Kanos that. Any discussion around him turns into elevating him to a godly status with how underrated he is. Even fucking ICC posted his picture inviting people to salivate to his smile. He's honestly become the Keanu of this subreddit. He's my favourite player and people are free to do whatever they want though. So whatever.",7
"Players like Williamson feel so safe to look at the field, it just feels wrong if they get out",7
Ashwin needs to mankad Kanos now,4
This new Whitehatjr ad is even more cancerous than the last one.,9
"Neither Kanos nor Holder can really go crazy given there's no one left after them that can carry a 190 chase.

Can't blame them.",6
Hot take : stoinis's overs will be very crucial,5
"Until kane is there match is on
If srh wins this then they are deserving for the ipl 
If they win this 5 in a row right ?",2
Why do KF make such sucky ads!,2

For the guy asking for the difference between kanos and Iyer. Watch.,14
Pure Magical Madness,2
Kanos murdering DC's chances,3
Kanos big daddy love machine,2
Holy shit if Kanos pulls this off...,3
The 'Banker' is at it.,2
Williamson gonna win it for SRH.,1
Kanos has no choice but to go after Axar like that,1

Don't give us hope kanos....,1

Holder couldn't hold it.,3
"Finally, a wicket, but Kanos still out there.",3
I knew it. Holder never looked comfortable against spin.,8
Should SRH consider retaining kanos over Warner,5
why stoinis not given another over,2
Nothing shot by holder,5
What shitty tactics by holder.,4
Delhi needs to get Williamson soon.,1
Come on Dehli Capitals! Lets see if this Sunrisers middle order can carry the weight of this chase that Warner has been shouldering all season.,2
Terrible shot from Holder,2
Send Rashid in. Let him smack a few.,3
Match done. Too much for kanos alone to chase this,6
Alright just kane left,2
"Bring it home kane, I have my nuts clenched",3
Kane might be too good for dc but they van sure take the other batsmen out.,8

Why is pant so quiet today?,6
Goswami at 7? Complete waste of a spot,8

"If i have to make an ipl team, Williamson and bumrah are my first two picks ...them being nice guys helps.",11
Hold-erred.,4
The match is never over till Williamson gets out. He is just amazing in chases.,8
SRH batsmen only need to hold at the other end while Kanos is on the pitch and still there's a good chance,3
I'm ready for Deandra Dottin and Sophie Ecclestone tomorrow,5
"**11.4** Patel to Holder, OUT, smart bowling from Axar. The thing with Holder's charge as against Williamson's is, he comes down early, and Axar fires it in and follows him too. Takes his arms out of the shot. And is caught at deep midwicket **90-4**

JO Holder c Dubey b Patel 11 (15b 1x4 0x6) SR: 73.33",2
That's some shot,9
What a shot,6

Samad just hit at least 2 four 2 sixes before getting out and your job would be done.,10
Bhai Williamson Ambani se baat krte hai. Bhut paise h apne paas. MI:s new signie in the mega auction,2
Bye bye Holder! Let's see this batting line-up crumble under the weight of this total.,8
Thank god for Hotstar.  I can pause and skip all the ads. I don't know how people can watch IPL on television. I would lose interest if I have to endure this many ads.,8

"Abdul Samad has to fire today. Otherwise, this will be one of the worst performances across a season frankly. Jadhav has been worse but Samad is close.",6
I remember Samad having a bit of a tonk in his first game or so. Would like to see of that today to make this a game,7
what if this samad dude pull a Hooda and shatter us,9
Still not worried about Kane's batting yet. Its a very big mountain to climb and Kane cannot climb it without any Sherpas.,5

Give one over to Ashwin before giving up on him at least?,0
"Win or lose, Kane is such an elegant player to watch",4

Unbelievably chutiya captaincy to not give an over to Ashwin.,2
Brain fade Samad,0
You feel DC are still 20 runs short due to those last 2 overs.,1
Why tf is Ashwin not bowling? They really broke his confidence by bowling him the first over.,5

Damaging both my hamstrings for Kanos,5
You know things have not gone well when you cant remember any of his knock but his phrase- EASYEASYEASY,14
Kanos: fine I'll do it myself,5
Pant's infantile screaming put Samad off,10
Kane Williamson is what RR think Steve Smith is for them,21

Like there is a mid season transfer.

Wouldn't it be rather fun if teams who are knocked out of the season get to loan some players, to teams who stay in the competition.

One 6 now pls Kane,1
Even Kanos is looking a bit agitated now,7

Looks like he is",4
Well done Jesus.,5

Just need to bring the equation to 40 off 20 and hope the South African duo to choke themselves,6

Just need one wicket. Bowl Rabada or Ashwin.,7
When you can bowl such good Yorkers why would you bowl those short ones!!!!,9
"Batsmen hits Nortje for a boundary

Nortje: _You have won a free yorker_",11
SRH don't give me hope and rip my heart  out after time out.,5
Stoinis can bowl decently well in death but it would be tough against these guys,3
Kanos has his own script,2
[deleted],3
Gotta get Kane out or it's over for us,3
"I hope hindi commentators stfu. This is the last recognized pair and they literally need 12 runs every over, Samad has to hit it out and try to score ~15 runs every over.",6
"Samad struggled bit time vs slower balls before, nice to see him improve this game",5
Wicket in next over or SRH to play final,6
Lmfao we're going to lose this,7
This match is gone now. Spinners will still have to bowl 2 overs minimum now and no target will be too big then.,1
Ashwin kahan hain bc????,2
Nokia bamboozling Kane and getting tonked by some unknown kid,6
Big man Samad,2
Another over like that and its SRH's game to lose.,6
Kanos hain toh mumkin hain.,9
Samad is long due. Hoping he takes it home.,4
"Williamson angry

Samad and Garg: Shit shit shit shit shit shit. *Hits boundaries",8
Lord Nokia joining Dinda academy anytime soon ?,5
"Glimpses of talent with Garg and Samad  as always. Irrespective of how this goes, I'm happy that they will only get better next season.",12
If samad can pull out hardick kind of innings.....,3
I like what Lara is wearing today.,1
"Losing out on the 200 might bite us in the ass. As Koach says, we may be 10-15 runs short. 
I’m scared.",3
"Absolute lack of self awareness from Corky describing 140k as not being fast enough.

Fucker couldn't hit 130k on his best day.",4
I ain't watching the match as I don't wanna Jinx it,1
Rabada has only one left. They need 1-2 overs of spin. DC is fucked 😁,1
Oh I’m in danger..,1
Game gone I feel. Two more proper batsmen to come. Kane with 60 already. Dew. Rabada nortje with one each only.,0
Why fear when Kanos is here. SRH 2020 🏆,2
Ashwin was our best bowler last match and here he isn't being bowled..,2
"chill DC folks, RRR is still 12",3
Finally chance for Samad to perform where SRH has backed him consistently this season.,5
This is very gettable for SRH if these two keep going. One over from Rabada and Anrich to come. Can target Stoinis or Dubey or Ashwin.,2
"""It's the hope that kills you."" both SRH and DC fans",4
"Dugout Guru is just too easy for Lara.  
Reads the game easy. I'd to pay to watch him and Sachin analyze the game together on a comms panel",9
Kanos was going strong and now samad's looking good too. Will be hell of a win if they manage it,2
"When you can bowl yorkers like those, why the fuck do you have to experiment",2
[deleted],8
Don't know why Nortje going for wide length in spite of having skill to bowl such amazing yorkers..,3
It hurts more when they give you hope first. :/,1
I hope samad smashes mankad,2
Stumps gonna get wrecked soon,2
That Nattu final over might just come back to bite DC in the ass..,2
Fml,1
Finally we remember we have Ashwin lol.,0
One team dependant on South Africans while other on Kanos. We know which one chokes in a semifinal and which one on final,5
Rashid can slog. He's got a bit of Afrdi in him,7
"not gunning for 200+ may come back to bite DC's ass here, we ve seen this happen when gabbar hit that first 100 at like 140 sr and the team scored only 160",1
Just take single s and give strike to kanos please,2
Terrible rotation of bowlers by Iyer. Why has Ashwin only bowled one over?,3
Ashwin coming in now is peak incompetent captaincy/planning,5
"Fuck me, you can’t lose this BC.",8
I'm getting vibes that Samad is either gonna murder Ashwin this over or Ashwin does a mankad,4
***TAKE WICKETS!***,7
Bruh if we somehow clinch this... Can't even imagine,3
Whoa where was he hiding all match?,2
We're here just to see who chokes in the last 5 overs.,2
Remember when cotrell went for 30 and next played a game later,2
Ashwin vs srh,0
This has to be a clutch spell by Ashwin. This is the game right here.,2
Letzoooo ash,0
Ashwin at the death. Let's see how this goes,1
[deleted],3
Mankad please it’s the only way we can win.,2
This is not a good match up. Ash is way too experienced for Samad.,6
Samad being the bipul sharma of 2016 Q2,4
Ashwin gonna win this for DC,2
Keeping 3 overs of spin for death overs 😂,6
Ash winning the match for sure in this over. Could be for any team though,2
Samad is just batting so fucking well,2
Last over should have been Ashwin,1
"Nice recovery Doull, very cool",3
Too short.,1
59 in 29. Idk but I'm still hopeful,7
This is not impossible tbh.,1
"If SRH have to win, one of the Indian guys have to do it. Kane kan't do this.",3
What shit is ashwin bowling?,7
What the fuck is Ashwin is bowling?,6
Ppl in UAE just lost the beIN connect stream. I'm so mad,2
Gotta go past Qualifier 2 for once,6
Ashwin is literally the only guy who i can trust against Kane,2
"Ashwin always posts about CSK on his YouTube channel, very rarely about his current franchise. Seems like he wants to go back.",8
Lot of rubbish in that over from Nortje.,2
This man Kane never disappoints 😭💯❤️,5
Fastest bowler Samad played before IPL was Prasidh Krishna but he is playing Nortje like he has been doing this all his life.,9
Ooff Gote was in mouth,1
Ashwin gonna fire everything in,2
This bowling is trash.,3
Crazy that dc gave up boult.,2
Nice wrist work Samad. This guy is good,3
Bowl to the field man,3
Ashwin was crying lmao,2
"Players like Samad, Hardick are very hard to find for a team",5
Wow! brought Ashwin way too early.,3
Nice Bois cool Bois,1
I want somebody to find me the way Williamson finds gaps,4
Pant and screaming ash ash is inevitable,3
Ethical short balls,2
Warner today 🙂,7
Wtf.. idiots bowl at the stumps and not so wide..,3
Ponting death stare intensifies.,2
Samad will finish this himself.,1
SRH pls pls win this,1
"DC should be worrying now. Our two best batsmen are still to come, Goswami and YRKFA.",6
"Delhi fans: finally an easy win 


Delhi: not so soon, Bc",12
SRH are cruising as long as Kanos is there tbh,2
Welcome SRH to the finals. We will have a legendary match.,7
Classic Kano!!,3
"Good character development from samad already. Last couple times we have seen him, he seems to have gotten carried away after hitting boundaries",8
"Well if DC has been consistent in one thing this season, it is braindead captaincy.",5
im feeling fear again,5
Anyone who thought the match was won by DC (Including me) should apologise,5
What the fuck is Ashwin bowling?? Too short and carrom only,1
Kanos OP,1
Who thought kane will play like this.... We getting sad over Warner's dismissal,2
Pressure is getting to dc bowlers ..srh needs to just stick it together.,1
Get the wicket of William son of a gun.,7
Delhi you need a better captain.,5
Ashwin is too brittle. He just keeps getting some part of his body screwed,5
Ashwin is going through one of those too clever by half phases where he thinks he is a leggie.,3
It's the dew,1
I Kanos we trust.,3
Problem with Ashwin is he uses way too much brian for a simple game.,6
"Wait, Ashwin only bowlers 1 over?. Iyer captaincy is on another shit level.LMAO.",4
Good spirit shown by Hyderabad.,1
Already 7 runs this over. No pressure 👏,2
Wow! Thats way outside - whats he doing?,3
In Okoye voice (about Ashwin): Why was he up there all this time?,4
[deleted],6
"Iyer: ""I'm in danger""",7
That was a wide. oops,5
Ashwin clearly injured,2
If kanos stays SRH winning,10
Williamson should have opened.,1
Shithouse bowling,1
wide kyu ched rha hai bc.,3
Dogshit bowling. Fuck.,3
Warner laughs during the match cz he knows the script.,18
Kane respects Samad now,14
Just mankade him at this point,10
Terrible bowling from Ashwin. No one on off side boundary and he is bowling wides. FFS,3
Get them out goddamn it,9
Ashwin's lost the plot,6
I want SRH to win just for Williamson,21
The fact that people have hope tells you how good kanos is,21
Swann hates Ashwin,7
Good over given the circumstances,13
Ashwin bowling everything except off spin.,11
Ashwin keeps telling on his shows that he strongly believes bad balls have better chance of getting wickets than good balls. I'm pretty sure he is intentionally bowling those pies.,24
Lol just noticed that DC dropped Shaw today. How do people feel about that? 😂,14
Punter’s gonna murder someone in the dugout(how he looks in every match though),22
Mr. Ethics chucking widish balls,4
Why didn't they bowl Ashwin earlier?,1
"With Ashwin back in play, it can be anyone game, I say DC 70-30",6
Dc hit 50 off last four we need 51,10
hope the timeout curse doesn't get to SRH,5
just one more big over Daddy💦,7
"I'm worried about players next, Goswami and Rashid",11
"Swanny ripping into Ashwin.


NICE  !",5
Hate to say this but SrH has the upper hand now.. Rabada should bowl the next one and get one of these out..,4
delhi has such bizarre field placements,2
Rahane didn't contribute but I bet he jinxed Delhi for not giving him a bat.,0
Can Rabada bowl a good over at the death?,1
This mometum breaking timeout sucks for batting team,5
So it’s two strategic timeouts per innings ? One per team ?,0
"If DC loose it from here, then Iyer has to be accountable for his innings.",5
"Delhi manages to get it close always, they always find a way",3
Ponting bringing his full squad on to the field 😎😎,6
I hate these timeouts. Robs all the momentum,6
Am I wrong in assuming Kane struggles a bit against pace?,3
We are bowling utter crap lol.,4
I'll simp kane for life,4
"I don't care if we win, this is all I want. Great fight from the team.",9
Couple of boundaries and it's SRH's game.,2
DC: *chuckles* I’m in danger.,3
"Let's not shit on Ash, he gave 10 runs which is fine given the circumstances",9
"If we lose this, it'll be because we lack a big finisher. If we win this, we have found our big finisher.",21
Tune in to watch and it's a timeout smh,5
Bowl some dot balls and slow them down,3
"and this match gets interesting, we have a game on boys",5
Only we can lose this. And we've managed to.,3
Still feel it's Delhi's game. They just need one good over and the game is done.,3
Ethical Mind : it is not ethical to bring in a spinner this late. So now I'll bowl medium pacer's slow wide balls.,11
That’s why he’s only bowled the one over. Get him off the field. No need to bowl and his fielding is a negative.,2
"Ashwin to bowl the 20th??

Or give stoinis 1",3
Ashwin goes back to the carrom ball whenever he's pelted,4
Scotty asking for more memes Lol,4
"The less overs remain with these two batsmen still batting,  more in favour of SRH this game will lean",1
DC winning this. 50 from 4 is Tuff,4
Dugout wants memes about them lol,1
Next over has to be Rabada but we will see Stoinis.,0
ashwin was bowled to mankad kane,4
"Man, can't help but be a bit disappointed. Just needed someone to stick it out with Kane, the equation would've been a lot more manageable right now. Extremely long shot to beging with now and one bad over makes it basically impossible",6
This is getting tense lads...,1
"Brain fade captaincy from Iyer, only two overs of pace left in last 5 overs",7
Can SRH keep kanos forcibly even if he wants to leave?,1
Scary Situation for DC,2
If Kano pulls this off here...,4
Take a bow kane Williamson.,2
"Send Styris memes lol, he wants to see em",3
I genuinely cannot watch the old commentary after switching to dugout,4
Switches City vs Liverpool as it's half time IPL now I will take strategic time-out,3
I thought we were gonna fold for 120 like Delhi did to Mumbai.. team is showing great fight.. Good going guys.,12
super over anyone?,3
Peeling an orange let's see what happens,2
DC bowlers are panicking themselves out of the final,4
Can we for once reach the Final,2
Don't think srh is gonna win here. And I'm sad. :((,4
Dugout guys wants some memes on them,7
Wtf is an anti virus fan?,9
Hold your shit together Delhi.,3
Will Dhawan not taking the drs come back to haunt em ? Find out in the next episode of dragon ball Z,8
Greame Swann >>>> Ashwin,3
"I am praying to Cricket Gods for a superover. 


Kane is a Kiwi so I am 99% sure my prayers will be heard.",8
"only batsmen i have seen consisently cunt Bumrah is williamson, MI shoudnt take the final lightly. its going to be a highly competetive game, if SRH make it to the finals",5
Punter's gonna use his spring wala bat on Iyer's ass post match.,3
Surprisingly Goswami isn't here yet.,1
Reminder that folks were comparing Williamson to Iyer lol.,6
Nasser Hussain joining the Dugout?,2
Dugout asking us to tweet memes. Our meme game is falling short boys.,3
Get a huddle in and get it together ffs,1
It's still DC's match to Loose.,2
Man Kanos should have played all the games this season,2
Ponting Iyer ki maar raha bc,0
Arnab Goswami in the dugout lol 😂,6
Dugout talking about Arnab Goswami,6
"DC fans here are the worst. When the players have good performances, they praise them as if they're infallible. When they shit the bed occasionally, they shit on them the most.",5
If SRH Wins today. They win IPL.,8
Wtf,3
Brain Lara please call wicket alert,3
"Thrilling. SRH have an edge rn, but a single wicket would totally shift the momentum to DC immediately",3
Bruh scotty just had to bring that up lol,5
Arnab in Dugout 😁,4
Oh Stoinis is here. Game over,2
Is Ashwin picked in any of the India squad to Australia?,1
"Nortje
Stoinis
Rabada
Stoinis will bowl now",2
Lol Arnab talk on the Dugout. Legends these guys.,4
"Can you set up a reminder on reddit ? 

Wanna tune in tomorrow",1
They talking about Arnab Goswami? 😂😂😂😂,4
DC for once in your life win Qualifier 2 goddamn it,3
"Qualifier was one sided, eliminator and qualifier 2 are close. Have a feeling finals will be one sided.",1
Kane seems so random in that royal stag ad. But happy for him earning that sweet money with endorsements,2
Scott Styris Talking about Arnab Goswami 😂😂😂,5
Rahane staring at Ponting while eating banana 💀,6
Did they almost have a conversation about Arnab Goswami in dugout lmao,9
Can people not assume everyone watches the dugout here?,7
Lmao dugout talking about arnab hahahaha.,11
This can be the defining over for either teams.,2
Rashid said Samad and Garg's sixes make his look so small,4
Don't give 20th to Stoinis please,1
Why is Styris talking about Arnab Goswami?,9
Iyer should lose his fing captaincy,0
How the Fuck do Dugout people know about Arnab Goswami hahaha,6
Lmao Putin and Arnab Goswami mentioned in dugout,4
Wil SunnyG jinx Samad?,4
Dugout getting cheeky with right-wing politics!,4
Kane is too good... I'm getting really scared now.,6
"Haha, Styris pleading people to make memes on them.",8
Stoinis to go for 24,4
"Samad be hitting DC like they abrogated 370

oh wait",22
Why not bring on Rabada to try and kill the game right now?,4
Don't stoinis no,3
This where we lose it. An aggressive team would bowl Rabada here but we will bowl Stoinis.,4
"Arnab goswami jokes in the dugout lmao "" what happened to him""

"" I haven't been infoemed""",7
"Jesus Christ these Dugout people know everything, Making Arnab Goswami jokes",7
Imagine pointing has rcb coach. Whom will players fear more Koach or coach?,3
How the fuck does Styris know about Arnab lmao,9
Lol Styris saying 'I am not touching that shit' when topic of Arnab Goswami has come,7
Swanny is high. Thinks Goswami is in prison when he's padded up.,8
"Swann is sweet about it but he genuinely didnt like Nasser back in the day.  
I used to read a column he used to write in a mag called All Out Cricket before he got RE-selected in the England team.  
  
He often felt like his fun loving nature was....misunderstood by the coach and captain in his first run when he MUCH younger(and putting 2 and 2 together i think the first captain was Nasser)",7
"If Williamson gets close to that hundred mark today, SRH are winning this.",12
"I think India should invest in Samad. Given his age and firing power, he could be a better, more consistent version of yusuf pathan if trained well.",13
I am scared shitless,3
Captaincy has been below par from Iyer.,1
"HOLY FUCK 


SCOTT STYRIS: "" REMEMBER THE FIRST DUGOUT DRBATE MODERATOR ARNAB GOSWAMI?""



SWANNY: "" WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?""




STYRIS: "" I DONT KNOW *CHUCKLES* """,55
Samad is about to become a sensation.,4
What did I hear Arnab's name called in the Dugout ?,4
Walk in the park for SRH looking at the bowlers left and DC's nerves.,4
We're losing this,2
"Bowl Rabada, take it down to the wire.",1
Come on stoinis I believe in ya,1
[removed],5
"Hate Warner , dig Williamson 


Love SRH (still hate Warner) , low-key want Dehli to how through


Love Williamson, want to see him get out.


Ahhhhhh!!! The IPL is not for the fainted heart lol.",2
"Who is that stunning lady wearing a white shirt, in the Delhi dugout?",3
Good decision to take the pace off the ball,1
So I am getting 5MBps+ speed while downloading but Hotstar unable to properly stream even at medium quality -_-,3
"Styris: Aww, look at all these nice fans tweeting their support for the Dugout. You know what I've NOT seen enough of on Twitter, are memes about the Dugout

r/cricket: I've waited my whole life for this...",5
Pls no politics in cricket,-3
Lol Arnab got remembered....,5
Does anyone know that song in the H&M ad (HotStar)?,2
Rabada you beauty priceless save,3
Thank you Rabada.,2
[removed],7
"Oh boy sunny came back, its a bad omen for srh",6
Can we watch dugout on hotstar,1
Make or break for DC. They need to get either of them or else they are going to run away with the match,1
"If we lose this today, the sole reason will be fielding.",6
Producer must've shut them up 😂😂,5
"wow they making mobile phone jokes on nortje

  
big mobile man

can they RING  them home",8
DAMN YOU RRRRRRABADAAAA,8
Great effort by Rabada in the deep,5
Fielding has been the difference so far,7
Wait why are they talking about Arnab? Reading comments so unaware of the context.,7
"Guys, give it to me straight. How the fuck are we still in this when Warner got out second over?",11
You have to target Stoinis to win this game,4
That would've been a 4 if SRH was fielding,9
Need two more overs like that one against Nortje to even stand a chance,4
Arnab was the host for one of their dugout debates from previous years. After he had shat on the IPL for being corrupt and seedy. Man has no morals. Was ready to take the IPL money when they called him to moderate.,20
1 for Nortje and 1 for Rabada so 2 overs from Stoinis.Looks interesting!,4
"Sunrisers fielded in the morning? Sunny G, age has caught up with you.",14
Fuck these injuries.,6
Abbe yaar ab kya hua,4
Great Match for a semis,7
"Dugout >> any other commentators , top tier shit",31
Oh fuck Iyer injured noooooo :(,7
lol Swanny,3
Delhi school of bottling?,2

Lmao Iyer injured just by throwing ball hahaha,-8
"Iyer out is a win, Shaw is better lol. Iyer is more subtly shit.",-11
Please Iyer noooo we need you for Aus tour :(,10
Wtf happened to Iyer? Hope he is fine,6
Injured Premiere League,7
Shrevats Goswami:- specialist keeper 😎,10
"Please go out, we need Rahane captain. Thanks!",0
He threw with his right hand lol how is his left shoulder injured,3
Reading the comments it seems like Kane is on 100 from 30 or something lol. He's playing really well today guys but ease-up with the circlejerking lol.,-3
Ponting should come as a substitute for Iyer.,3
Is it an act from iyer?,2
Can we ever get over kane Williamson?,3
Guys. Just because there's a player named Goswami coming in next doesn't mean you can openly discuss Arnab in this thread. Let's focus on the game please,8
Dhawan gonna captain now or what,2
[deleted],3
[deleted],12
Threw ball using right hand.. left hand got injured.. ponting conspiracy to pull him out and give rahane a run,11
"Operation biceps lmao, if I had Stoinis’ body I would bounce my pecs after every wicket",11
Wtf man,3
Kane Williamson is the reason I'm rooting for SRH,9
Go off the field if you’re not fit instead of being a liability,2
How the fuck did Iyer injure his left shoulder by throwing the ball with his right arm?,3
**If SRH fielded better then....**,6
What a GOD-level sexy DICK FOUR,8

Would you wear Kane's sweat soaked jersey if he took it off rn?,2
Where are the yorkers?,1

"Comrades help, at this rate I'll fail NNN",7

OMG. Kanos now toying with the field now,3
Rahane badly wanting to take over captaincy to remain relevant lol,3
"This Iyer's niggling injury might delay his career path from taking that permanent No. 4 in Indian ODI team and eventually Test team at 5.

Some times small things like these make or break a career especially when there is so much competition to get into Indian 11 (or 15).",3

"Stoinis, you beauty. Is this game over for SRH?",1
Stoinis' celbration tho,1
**YAAAASSSSSS**,1
Bicep man good,5
"Guys who will win?



Jacqueline in her Josh ad showing her cleavage Vs me who is struggling with NNN",13
Stoinis easy motm. Delhis man of the fucking season,11
😭😭😭😭😭😭,2
Will never understand how stoinis takes wickets consistently,4
Maybe ya'all forget our best finisher — Rashid Khan.,4
"Guess it's Stoinis' day

No need to play that shot from Williamson tbh

Was prob a wide if he left it",6
Noooooooo,3
Why,3
Fuck. It's over.,3
Congrats DC,3
[deleted],5
"Wasn't needed, it was a wide anyway",4
STOINIS MAN OF THE FUCKING MATCH,9
Rabada next over please!!,7
And.... SRH out of the tournament. (Most probably),5
Well kanos it was fun.,4
Is this the match?,1
Now here everyone cried,1
Gg,1
**KANEDULKAR SANDSTORM ENDS.**,8
Great innings kanos! Probably his last for SRH,3
Difficult to win now,2
That's game for srh,4
There is only one God and his name is STOINIS,9
"Operation bicep? Lmao

WP Kanos!",6
Why did saint Williamson die,4
Bowl Rabada next over and not Nokia plz,2
"lol

feel bad for SRH

and mumbais going to fucking lose the finals now

no way we beat the same team 4 times

just not going to happen",2
Rashid can hit a couple of big shots,4
Come on DC we need the final in our life. Do it for the fans.,4
"Well played Kanos, this is already a win in my book",8
Rashid vs stoinis lessgoo,10
Oh no! Well batted.,11
I would give anything to suck off Stoinis's sweaty underwear from tonight.,-3
The disrespect for goswami!!!!,8
Stoinis punishing SRH for preventing his reunion with Zampa 😠😠,26
MARCUS STOINIS YOU FUCKING BEAUTY!!!,3
Game up to Abdul Russell,8
"Huge wickets, stoinis is having a great day",4
"Holy fucking shit, Stoinis is pumped!",7
Marcus Stoinis erupting with joy is such a beautiful sight. Incredible human being.,10
Gowswami went from being the opener to 8 lmao,5
"I wanna see Stoinis vs Rashid contest now. 

It's payback time.",3
Stoinis one man army,2
Congratulations Mumbai Indians,9
Stoinis vs Rashid again,3
"That would have been a wide if he missed it, jeez",3
Those SRH owner gang doesn't even have the decency to stand up and clap for a great Williamson innings.,7
Great game boys. We got close,5
"For once south African didn't choke....
Kane u beauty",4
Is goswami going to bat on the flight back home,6
Stoinis: Stonks,2
Kane 😭,2
"Ponting comes into the field

Ponting: Bitch we need a wicket

Ponting leaves the field",32
Whelp. I shouldn't have to cry as a neutral.,5
"Goswami.. like Rahane..
Drop your pads..",1
Lmao its just one of those Days for stoinis...So Congrats MI for 5th title...this one of those days is gonna kick your real rivals out😪,1
Want SRH to win now coz of that Kane masterclass,4
"They dont trust Goswami with the bat at all  
Rash ahead of him",5
Iyer - DELHI SE H BENC**D,3
Goswami 30(12) incoming.,3
"A batting partnership to save my life:

Kumar Sangakkara
Kane Williamson.",10
"Damn they crossed, we were so close to Rashid vs Stoinis",7
Well played Kane!!!,6
Love you and thank you Kanos. It has been a good run. We'll see you in next season.,14
"Stoinis to Rashid :O

edit: nvm hes non-striker",5
[deleted],47
"Rashid can still belt 20, he has the capability, don't get complacent here",6
Imagine people saying that Kanos doesn't belong to t20 cricket,10
Honestly I feel SRH will give tough competition to MI than DC.,9
FINAL BOSS: Mumbai Indians,5
Lmao Rashid is in. Goswami you 🍩,10
Why is Rashid coming ahead of a proper batsman in Goswami?,6
Ethical mind's theory about shit balls having a greater probability of getting wickets in T20 cricket is being conclusively proved right by Stoinis,10
Captain Kane (￣ー￣)ゞ,4
Brilliant innings by Linus Tech Tips.,10
Shrevats Goswami:- specialist keeper😎,8
Can Samad pull off a Tewatia?,9
There it is sunny g shitting the bed,3
"If the next over is not Rabada, I don’t know what I am gonna do lol.",3
Has Shreevats Goswami gone back home?,7
Stoinis bowling shit and getting wickets,1
Gotta defend,2
Williamson <3,3
Aight gg wp,1
Come on seriously?! A full toss and you knock it to the ground for a single,6
Why woud chase wide ball only to slice it man ?,3
"Any match looks tight

Me: *anyone in for a super over*",5
Lord rashid will win it for kanos,3
"Hitting a full toss for a single, wtf. 

Hardik would have sent it back to India",9
Stoinis is the allrounder which Watson dreams of being.,3
Goswami’s there just to keep.,2
"I met Kane Williamson 5 days ago. I got roped into watching my 3 month old niece while my brother got his hair cut. So there I am, sitting in the waiting area of a barbershop with my niece, and who walks in but Kanos himself. I was nervous as shit, and just kept looking at him as he was sitting there with his phone and waited, but was too scared to say anything to him. Pretty soon my niece started crying, and I’m trying to quiet her down because I didn’t want her to bother Kane, but she wouldn’t stop. Pretty soon he gets up and walks over. He started running his hands through her hair and asked what was wrong. I replied that she was probably hungry or something. So Kane put down his phone, picked up my niece and lifted his shirt. He breast fed her right there in the middle of the barbershop. Chill guy, really nice about it.",11
Anybody remember Rashid khan vs kkr 2018?,7
I think Rashid fucked up by pumping Stoinis up.,5
Imagine if they had retained Stoinis at RCB. Zampa and him would have had fun on the field as well as outside 😍,6
Pain,4
If only Pandey didn't play that brain dead shot,1
The shot from Pandey was the dumbest of all.,2
goswami specialist keeper,4
"Called it, lmao. Rashid ahead of Goswami",2
The golden rule of T20 cricket: *shit gets wickets*,1
Is Goswami SRH's Kedhar ?,3
DC fielding has been tight no unnecessary two give.,1
Sun Riders Hyderabad.,2
"Let's say Stoinis were to continue his form and came up for auctions , how much would he go for ?",2
They really threw my boy Goswami under the bus.,7
Shreevats Goswami playing as a specialist keeper lol,6
Stoinis is having best day of his IPL career,1
No Ashwin here plzzzzz,6
Hope someone pulls a tewatia here,3
"DC will get their ass handed to them by MI. Congratulations on your 5th title, MI!",0
"Samad can still definitely get them over the line, he’s striking at 200 and Rashid can also swing the bat if required, DC gotta keep attacking",5
Rummy circle ki maa ki chut,5
GUNS TAXES AND STOINIS GETTING WICKET ON BULLSHIT BALLS,3
Kane Williamson. What a player. I bet every franchise would die to have him in their team,14
"Gg DC. I'll support you in finals. Well done SRH, we've managed to come till here even with three of our main players injured.",7
Poor Goswami,7
"Brilliant game Kane, Stoinis you absolute beast",4
DC whatever you do just don't let this slip,5
"These incessant ads really break any immersion in the match for me, just far too many, seems like an American sport rather than a British one",2
Delhi should bring Rabada now and finish it quickly,1
Notout,2
Why Ashwin,2
Give Stoinis one over and Rabada the other two,3
"Come on SRH finish this, would be one of the most brilliant chases ever",10
"I’m calling it right now, Dc gonna steal a win against Mumbai",5
Oh man What's the point of having Shrivats!,5
Specialist death bowler Ashwin,4
"Goswami crying in the dressing room., This cruel from Warner tbh",3
Spinner now? What kind of fuckery is this?,3
Why Ashwin.. this should have been rabada..,3
Modi better restore Kashmir's 4G internet if Samad manages to snatch a win.,9
Can MI beat DC for the 4th time? Gonna be a cracking contest.,3
SRH believe in Rashid a lot,2
Bruh Warner could've kept wickets if they thought Goswami was this useless with the bat,13
Ok Rashid show ashwin why you are the best spinnee,4
DC's game to lose now,2
The umpires literally stand there to show tv sign,7
Dabba fellow Stoinis couldn't play one match like this when he was in RCB.,8
They are filling Goswami with rage so that he can blast off when he comes out to bat. Next they will send in Natrajan.,6
Swanney shitting on the umpires yet again lol,3
I'm sure as fuck Ponting told Iyer to bowl Stoinis next. Iyer would've brought Rabada.,6
Ashwin bottle this..,4
So Goswami is specialist wicket keeper? Haven't seen that in IPL in long time.,4
"""The ball kissing the helmet"" third umpire is on",3
It's cool to give Ash overs now but don't you fucking dare to do the same in finals against Polly or Hardik,4
"Saha instead of Goswami there and SrH would have been favorites.

DC should see this through.",6
The stability Kane gives to his side is unmatchable.,9
So nortje is not gonna bowl?,1
Ethical Mind vs Genghis Khan,7
I blame all you fucks with the *lAsT tImE XYZ hApPeNeD sRh wOn* posts,8
Okay so you won’t bowl Ashwin to right handers but will bowl him now. Why?,1
This over is going for 20,2
Fuck yes Ashwin just a mankad here and I'll be done,4
"A huge gamble right now, giving Ashwin the ball.",2
[deleted],-1
Ashwin bowling leg spin,1
500iq captaincy by Iyer,6
How is Stoinis so f’ing good in the IPL but so shitty for Australia??,3
Why no Rabada?,4
Young Rashid What a lad!!,3
Kanos is worth his weight in Gold.,1
Look I'm not a two time WC winning captain like Punter but Ash?,6
"If it wasn't enough that you are third choice wk in your team, Rashid Khan bats above you",8
Rashid slogging,4
Rashid can be dangerous,2
Will MI get fourth time lucky? Having the confidence of beating them three times comprehensively will make them complacent? DC can also play with the freedom of having nothing to lose.,3
Rashid doing his thing.,5
RASH id,2
If there was Hardik Pandya maybe but not sure if Abdul Samad can do it.,3
Memewin gonna cry,3
Watch the next one go straight up,2
Mankad for the win bois,5
Leaving Goswami to deliver the coup de grace with a last ball six,3
Tonked,1
"Felt like Srh would give a tougher fight to MI than DC. Stoinis has to fire on the final as an opener, if he gets out early on to one of the B's then it will be advantage Mumbai.",3
Bruh not him too come on just let us win comfortably.,7
Why would you bring a spinner in 18?,8
One more Rashid pls,3
Rashid goes bang!,3
So the key to success is play a season for RCB and get sold next seasom.,12
Such a retarded decision to bowl Ashwin over Rabada or Nortje..,5
In entire IPL career Kane has higher SR than Kohli.,3
Rashid tonking ashwin,2
Retarded captaincy,2
Khaaaaaaaan!,2
"Why is everyone shitting on Ashwin!? Oh, I get it now",3
YRKFA doing his part,2
Arey benchodo yaha se bhi haroge?,5
Young blood!!! Rashid What a playaa,5
Cmon rashid,4
Chutiya captaincy BC.. why the fuck won't you bowl rabada now..,6
Ethical spanking.,4
Hahahahaha come on Rashid. Smile and give us some strength,10
Oh damn oh damn,5
Anyone getting Afridi vs Ashwin Asia Cup 2014 vibes here?,6
"Rashid said : I couldn't do it with the ball, imma do it with the bat",9
Love the intent even if we loose this,5
The Rabada over becomes all crucial now.,4
Oh my god,2
Could it happen?SRH😳,3
YRKFA in the house,3
Yrkfa you Beauty,1
Iyer what have you done,1
"Atleast we haven't given up, summarizes our campaign very well",8
Great idea to bowl Ashwin in the 17th over— said not a single soul ever,2
Iyer masterclass,3
Rashid isn't taking an ethical or unethical shit,4
"Ethical mind hasn't had a good day.

He never does when he goes full Einstein and decides off spin is beneath him.",4
"Why did they need to bowl Ashwin here? Stoinis, Nortje and Rabada have an over each.",2
Bruh wtf is this IYER ?,3
"Such a dumbass decision by, Stoinis had one left",5
Why a spinner,2
"Instead of Ashwin, it should’ve been Nortje",1
"As I said, Rashid is a belter. Don't get complacent",5
ANDRE RASHID IN DA HOUSE.,8
Super over would be nice,5
just 1 more SIX dadddy💦,8
Rashid is still angry.,7
I like this new SRH chick,5
Ashwin a specialist yorker bowler,11
[deleted],-24
Our favourite leg spinning child is now hitting huge sixes,7
do you guys remember the cute owner of the old deccan charges team?,9
Delhi is trying its best to lose lmao,9
Oh! Great last ball.,1
"""Rashid match ko CPR dete rahenge""
        
                              -Aakash Chopra",24
"Virat: I'm the dumbest captain this IPL.

Iyer: **Are you sure about that?**",25
"Absolute brainfade from Iyer, bowling spinner at this time",7
Pretty well played,3
Want to see a repeat of Rashid vs Stoinis next over but unlikely since Nortje and Rabada have an over left each.,7
Ashwin Yorker specialist,8
"Iyer to his team: Guys, this is getting too comfortable for us lets make it SPICY!!!!",7
"Plz save Rabada over for 20th now, don't fuck this up",2
"Harsha holding his weapon tight, with every run scored by SRH. Pungi tight.",2
Bad captaincy to give Ashwin the over. Stoinis should've been bowled out considering his figures.,3
Didn't understood this decision but didn't costed that much,1
Rashid and Axar both are so underrated batsman.,9
Bring in Rabada and have him bowl 4 yorkers at least,5
SRH chick,3
Yorker! Incredible,2
Rashid Khan generally plays few amazing cameos every season. We haven't  seen one this year. What a time if he can do it today.,5
Rashid keeping this game interesting,5
Super over? 🤭,4
With nokia and Rabada there is no way,7
Get Rabada in first bc,3
So close yet so far. GGs Delhi,8
Good comeback by Ashwin this over. This next over has to be bowled by Rabada...,4
Oh yeah it's slogging time,3
Not a bad over in the end considering how dangerous it is to bowl a spinner as late as 18th over. Good come back by Ash.,8
Bring Stoinis in to get Rashid’s wicket pls,5
If SRH had fielded better they already would've won ffs,3
Fair play ki mkc bc just win the fucking game,2
Say what u want those last 2 balls by Ash were great. One 6 doesnt magicaly win SRH the game,7
Iyer is the dumbest captain and it’s not even close lol.,1
The last two balls were brilliant but Ethical mind shouldn't bowl a 4th over.,6
Rashid bro this ain't Rambo 3,3
Why do they show the ball speed for only 1 sec like it's sort of some coupon code?,8
Everyone should just aim to tonk now . Saha is there if they get caught,2
Who is gonna hit atleast 4 sixes in 12 balls for srh,5
20 run over incoming?,1
Don't let this slip,1
"Bit of trivia time: anyone know which player has the highest strike rate in IPL history?

Edit: Russell is correct! (Probably)",3
Atleast this qualifier match was interesting,6
"Swanny ekdm chutiya hai kya!

Kisi ko bhi kabhi bhi favourite bol deta..",-1
Man the scenes if SRH somehow manages to steal this win,4
Kedar Jadhav is the only ex RCB player who hasn't made RCB management wish they hadn't sold him.,7
"15 or more, I think Nokia can defend it",1
Inb4 Samad smacks Rabada,1
Hoping for the Protea duo to choke,2
"If we lose, I'll cry. If we qualify, I'll still cry because it's the first time we qualify for the finals.",3
Massive two overs upcoming,2
If only we fielded better ...,2
"Good over in hindsight but why dc so such things , Rabada and Norte should had been option,",3
Iyer is mentally retarded. CMV.,5
Ashwin will get all the shit when its clearly iyer's fault,3
SRH's fielding cost them this match. Nothing else,5
Is Iyer ok?,2
Iyer:I somehow won today lol,5
Would you give Nortje or Stoinis the 20th?,5
Dc,2
I am not sure whom I am supporting.  When SRH are on top I am worried for DC and when DC are on top I am worried for SRH,5
Spinning yorker fro mAshwin.,2
Srh should be proud. Not only in this match but throughout the tournament they reached this far with little contribution from Warner.,2
No ball?,2
Is Altroz a glorified Tata Indica?,1
Guys ive been trying the whole season. Can someone please tell me the name of the cute girl in the cred ad?,1
Anything less than 10 runs this over and this should be DC's game comfortably. Big big over.,2
It gone mileeeeeeeeee. Biggest six in this match,7
Goswami injured?,2
ngl I'm kinda happy about this SRH fightback since it means DC doesn't go into the final being super confident,8
behenchod,2
SIX by young lad!! Ooffff What a knock under pressure,4
Its all over,1
Rabada. 2 full tosses. You sleepy man?,3
Wtf Rabada? You had one job!,0
Wtf are you bowling,1
No pls no what are these full tosses rabada,7
Wow what a game..,3
10 or so runs short i think,3
SAMAD YOU SEXY BASTARD,5
"If Abdul wins this, he'll become a cult hero",1
All those dropped catches and misfields coming back to bite SRH in the ass,1
Rabada bro why,1
That full toss looked high ngl,2
SRH FIELDING LOST THEM THE MATCH REPEAT AFTER ME,1
Come on rabada u are a Yorker specialist what's up with these full tosses,2
Pure trash by rabada,1

B E A U T I F U L,1

This is why MI will easily win against DC in the final.,3

Rabada just yorkersss,3
DC is losing the plot here...,2

Delhi are just going to surrender to Bombay if they make the final. We need you to make it so that the final is at least watchable and competitive.",9

freehit freehit freehit!,4
I don't think we're winning this,2
30 off 2 with Rabada no chance,3
Rabada has always been shit at the death,5
Bayliss never looks happy,3
That was a fucking no ball. Fuck.,10
This is the game,2
Finally they ended my misery.,5
Warner should walk onto the pitch,15
Woohoo,3
"FUCK YEAH, WE ARE WINNING NOW(I think)",6
Well time to say our goodbyes to srh,8
No Iyer there. Keemo Paul takes an excellent catch.,5
Noooooooo Bumrah,7
Thank fucking god finally.,5
Yasssssssss. GG rabada,3
no ball check?!,10
Warner wtf are you smiling about,11
YOUNG ABDUL SAMAD FROM KASHMIR,9
SG: and in situation like this you look back and think..... well this is your car. (fuck this shit),5
2 teams who just refuse to take the outright win.,7
They should check the Noball what the FUCK. Shit umpiring,3
"Oh fuck, atleast drop one. We dropped so many :(",13
That was a no-ball or not?,5
Thala would have stormed the umpires for no ball,11
That should have been a freehit. Bad luck for Samad,15
Samad tried,13
Chad Rabada,3
Was that a no ball?,4
Who's the SRH girl ?😳,9
GO YOU CRAZY BASTARDS GO,3
ass unclenched,5
Samad would have won it for srh,4
KEEMO FEED ME YOUR 12 INCHER,4
"So if dc wins they’re gonna blame the no ball, nice",4
Wtf is Warner grinning for ?,4
"Davey still smiling somehow. Feel for you champ, too many ups and downs in the match today.",11
Warner smiling,2
Please Yorker please!!!!,1
Thanks Paul 🥺😢😢🥺😢🥺😢😢😢,6
Turns out you can't just smash Rabada for a 6 every ball,0
The last ball was a no ball and this should have been a free hit.,1
IF WE DIDNT COUNT ALL THE ILLEGAL MISFIELD SRH WOULD HAVE WON BIGLY,12
No ball?,1
This could've been a free hit.,9
Why wasn't the previous ball called no ball?,8
Do delhi deserve to be in finals ?,3
"This was also a hittable ball, just got lucky therr",5
Good innings Samad bro,5
Was it a no?,5
If a spinner gets hit for 12 in the 18th over. I think that's more than reasonable from the bowler.,4
KG YOU BEAST!!!! Best in the business.,4
Goswami in finally lol.,11
Shrivats Anna will win this for us. Good night.,1
Feels bad for Samad but he is one for the future. GG,9
Where the tharki sony cameraman when you need him! 😒,8
Is there dew?,2
"didn't expect DC to have an interesting game, but damn this is such a good one",3
Strangely no replay of the potential no-ball from Rabada...,13
Somehow Warner is always smiling. Crazy,4
Keemo Paul looks built like a mma champ,4
motherfuckers ipl didn't give a no-ball in any of our games for high full toss,10
Where is Thala when you need him?,7
What's with Warner smiling every time they lose a wicket,6
Ashwin was sent in to get rid of Samad because he was loving the pace.,4
Sunny G also simps to Altroz,7
"I know we all tend to obsess on results , but just want to emphasize on what a great game we have had. No matter who wins, I hope it’s us.",6
Come on! It should have been free hit ball.,10
So shit umpiring is gonna cost someone a game again this IPL,11
Send in goswami,4
SRH have been screwed. And they aren't showing the replay.,8
Samad you have great career ahead.,3
Anyone know why tf warners smiling? He's been grinning all day,7
Its over..,1
Wow,1
H A T   T R I C K,1
"Got to say, that was a fine knock from Samad.",4
FUCK YESSSS,2
Is Warner being paid extra to smile throughout SRH's demise,6
Rabada Purple Cap holder again,2
RIP,1
This is the match,1
Alright rabada finishing it up sorry I doubted u for those full tosses,1
Rashid had no choice.,2
SunnyG paid off the umpires to make us lose /s,8
I'm sad,4
Why they don't even show replay,8
Rabada on a hat-trick?,6
Lol rabada on hat-trick,6
We died trying... thats all that matters now,15
Samad's innings > Kane's innings.,-1
Gn srh gg,4
Dilli hype bc 😍😍😍😍✔️,2
It looks like a replay of csk vs SRH match,4
Rip,2
"Warner smiling makes me uncomfortable at this point
 
He is intentionally doing that to have an image of a new man after the sandpaper debacle or is this genuine? Does not feel real to me.",4
South Africans are chokers my surprisingly hairy ass.,4
Love u Rabada. Now collect that trophy in final DC,1
"Someone said earlier Samad will play a good hand but for a losing cause, please share time machine codes.",8
Keemo looks like a black Hollywood actor from the 80s,4
Rabada did a Kabada again,3
Goswami...plz👉👈,4
Don't give him wickets SRH,4
Ducking rabada won’t bowl like this against MI.. and give away 50 runs .. asshole,9
No replay of a no ball. What a joke of a league,16
"**18.3** Rabada to Abdul Samad, OUT, Keemo Paul takes the catch at long-off. After missing two yorkers, Rabada gets one nearly right. And because it is straight, it has given Samad no room to swing his arms. He toe-ends it to long-off, and Paul takes the catch to his left **167-6**

Abdul Samad c sub (KMA Paul) b Rabada 33 (16b 2x4 2x6) SR: 206.25",4
Rabada saving this match,3
Rabada giveth Rabada taketh,6
Well played samad. You have done more than what was expected of you,14
MI probably the happiest at this result.,10
Scenes if Goswami hits 6 sixes.,10

Lmao everyrhing in the slot,7
Time's difficult for goswami's rn,2
KABADA,1
I so wish Rabada gave rashid the send off he gives,7
Great game boys,5
"Never forget, we lost it with terrible fielding effort",11
Hattrick 🥺😢,5
Good game dc. Good effort srh,11
Rabada you magnificent genius,12
Rabada my boiii,9
FINALLY IT'S OUR TIME TO WIN THE TITLE,5
This is gonna help rabada regain confidence for the finals match,3
welp. looks like an easy win for Mumbai,5
Bye bye SRH,4
Samad this was breathtaking ! He was really impressive whenever he got the chance.,8
Game is set for Thala to come in and... oh wait. :C,1
"Fuck you Rabada, I want the purple cap ~~of~~ on Bumrah's head. T_T",9
FUCKING RABADA YOURE THE GOAT,3
Rabada farming wickets,2
"Samad played a handy knock 
 
He's exactly what Indian team needs rn, hitter who can bowl some overs",5
I wonder if Pandey regrets taking that catch off Iyer,10
All those SRH misfields,7
Congrats DC!,3
Definitely mumbai will take dc over srh,6
All rests on Goswami now. He can swing them hard too.,9
Here comes the collapse,4
Imagine if they had an extra Saha here instead,8
SRH needed a Dhoni there,5
I knew DC losing against mi was just to get Rabada the purple cap with this extra game,7
"Not even showing a replay of the full toss is just ridiculous!  


They go to the third umpire for every fucking run out call, even when the batsman's 10 metres in, but cannot review a potentially match-deciding call. And they STILL haven't shown a review!",12
Theory : DC lost Qualifier to get that extra game for Rabada,7
I don't know who I am supporting anymore,3
Lmao Ponting still not impressed.,4
Warner keeps smiling like he already knows how this is gonna end,3
purple CAP nooo!,2
"Rabada and taking shit wickets at the end. 

rAbADA = bUmRAH",4
"Alexa Play ""Delhi se hai Bhenchod""",1
Gets the purple cap back,1
Has warner adopted that technique where you laugh/smile when you are angry ?,6
Warner should have done a thala and went to the crease.,3
"I liked Samad, good future...",1
Lol Warner trusts Rashid more than he trusts Goswami,4
Rabada reclaims purple cap now iirc,1
No worries Goswami will win this for us,2
"Goddamn, I'm aging fast.",1
Why was that not given as no ball.,1
Fielding is the difference between the two teams today.,7
Why does Ponting look so pissed?,1
Say it with me hatrick time!!,1
Congratulations MI,2
Goswami waiting to play the unexpected blinder?,2
Man those extras by SRH making the difference,2
"SRH dont take it lying down, love to see it. But gg DC!",1
why tf that wasn't no ball?,1
We lost to Mumbai so that Rabada and Dhawan could pad their stats with an extra game :p,3
Fuck the umpires who fail to give no ball for us in all matches,6
lmao why are they complimenting rabada so much when he just bowled two balls in the slot,7
SRH: Do not go gentle into that good night,5
"Come on Goswami, just need to hit 4 sixes. You can do it!",3
Rabada you beautiful tropical fish. You’re smart as a whip and you’re cool under pressure,2
MI gonna win this ipl Bois,2
Rabada the true Purple cap holder is back!,-5
Warners gone mad or what?! Man's been smiling for a good half hour now,4
"This is one of those matches where the fans of the losing team always thinks we were so close despite the fact that they were never in the game from the beginning to the end (when watching/analyzing from a neutral fan's perspective).

This is not a close match by any means. It only feels like it for those fans.",0
Fuck you srh top order. Fuck you Manish Pandey.,1
Warner bro u high or what?,9
"LOL DC fans 2 hours ago: lets face it or not we ain't winning shit

DC fans now: its time to win the title",12
Looks like Warner put in a bet against the team,2
"One off fielding day costing srh.... thanks rash, warner and Kane for taking srh so far in the tournament",7
"**18.4** Rabada to Rashid Khan, OUT, that oughta do it for DC. Rabada hasn;t quite nailed the yorker, but he is full enough to not let him get under it. Rashid tries, but goes only as far as long-on **167-7**

Rashid Khan c Patel b Rabada 11 (7b 1x4 1x6) SR: 157.14",3
Oh this is how it feels to be in IPL finale... can you back me up SRH fans. You have enjoyed this feeling few times.,1
That 'Rest' match gonna bite Bumrah in purple cap race now,3
"That was a no ball, right? DC got lucky there.",5
Imagine this bowling attack under a proper captain,5
How the fuck was that not a no ball btw,8
Rabada overtook Bumrah on purple cap. I'll take this any day if MI manage to win again,6
"Gg SRH, now I can sleep without worry knowing that MI has finale in bag",7
"Warner smiling too much, I'm scared",11
Oh jesus,2
Ponting ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯,1
Srh Warner is surely a lot calmer than Aussie David.,4
Lmao Ponting still looking like a murderer,3
"Guys seriously, why should little kids have to learn coding? Can't they do that after some years? This whitehat seems suspect",5
Lol wt f was this ball?!,2
Show replay of that full toss😡,11
See you in finals DC congrats,3
"From opening in the last match.

To coming at number 8.

Is this some sort of record lol?",8
"Hattrick ball, all 3 wickets visible bowls a bouncer lol",3
If that was a no ball. I would stop watching this league.,5
"Well if Warner doesn't make the final, he could still audition for a 70's era porn star with that 'stache",5
wide and rabada cries.,3
I'm sure Ponting will come up in the presser and say all the bowling changes today were his suggestions.,3
Bad angry guy Warner signals no ball from dugout and smiles after its not given. Calm guy Dhoni charges towards the umpire from Dugout.,10
Rabada goat,2
Hat trick. BC,3
"Ponting bud, your team has almost got into the final. Wouldn't hurt to smile a bit",3
That was a noball retards,3
"Samad has the potential. If he is groomed properly, could definitely be an asset.",2
How that wide... Goswami could have easily reach that with bat and jump,1
Is it a hattrick or not?,4
Hard luck Rabada,1
That Ponting scene was meme worthy template,6
"At this point, it's either full send or no send",2
Good effort from samad. In hindsight should have taken it to last over..,7
~~Hat Trick~~,2
It's a hattrick or not?,1
Sunrisers? More like sunsets,0
Gg,2
Hattrick,1
Omg Ponting know what Delhi school of bottling is capable of,7
See Goswami taking a single now,3
KG you beauty,3
Is it a hatrick,5
Free Wickets.,3
That wicket of kane Williamson by stoinis was the game changing one,6
Now for a qualifier 1 Revenge,2
These guys just donating the purple cap to rabada,10
Catching practice,2
Goswami you carrot,5
Rabada statpadding,8
Moral hattrick for rabada,3
Rabada has taken 4 wickets now.,3
You’re telling me we’ve had Keemo Paul all along ??!,5
SRH voting Rabada for Purple cap,10
LOL warner laughing,6
no more Warner closeups please. It's scaring me rn lol.,10
Tejaswi Yadav is still sitting in DC camp looking over a computer and analyzing.,6
F,1
Is this the Shrevats Goswami people were waiting for?,7
the PAIN behind Warners smile. :/,7
Dude someone please explain that creepy Warner's smile,3
Does this count as a hat trick,4
I guess I can be happy because my brother's friend is from the JSW family. Really reaching here. Wanted SRH to win because I have no hopes for DC in the final,5
Omfg Warner still smiling lmao.,7
Ponting😂😂,4
Rabada has murdered the purple cap.,8
Rabada shit housing this hat trick LMAAOO,6
"Shreewats Goswami : Opener to tailender. 


Ahahaaaahhaaaaahaaaa..........






(⇀‸↼‶)",8
feeling bad for Kanos 😭😭😭,5
Wtf SRH. Rabada has a 2 wicket lead now.,6
Duckswami,4
Is that a hat-trick? Previous ball was wide,3
Not a hattrick 🥺,3
"Tailenders wickets exist

Rabada: It's free real estate",5
Wait is that a hatrick?,4
"Stop, we're already dead",3
Now SRH can watch tiktok videos of Warner. BIG MORAL WIN.,9
In b4 people start shitting on Rabada for taking wickets,7
whoa hat-trick,3
Gifting rabada wickets... smh,4
Thank you Delhi.,0
W.W.Wd.W,1
Congratulations to MI for winning another IPL,5
"Ponting (when his team is winning) - :|
Warner (when his team is losing) - :D",7
Not a hattrick btw,2
he doesn't deserve purple cap,2
shittiswami,1
well thats one plus point of being a death bowler... you get a lot of free wickets,1
Warner doing his CRY-SMILING.,5
"And the SRH choke continues. When they fall, they fall pretty fast :(",9
KG you’re the best fuck I love you.,6
THIS MIGHT JUST BE THE BEST DEATH OVER IVE SEEN EVER HOLY SHIT,6
David Warner's moustache and smile is giving me serious Ted Lasso vibes.,2
I forgot that Goswami was a batsman what a waste,4
Lost the game in field. Some more tighter bowling and more importantly the fielding would have made the game closer.,9
SRH wickets falling like house of cards,3
I think we have it in the bag bois,4
Rabada !!!!!!!! You just missed the well deserved hat-trick,11
OMG Rabada you beauty,0
Is that a hatrick?,1
Stop gifting him the purple cap,6
"Stop the WIDE Count that was Hattrick 

Make Delhi Great Again",9
Was that a hat-trick ?,1
Warner is smiling because he knows the game was over when he got out...,7
"Thank you for the rules, But I'll take that as a hattrick :)",7
Warner smiling through pain is all of us going through 2020.,19
[removed],1
somethings wrong with warner i can feel it.,8
retarded umpires. Lost kxip due to 1short and now srh.,8
What a fucking rollercoaster of an over,2
Swann is so thick in the head.,3
Warner has a good therapist,10
Warner smiling is creepy as fuck.,13
Does anyone have a photo of that full toss to Samad?,6
Thanks Dhoni,1
"Guys you had one more, could've taken it a bit more deep",4
Is that a hat trick,1
Did not show a single replay of a clear no ball while we see shots of Warner smiling lol. Right,8
"Smh taking my boy's Purple cap, ffs SRH",7
Looks like we'll get to see another of those Ponting dressing room  speeches soon,2
Now we gonna miss saha,3
Bruh rabada,1
"Warner smiling through the collapse, Ponting still wanting to kill someone— you love to see it",8
The moment we lost Saha was the end of season for us,12
Collapse. Long tail SRH have,3
We come close. It was a good fight. The game was pretty much done and dusted at 40 odd for 3. Proud of our journey till here despite all the injuries.,10
These Jinxing Commentators themselves got Jinxed,5
Haha r/cricket was calling for SRH vs MI final.  Get to fuck,7
"As a RCB fan, it gives me great pleasure in sun risers going down",-2
SRH were very obliging in dropping everything. DC showing no class in holding their catches. Sad!,10
"Is that a hat trick?

3 wickets of 3 legal deliveries?",3
"Well, it was a good run boys, little we could've done.",5
"Screwed by injuries, screwed by umpires, screwed by sheer bad luck. Story of SRH's 2020 campaign",19
Haven't seen more shite wicket keeper batsman than Goswami,2
"Has Goswami ever done anything useful ever. What an awful batsman, literally is a walking wicket. Terrible behind the stumps too",3
I hope that wasn't a noball coz if it is im so done with  umpires being biased against us,5
MI are gonna absolutely cunt DC in the final aren't they,14
Where were you when SRH suicided?,1
"Even if SRH loses the match, the kind of fight this team has shown after losing so many of their main players is something the fans should be proud of.

They beat the top teams to make it into the play-offs and then made it into the top 3 as well. Hats off!!!

How can you not root for SRH when they have lovable characters like Kane and Rashid.",34
is it just me or do rabada and holder look the same,-3
"Warner

r/watchpeopledieinside",11
They should try sneeking YJB out there next. Nothing to lose now.,8
anyway free wickets baby lmao,6
I think Warner thinks he's still in Delhi team,10
"Do what you want, but please don't loose to MI. won't keep my hopes even at 20%, they have got y'all 3 times already this year.",5
"**18.5** Rabada to Goswami, OUT, and he has three wickets in three legal balls. Slower short ball again, Goswami looks to pull over midwicket but doesn't get any power into the shot. Caught at deep midwicket **168-8**

SP Goswami c Stoinis b Rabada 0 (1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00",3
Goti mu me tha bc,7
GO ON THEN KAGISO STATPADA YA BEAUTY,5
The banter between the dugout hosts is peaking.,3
Is Saha injured or what?,6
luckiest 5er if it ever happens,1
"Damn   
That Saha injury really upended the balance of the SRH lineup  
That last injury they couldnt recover from. Goswami is a MAJOR step down from Saha as far as batting (and keeping is concerned)",8
Cmon sandy you got this,2
Fuck I hope we release Pandey next time. Fucking deadweight,13
SRH doesn't deserve to lose like this. Damn,6
Sandeep Sharma to hit 4 sixes in the last over so ppl will remember his name.,5
The best comment Swann has made is about the double hat trick,4
Can we play the “Munday dilli ke” instead of this “roar Macha” bullshit?,5
Kabada Bc. What happened to the ko ball?,3
DC please don't fuck in the last over pleasee. No more Ls from here on,3
Purple cap coming down to the finals!! Rabada v Bumrah,10
Jason Holder is the prime example of you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.,5
Bowl nortje and not stoinis,3
I am gonna blame umpire for not giving a no ball for no second bounce.,15
srh vs umpires,5
Hope Mumbai fucking rekts DC,5
This is why KG gets shit loads of wickets in end overs. He is super accurate.,5
RABADA WITH 3 WICKETS. BEAST.,5
"I thought atleast 1 South Indian team gonna go to the finals. Srh you were the chosen one, why would you do this to us?.",4
Is that a hat trick by Rabada?,3
There's goes my bois purple cap,3
Umpires you're a retard. Fuck yourself with shame,1
This Bumrah x Rabada purple cap contest goes RIGHT to the wire.,7
"Oh we've seen this collapse before, this season",2
Pravin Thambe would've finished it for SRH.,1
Gotta win this now,1
[deleted],-5
I’m remembering the 2016 WC final. Fuck.,3
Ponting might murder Ashwin/Stoinis if they bottle the last over.,5
Such shit batting bro. You can get 22 runs in 6 balls ..... why risk so much against their best bowler? Yikes.,4
Murdered the purple cap standings. Not cool lol.,14
Free wickets,5
BUt bUT SOutH afRIcaNs aRe ChOkErs,10
Sad.,2
Rabada gave us hope and then smashed the living daylight out of it.,11
Not saying anything too soon,3
fuck the umpires man such a shit group of people,6
"As much as I'm happy for Delhi, I don't think they'll be able to compete with Mumbai. Iyer's captaincy today was mediocre at best. No proper plan. Just kept moving fielders wherever the ball went. Mumbai will blow them away if they're don't have a good plan.",10
Shreyas Iyer 69d chess to bowl himself now.,4
Wow Goswami is shit. Thats why he cam in at 8.,6
Rabada’s efforts finally getting rewarded with a win but he’ll be the lone bowler fighting against MI on Tuesday,4
"Holy fuck man. So many matches lost, and it doesn't even matter. We are in the final.",3
"Warner: 🔥""This is fine 🙂"" 🔥",16
Poor warner but you didnt play so fo,4
"Today Shikhar deserves MoM, Rabada got two tailenders",4
This innings has been a hell of a roller coaster.,9
"Feel bad for SRH tbh,",4
"So this is what Kohli meant by "" everything we hit went straight to the fielders for the last 5 games.""",14
I'm tired of seeing Virat in ads. More marketable than useful during IPLs.,9
Not to take away from Rabada but this why I think Jof and Bumrah have been better bowlers this season. A lot of the wickets Rabada gets are stats padding,8
"For people asking, that's not a hattrick for Rabada, more like a team hat-trick",5
"It's okay SRH, at least you accomplished your yearly mission of screwing over RCB before getting knocked out yourself..",40
At this point Idk if DC has caught more than SRH dropped,9
So basically DC took a detour to final because they wanted orange and purple cap,15
"Was rooting for DC tonight, but that ball for Samad before was looking like a no-ball. So Samad, basically got out on a ball which was to be a free hit. Feel bad for Samad & SRH for that.",9
They still haven’t shown the replays of the supposed no ball,23
Why did Goswami come at 9?,7
"Hi guys American here, new to the sport, is stoinis the messi of cricket?",16
Tbh this was still great season for SRH despite them losing so many players to injuries till the end,8
End of the road for Goswami in IPL.,2
Rabada's last three wickets and all of Stoinis's wickets - all have come from absolute dollies. Pitiful from SRH today.,12
"Rabada to himself - ""Watashiwa Monster"".",1
Warner smiling cause he knows he is going home.,8
I don't think Ponting is going to smile before DC wins the finals.,2
I know DC can't do shit against MI. But I still hope to get a new winner this season.,7
no replay for the noball and its not a fixed league.,16
Just give the trophy to SRH if the tail manages to beat Nortje,9
"Mumboys, we face DC again. There is something about Ponting and finals which makes me nervous. We better bring that A game once again come the D day.",20
davey can't stop smiling!,2
I have a feeling like Bumrah is going to get the Purple Cap. Because Mumbai will wipe the floor with Rabada. Sorry bro.,1
I'm blaming the no ball.,7
Inb4 Nadeem 3 sixes,0
in b4 0/4 next match /s,3
He missed the stumps from 1 meter distance,2
From an unbiased person- was that a no ball or not? Why didn’t Samad immediately ask?,10
Srh fans left with their dicks in their hands.,-2
DC needs alot to work to defeat Mumbai.,6
"It’s a pity that SRH decided to shit their pants, constantly throughout this match.",2
Rabada need 3 wickets against MI to break Bravo record,0
Pritvi Shaw eating chakna in the background😡,14
If DC wins final: Iyer - We just lost qualifier to give Rabada 1 extra match to get Purple cap,2
Can Nadeem pull off a Bipul Sharma,3
Rabada ahead of Bumrah fuck yes,2
LOL what kinda miss was that????????,1
Nokia missing run out to stat pad wickets,3
They still haven't shown the full toss replay.,2
Ponting's pissed about something and Warner's happy about something.,6
Ambani just this time please let delhi win,3
Arent Mumbai 3-0 up against DC this season?,3
"At least we fought, good game.",3
It's gonna be Ocean Blue vs Tequila blue finals,7
Shit umpiring cost us the game lol laughable,-4
Well ik mi are the favourites. But c'mon Cricket community let's come together for the underdogs. Let's make the meme team win,10
Dafaq Nortje?,4
Swann is absolutely FUN,7
The difference between the two sides has been the fielding. Srh conceded at least 30 runs more bcz of their fielding whereas DC has been very sharp.,6
This will improve DC NRR,12
MI vs rest of the world in the finals?,11
We lost to Mumbai 3 times to lul them into a false sense of security :p,3
"22 runs in one over, perfect opportunity for Nadeem except he's the batsman.",5
Rabada steals the \[purple cap again from Bumrah. Hope this causes Bumrah to come all guns blazing!,2
Ricky Ponting and Finals is dangerous. Really really dangerous.,2
Swanny hasn't seen lenskart ad runout,1
Whats with the toys in the DC dugout?,2
inb4 srh fans say they lost cause of the no ball.,9
"Just don't whimper out against MI

Put up a good fight my bwoys",8
For SRH to reach the finals they would have had to win 5 games in a row taking on top 3 teams twice. They got the 4 in. It's a bummer but a valiant effort nonetheless.,12
only if we had Khaleel on strike to defend on all 6 balls,2
[deleted],13
Congratulations MI for 2020 IPL Trophy 🏆,5
"We STILL haven't seen a replay of that full toss.   


Even if it wasn't a no ball, this is absolutely ridiculous at this point.",28
[deleted],9
"Dilli - Mumbai final, Bhenchod


Gol Gappe >>>>>> Paani puri",5
It’s been a good season boys. At least we went down fighting,8
"Shouldn't have sent Holder in at 6th over.

Could've been extremely useful at this stage.

Goswami would've been the perfect option to set a partnership with Kane at 6th over.",7
Sandeep Sharma is a pretty generic name,5
"Nadeem did his work, now Sandeep only has to hit 4 sixes. Easy.",7
WTF Nortje,4
Time to start the dancing?,2
DC going to lose to MI 4 times in a season this year,7
finally r/cricket vs MI,20
Tu roar maccha,5
Swanny wtf 😂,6
Looks like Ponting wants that trophy more than any of their players lol.,20
Im happy guys. I wish the DC bros good luck in taking on MI. I hope you can pick up a ton of momentum.,10
5 edges for 4 and a 2,1
"With so many front foot no ball controversies now third umpire decides it.

There has been several wring decisions with waist high no balls. These umpires are trying hard to hand it as well to the third umpire.",2
3 sixes for super over,1
"New ipl winner for 2020, might as well be true now",9
"He could’ve taken the ball in his mouth and dived into the stumps

-Swann",26
Congratulations Mi on 5 th title,16
Poor fielding cost SRH this match,6
That guy holding the Hulk figurine at the loss of wicket is the mvp.,9
"So, you had 2 over each from Stoinis, Rabada and Nortje. But you bowl Ashwin in the 18th. Why?",6
Fielding cost srh the match,13
"Go go go go, go, go, go, go

It's time to go home for the Orange army.",19
"The comments saying SRH deserve to be playing the Final instead of DC. No well they dont, not more than DC. They played well but that doesnt discard how DC played today and how they played the first half of the Tournament.",14
Fuck the umpires man,3
[deleted],14
Delhi go and win in finals please.,4
Delhi is going to pull of a MI 2017 and beat Mumbai in the finals.,13
People are still backing SRH against MI. You really think a full strength MI was getting scared by SRH? Lol,6
Lol harsha is such an srh fan boy. He looks broken,7
Bad fielding is clearly what cost us the most,14
"no ball aside, SRH loss this match in the field and with the ball clearly, too many mistakes",9
"I wonder who MI were rooting for...
They would be happy with dc I suppose",6
SRH had some rotten luck with their injuries. Could be a different game if they had their first choice players,11
Lol that lil fistbump between punter and kaif,7
He could have put the ball in his mouth and dived: Swann 2020,2
Then there is Rabada who is taking wickets of tailenders and getting the puruple cap.,7
I'm gonna miss Swanny after the final,3
"Had kane been there, it would have been a great game. Congratulations DC, beat Mumbai and win your first title",10
"While I highly doubt that DC will win the ipl, This was the best run! And am so proud",3
Congrats MI on winning another IPL,10
Nortje did his best South African impression but not enough for SRH.,3
Yorker dalde be nokia,6
So happy for DC! You deserved to be in the finals!,8
"Well boys, it was a fun ride nevertheless. See you next year. Also DC don't let MI win now pls.",18
Imagine if iyer wins as ipl captain before kohli. It would be funny.,27
If DC bottle the final after this performance......just disappointing,20
"He could have put the ball in his mouth and dived on the stumps. 

- Dugout",21
gg SRH - thanks for an entertaining tournament,6
In b4 MI 240/5 in finals,12
I just want Bumrah to have the Purple Cap :(,6
SRH should groom Natarajan and Samad for next season which isn’t that far,14
still no replay for the noball,2
I feel bad for bowler who are facing nokia,6
There's the replay,4
"Warner smiles as he fades into the dark. 

that damn smile. still spooks me.",8
One of the worst fielding performances I’ve seen. SRH would have saved at least 15 runs with competent fielding. I’m embarrassed tbh,15
😂😂😂😂,2
So the MI v DC final we predicted during the early stages is happening after all. Glad that we got to experience all the other twists along the way.,13
Warner gone early still came close. Well done srh. Saves my time on tuesday to not watch the finals,11
Fuck! this makes purple cap race more interesting ! Hope Bumrah manages to get that,5
I'm in a good mood,3
umpires be like eat shit kick ass,1
Lmao he saved his wicket,6
RIP the twitter guy's prediction.,22
"Gg Delhi, hope y'all win it all.",6
MI vs Delhi again. Could be a repeat of 2017 final...,8
YES !!!!,4
"4 wins in the last 5 games? I’m happy. We end the tournament on a good note. The teams which didn’t qualify had a lot of anguish given how tight it was. 

We came back strong despite injuries.",13
What just happened?,2
3 sixes Nadeem and then its super over!!!,2
Sandeep gave it everything he had 😂😂,6
Great match. May the best team win the finals.,8
Frankly I was impressed they made it till 170,12
"> Most wickets in an IPL season:

> 32 Dwayne Bravo (2013)

> 29 Kagiso Rabada (2020) *

> 28 Lasith Malinga (2011)

> 28 James Faulkner (2013)

> 27 Jasprit Bumrah (2020)",11
So it's the last 2 overs of each innings that decided the fate of both teams today,6
Last ball is a fitting tribute to SRH's tournament,5
"So, 190 is too big to chase in a KO game even for Kanos.",6
[removed],12
DC in finals for the first time!,4
Go DC,2
So just as was expected at the start of the tourney. DC and us are facing off.,4
Gonna eat momos in celebration.,6
Everyone vs MI,11
Sandeep's batting coach is Rishab Pant.,9
The worst thing about this loss is how smug SunnyG's going to be when SRH gets eliminated,6
So fucking happy after forever finally to the Finals. Whatever happens Tuesday happens. I am very happy with this also,10
Dilli final mai aa gyi at last.,9
Good game yall,6
Delhi win the finals and teach Mumbai a lesson,7
Maiden IPL final 🔥🔥🔥 for DC,18
LMAO @last ball.,7
"Well on the bright side, won't have to look at neckbeard Natarajan in the finals again. Fuck me I wanted SRH to win.",7
GG Delhi!,8
Get that trophy from MI,8
[deleted],1
"Proud of you Sunrisers.. You came in a long way with the B team... 

I liked the part, when you still gave a fight inspite of loosing Warner and Manish early...


This wasn't our day.. Chin up...played well...

Meet you next season...


Samad and Nattu the find of the season, Sandy bowled really well, Saha was the suprise package...",7
Yesssss... Bcccc,0
Why don't bowlers use atleast 20 percent of their practice time to improve batting?,2
Delhi has the capability to pull this off.,5
Is this fucking real. HOW THE FUCK ARE WE IN THE FINAL WHAT THE FUCK DELHI IN FINAL,13
What a season srh keep your heads high,8
Playoffs last year and final this year. We have progressed well since being DC. Perhaps next year we will win it going by the chronological order.,7
Fielding was the difference,6
"No moment of joy from DC's? Guys you have reached to the finals for the 1st time, show us some aggression",1
MI to DC: You couldn't live with your own failure. Where did that bring you? Back to me.,5
Wtf was that Sandeep? 😭😭,2
Shikhar had a good game today which means he'll go for a duck on the final. Congratulations Mumbai. Again.,4
FINALLY! FIRST TIME IN THE FINALS.. KILL IT BOYS!,10
"Good to see SRH losing, their fans had became a lot more cocky recently.",-2
Big Bicep Stoinis for MoM!,3
"Batsman falling to the ground in the final ball, sums up srh's campaign this season. Well played, really",4
Fans of 7 teams would be supporting Delhi on Tuesday. Hope they win.,7
Congratulations MI for the 5th IPL title!,-2
"Congratulations DC boys.. Finally we are playing a final. Whatever happens.. hell of a season..

Kudos SRH and Williamson for fighting till the end..",6
In a high pressure chase Williamson would never close out games.,1
"What an awesome campaign by SRH ! Handicapped due to injuries till the end, star players missing, but never gave up. Take a bow 👏👏👏🙏🙏🙏",12
"Oh! What a season this has been. Could have been really formidable but the injuries never stopped haunting us. The guys played with the best they had, few lows but overall a  great season nonetheless. I am looking forward to root for y'all again in 6 months or so. Well played bois. Congrats DC.",9
"DC has a better chance against MI anyways. they have played 3 games against them already.  
cant wait for Tuesday!",7
Delhi now just need to not shit the bed against Mumbai as bad as they did the other day,6
Congrats DC. No worries srh yall really won lot of respect nobody really hates yall lmao,7
"4 wins in the last 5 games? I’m happy. We end the tournament on a good note. The teams which didn’t qualify had a lot of anguish given how tight it was. 

We came back strong despite injuries.",16
"Oh well tough luck SRH boys, let's hope DC can take this same momentum to MI, really want them to win",8
"Sorry SRH, your absolute shit fielding lost you this game.",13
"Backing DC to win against MI, pls show up like you did today",13
If SRH had Saha instead of Goswami they win imo.,9
Go get mi dc bois,7
All of r/cricket supporting DC the under dogs for the final,9
Why people hate DC so much? They are the only team which really can give a fight to MI.RCB and SRH were highly dependent on 2 players.,8
"Everytime RCB changed logo, SRH won title.

SRH started similar in 2016 - SRH won title.

So many indications that SRH will win this year - BUT ITS 2020, nothing is normal!!!!",9
For the first time in the tournament we have reached the finals,2
And MOTM goes to.... Scott Styris.... for his amazing unacademy cracking sixes against Mr. A.G.,1
Scenes if Pant takes DC home in the finals,7
Lmao MI DC were so ahead of the pack at first and life has come full circle within a season itself.,4
Is it possible to listen to the dugout in the UK without too much effort?,4
Gg guys,1
"The final is going to be amazing, Mumbai is an amazing team, but I believe that we’re winning this IPL. Love this team! Let’s go Delhi.",6
Delhi for the title baby. 7v1  give us your energy bois.,6
We have reached the final with the dumbest captain in the game. How about that!,4
Feel bad for kane but let's go delhi capitals we can do this in the finals also,2
god what a disappointing anti-climactic end :/,7
Warner rarely fails. But there is nobody to take team through. Over reliance on Warner is huge problem with SRH.,3
"Man, Ponting looked like a grumpy old dad, who forced his kids into performing pretty good and still won't be happy.",11
So happy,3
Unbelievable,2
Legend has it that Warner is still laughing,12
SRH completely fucked up while 12 balls were remaining 🙄,8
We did all this just to get all out at 117 on Tuesday 😭,4
This is the first time I'm seeing an IPL final on a working day.,7
The flairs go down.,8
"Good luck DC, don't let Mumbai win please!",5
"I think I have achieved some peace today. Wow Delhi you managed to get in final in my lifetime. Thank you very cool. Now lets go show Mumbai why we the Capital of India. 

Lets go fucking boissss",2
Mumbai Lads vs Mumbaiyya Captain Shreyas,3
"Will be rooting for Delhi in the finals. Would love to see a new champion, instead of the same old MI. Please don't disappoint us DC!",7
"I love this srh side tho, next year boys",21
"Well played lads, well played",1
Stoinis MOM or rabada?,2
"Who was our MVP today? 

1.Stoinis
2. Dhawan
3. Rabada",3
"With DC being in final, every single one of the current 8 IPL teams have been in final at least once.",9
Literally Everyone: Told you it's DC vs MI in final at the start of tournament,8
Nadeem single handedly lost srh the match with shit fielding,6
Finally SRH fans will calm the fuck down.,-5
Congrats SRH on a fighting 3rd place finish! Respect,6
Great season boys. Thanks for entertaining us despite all the injuries. Keep going 🙏🧡🧡🧡,14
"So who will end up with the purple cap, bumrah or Rabada?",7
First final bitches,4
Atlast DC vs MI...,1
Did they show the no ball replay yet?,3
Never thought Delhi would enter thier first ever finals by having to carry Pant on thier shoulders. I used to think it would have been the other way around.,8
Finally we're in the finals,7
"Every leap year we had new winners.
2008 - RR (Obviously)
2012 - KKR
2016 - SRH
2020 - DC?",11
Respect for seh for even coming this far,4
Good game all round. Stoinis MotM.,6
Ponting doesn't trust DC's batting that he's fully dressed in the jersey just in case he needs to come in at 3.,41
"Not a big loss, only 17 runs. It should help us with NRR in the IPL next year. 

PS: Can't wait to see Dhawan, Rabada, and Nokia light up MI on Tuesday.",23
"Well played SRH, seriously thought they'd lose by a huge margin.",15
After 12 years of feeling and made to feel miserable. Finally!,14
Congrats DC,6
WLWL for DC. Can they break that pattern?,8
"Iyer has to be praised, his batting has been bad but he has lead us to the first ever Finals. Stoinis is a fucking God. Dhawan, Hetmyer, Rabada, Nortje love ya",10
SRH were too lax in the field and bowling. They batted well considering the DC bowling strength. But DC were just too good with bat & ball.,11
So IPL 2021 starts again in 5 months time. Imagine being a champion for only 5 months and then defending it all over again.,4
"Stoinis proving once you leave RCB , sky is the limit",20
Well played boys. It was a great season for us.,21
**Team with most IPL trophies** vs **Team with maiden IPL Final.**,9
Thank you DC for beating SRH. Awaiting you in the finals.,11
If Delhi wins will shreyas become the youngest captain to win an ipl???????,13
Well this playoff format almost makes sure that 1 and 2 play finals..very rare any of top two teams to lose both playoffs..and it makes almost impossible for 3 and 4 to win 3 consecutive matches.well played by srh though .,8
Lol Warner is shaking hands . Been a while since we saw that .,12
"This mfs still haven't shown that replay of no ball.

What the fuck is this shit!!!",16
"Calling stoinis motm, contributed with bat, ball and field",7
MI gonna chase DC's 112-8 in 12 overs and win their 5th title,7
"Our first IPL final after 13 years. This feels UNREAL.


ALL MY DILLI BOYS RISE UP ❤️",15
"Full support to DC in the finals, plz dont let MI win 5",14
"damn dugout is SO savage, swann is an absolute legend we need him everywhere",7
"Positives from the season: Gave a chance at the big platform for many new Indian players, some of whom capitalized. Negatives: Weak Indian middle order, something to focus on in the next auction",10
"2 best teams are in the final. I dont mind if anyone wins, I'll be happy.",4
Why is Stoinis carrying a Hulk figurine?,9
Lol after so of drama in the latter stages of the tournament it came down to MI vs DC in the finals.,7
"since my home town (csk) is out, I'm supporting my birth town and my home (DC) to win this IPL.",10
"Stoinis in RCB : I sleep

Stoinis in DC : Real Shit",31
BLUE ARMY WON. ORANGE ARMY  AND RED ARMY)  LOST.,7
"Though we failed in Bowling n Fielding but Kane Williamson and  Samad fought back well💪💪💪, Nothing Shameful... But just a Sad ending 😐.",16
True underdogs are DC,5
"Hats off to SRH for coming this far the deserve to be in play offs, at one point it looked like they were gonna make it but Big stoin and rabada said no",9
Stoinis holding a hulk action figure damn,21
The game was over the moment Warner got out. Well played Williamson but there's just not enough firepower to chase 190.,5
Stoinis MoTM surely?,10
what's with the hulk?,5
"In the end, it was that manic DC power play that undid SRH. Proud of the boys though.",7
"sunrisers got closer than i thought tbf, they're only a player or two off the top sides, i hope they dont go for too much overhaul",8
So it's r/Cricket vs MI,18
Thanks DC! won 35 coins by betting just 10 coins lol,8
Warner's unbelievable consistency is the reason SRH's shit batting line up is only considered bad not pathetic.,4
"Does anyone know if any team has won the IPL after losing their last league match? It has never happened in Cricket World Cup, and wondering if it's the same with IPL and the probability of DC lifting the trophy. MI lost their last league game and DC won theirs",2
I don't even know what to feel lmaooo,6
So the teams ended up exactly as they were on the table after the playoffs. Noice,6
"GG SRH. Despite all the injuries and close matches we made it this far. Hope we come back much stronger next year and carry the momentum.  It has been a hell of a ride with this team and this sub.

And finally to Kane Williamson: Ek hi dil hai kitne baar jitoge

T: I only have one heart how many times would you win it with your performances",26
So we're 3-0 down to Mumbai this season. But I'm still optimistic about the finals. Let's go DELHI!,6
Stoinis with the Hulk omggg,5
"Dcio to SRH: Requiescat in pace

\*retracts hidden blade\*",6
"We’ve lost 3 games to MI just this year, can we get it right on our last try? Man it’s gonna be tough.",12
Wow isn't Warner happy to fly home,10
It’s going to be everybody vs MI on Tuesday. Can’t wait.,26
Stonis could do no wrong today,12
Mumbai pls thrash dc on tuesday. Would rather take the defending champs building on their legacy than some underdogs claiming the crown,-12
I wanna see some more of kane😓,12
So a new winner in leap year stands?,3
And also well played to SRH. To get this far with regular injuries and Manish Pandey can't be easy,10
"After their showing in the last 4 games it was only a matter of time before SRH ran out of steam. Their fielding today was poor and on the back of that they didn't deserve to win. Great effort by KW and Samad to put up a fight but ultimately we lost hold of the match in the 1st innings.

Overall, I'm really happy with the effort and season SRH had. I only wonder how we would have fared if we weren't plagued by injuries.

Marsh, Bhuvi, Vijay Shankar (was doing well with the ball and just starting to find form with the bat), and Saha (gave us great starts with the bat). Ultimately it wasn't to be.

Boys can keep their heads up and I am looking forward to next season and hopefully we can stay fit and injury free.


Good luck to MI and DC in the finals. They way MI played this year, they deserve to be champions. Let's hope DC can put together a great performance and I'm hoping for an exciting match.",16
So no butta bomma dance today,9
There is one more match left this season and I am already missing the league. 5 months is so near yet so far.,5
Bad fielding and umpiring fucked SRH,9
[deleted],19
All this roller coaster tournament for the final we wanted to see from the start.,4
"[Downvote me as much as you want to, I'll be sleeping happily today. Bye bye reverse jinxers.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/jqarkr/match_thread_qualifier_2_delhi_capitals_v/gbluf2t?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3)

I feel sad for Kanos and Warner though. They gave their 110%!",4
"Delhi Capitals in the finals of the IPL for the first time, ohh man how long have we waited for it. COMEE ONN BOYSSS!!",6
"USA : BIDEN WITH BLUE ARMY. 

UAE : IPL FINAL BETWEEN BLUE ARMY.",10
an absolute dream come true,1
"Man what an effort by SRH despite all the injuries they have had

Definitely a season to remember for them",27
We broke the playoff curse boys!!!,6
"So in the final, it is almost a certainty that MI gonna bat second. Now, DC must be thinking they are good at batting 1st and MI will go for a dew factor and bat second.",5
We should be proud of all the players. They did the best they could and should go easy on youngsters like Garg and Sharma who will takeaway the most from this year’s ipl,23
Entire IPL Career stats - Kohli plays slower than Kane.,16
I’m leaning towards MI. Make your golden generation  Count and extend your lead over csk. I’m ok with Delhi winning as well.,8
DC looks weak relative to MI. They need Dhawan to score a big one. Iyer/Pant are in meh form  and so not much can be expected from middle order. They need to bat 1st and score like today. But not sure it would be easy against Bumrah and Co.,6
HEY NO FAIR!!!! STOP THE COUNT! ALL THOSE ILLEGAL RUNS BY DC ARE RUINING OUR DEMOCRACY!!!,17
I'm absolutely satisfied with srh effort great game.,20
First final in 13 years let's go so fuckingggg hapoyyyy,22
That's what you get from Stoinks for not submitting to Zampa ╭∩╮（︶︿︶）╭∩╮,7
"Lots of talk about Delhi ""deserving"" the title this time and ""teach MI a lesson"".

These things make me want MI to thrash DC. At least MI isn't full of arrogant pricks, both on the field as well as this sub.",9
Are TV umpires not allowed to call no balls wrt height? Is it only limited to overstepping?,5
SRH has awesome fans. So positive!,17
"After all the name calling and mud slinging, DC still got to the finals. So happy that the team picked up just in time and showed why they were favorites to reach finale (MI were a done deal from day 1 so no surprises there)",6
Battle of the purple Caps on Tuesday then,10
"Well played to DC.- Rabada, Dhawan. Played well. You'd better play that well on Tuesday ;)",16
DC prove everyone wrong and beat MI in the final,10
"Everyone here saying fielding cost SRH the match, but in reality it was your cringe ass reverse jinxing. SRH flairs, please for the love of God, be normal people in the next season.",10
Time to finally change my flair back to Delhi Capitals after 7 matches,8
If Rabada retains his purple cap DC wins the final!!,7
Punter's gonna do a 2003. I have a feeling.,7
"How hilarious will it be if DC wins it this year and KXIP win it next year, leaving Koach and RCB as the only active side to never win IPL",19
"Can we have some jersey alterations for the Final

I can't fathom 22 indistinguishable blue men running around the field for 4th fucking time",20
DC hasn't lost a single final,78
"Bumrah has been much better than Rabada, better economy, better wicket to match ratio and Rabada has very few powerplay wickets",12
"Warner : Hyderabad is my second home

Never thought I'd see a wholesome David Warner moment!!!",35
Rabada sounds so sexy,7
I can only hope that SRH hold on to Williamson by all means and never let him go.,19
"rabada against mi this season - 2 wickets

bumrah against dc this season - 7 wickets",10
I can finally work tomorrow with a light heart and a sense of satisfaction in life,7
"Chad KG Rabada Jassi Bumrah
Virgin KL",4
KG’s response is copy-paste of Bumrah’s haha,7
"Doesn't matter how many times MI has won - this is not a charity and if you're a cricket fan, surely you'd want the best team to win, not because some mismanaged team hasn't won even once in 13 years.",21
"Iyer , the first Delhi captain to take us to the finals. Thanks skipper!!",29
Rabada is like shit gets wickets i can't help it.,14
such a team player,4
Warner was so wholesome in the post match presentation,9
"THAT guy on twitter was wrong...

Sad",16
Congratulations to DC for making it to the finals for the first time. Lot of character and intent shown by Gabbar to the game away from us right from the start. Hoping for him to carry that form to the Indian team,12
"We had  great season  , hope we come back stronger next season:)",10
[deleted],20
GG. See you next season.,5
Rabada is so wholesome!,10

I love Warner's post match interviews. Dude speaks from the heart.,29
"""Hyderabad is our second home, the franchise owners are like a family""

God i am gonna Miss SRH and IPL 😭",41
"And before someone calls me ""salty"", I've said umpteen times that even SRH management is full of idiots.",3
I wonder whether I could love anyone else as much as I love Kanos.,25
"We’ve shit on Iyer for a while, but he deserves the credit for brining in Stoinis for the PP and then in the death for taking the match winning wicket of Kane. Dhoni pulled the same shit all the time, he was applauded for it. Let’s give the young guy some breathing room.",47
"Imagine being a Delhi fan and after 13 years you see your team get into the finals :'''')

Good luck bhenchods",39
"I think srh fanbase would not be disappointed with their team at the very least. Got down with injuries, fought hard, made it till the qualifiers and didnt give up till the last ball. Had they fielded a lil better they would be so in the game",32
I would usually be confident with MI abt final but this is 2020 so.. *nervous chuckles*,9
Can David Warner buy property in Hyderabad? I am guessing he already has.,23
Your daily reminder that Kane has better average and strike rate than both Kohli and Smith in IPL and he barely got picked in IPL auction.,36
"So all the OGs have made it to the finals! 

Let’s hope the 4-0 meme stops this year.

All the best DC. #ROARMACHA",8
Have they showed the no ball yet?,4
Lmao look at Twitter,1
Ponting: I was 100% sure that taking Stoinis out of the attack after a double wicket over in the powerplay and reserving him for the 17th over would get us the wicket of Kane Williamson.,10
DC haven't lost a single must win game in the tournament so far. Just saying ..... Mangal ko mangal hoga.,9
"Final on Tuesday which sucks though , it would be literally MI vs rest of India lol , let the game begin",9
Well played SRH! Great game. See you in 5 months,10
"SRH : Heartbroken. 

RCB : First time?",17
Proud of the boys to have come this far despite all the barriers. Great season of IPL 🧡🔥🔥🙏,35
SRH specifically exists to either fuck up RCB or KKR's seasons or both and then lose to other teams in playoffs.,22
Time for everyone to unite against MI.,11
"What a season for SRH, proud of the team. 
All the best to MI/DC",10
If delhi win ipl we get to see fantastic end to the documentary made by gaurav kapoor's company since last season they have been capturing the behind the scenes workings of the team.,9
"Stoinis saying Fuck you to SRH 

For messing with Zampa in the eliminator",31
"Okay honest talk, which fans will be supporting MI on Tuesday and which won't?",4
"When Delhi Wins , they gave credit to Ponting and when Delhi lose , they blame Iyer.",30
Is Murali Karthik wearing a choker,6
Dc is to srh what srh is to rcb,7
I’m sure Ponting has done a lot behind the scenes but it’s absolutely absurd to take the credit from Iyer and give it all to Ponting. He’s still the one out on the field.,34
Murali Kartik,4
Nortje has looked lacklustre in the knockouts which is a big blow to us.,11
So its MI vs India,15
"Don't know where RCB went wrong with Holder, he was really a hittable bowler.",15
Ricky ponting is determined to win it ..ALL THE BEST DC please win it ..you will have massive support of from fans of most franchise.No hatred for Mi though..just would be nice to see a new winner..,14
[deleted],13
Kanos deserves a win. He's such a gem. He always steps up for his team when they need him. An amazing knock today and in the previous match. Such a genius with the bat. Love him way too much!,26
Alright who wants to buy Manish Pandey from us?,6
"I love these post-match interviews with Kagiso Rabada. He's such a humble bloke, I love to hear him talk and give his perspective on the game. He's quickly becoming on of my all time fave personalities, not just in IPL, but in all of cricket.",9
It's MI vs rest of the world.,12
Glad that guy on twitter was wrong. Would've ruined the fun otherwise really,19
"MI: We have built the best team and will give everything to win the trophy

DC: We haven't won in 13 years, let us please..",19
"DC vs MI



Rishabh vs Rohit



For the heavyweight title.",28
2-8? Murali? Seriously?,2
If Mumbai wins against Delhi that would be the third time in a row where the winner cleansweeped their final opponent in that edition,10
DC BC,4
"Safe to say Stoinis is our best AR ever already, Morris was good but he wasnt consistent with both bat and ball.",8
"if the leap year thing turns out to be true

rcb/kxip have 4-8 years for their title",10
Yes I’m crying,7
"IPL Trophy *exists*

MI: 👉👈 is for me?",14
"Man I hate to say this but Rashid chokes under pressure. 2018 finals and today. Not just this but even with slightest counter attack, he'll fumble. I hope he'll grow out of it",11
"Holy shit I did not realize this was Delhi's first final. I was pretty sure they got into the finals with Sehwag. Either way, best of luck guys, and my the best team win!",8
"Iyer and Punter one step away from Delhi Cricket HoF. 

Okay, that’s an overstatement. Still, it’d be sick.",6
So now all IPL teams have appeared in the final. Noice.,22
I have a feeling Delhi are going to absolutely destroy MI,12
"Asking RCB experienced experts, please tell me how to get over Srh failure ?",21
Come on DC now grab that trophy,14
It's time DC win IPL trophy.. new team needs to win this. All the best DC.  Great campaign by SRH. Never been more proud to wear this flair.,24
I hope this is like the 2013 final. An underdog MI beating a heavyweight CSK to claim their first title.,14
"DC will be starting in the IPL Finals, as the UNDERDOGS.",12
Ok boys time to make the sledge thread,7
My prediction is the team wearing blue will win the final.,30
DC: fourth time's a charm?,16
So warner said Manish had been amazing for SRH at 3. Nice we will see him again,11
Lol people hoping DC win Ipl just because MI won 4 times. Isn't it a competition of who's the best. Sure if DC plays well they deserve it. Its so poor mentality from guys. Get best not hope that other team goes from best to better,-17
"**Every Leap year there has been a New Champion in the IPL**

Let’s go DC",15
Letting Stoinis go is classic RCB 🤡moment.,26
Lol Shikhar Dhawan didn't get anything despite a brilliant 78.,17
Stoinis just admitted Ricky calls the shots,25
Shame about SRH - feel bad for Kane missing out after his good innings,24
">Let's have MI vs DC final and get it over with...(few comments a month back)

Damn! The prophecy which was looking ridiculous now lives fine. Never thought DC will reach final of all.",17
Lets go Delhi!,17
Not sure about Pravin in the team when the captain does not trust him. Play free wicket in Shaw lower in the order instead.,13
After 6 long years we have new finalist,12
"Coming from an MI fan, SRH fanbase is probably the chillest and least toxic fanbase in the entire IPL",54
"Congrats to SRH for an incredible journey. By far the unluckiest team this season with all the key players getting injured every match, and yet these madlads made it all the way to qualifier 2",60
And again a player RCB let go starts to perform extremely well after leaving,22
[deleted],22
"Dilliwalon,it's coming home!!",6
It's u/singhsrb vs Mumbai Indians 😂,20
Holder reminded of Sammy 2013 where he wins a match to get SRH to playoffs and then fumbles a catch or something bad in Eliminator,16
Has Nortje turned shit during the clutch phase of the tournament!?!?,26
"After seeing MI slapping DC thrice with no semblance of a fight from DC, it would be huge upset if DC gets a win. This being their first final further ensures some players will crumble.

DC needs to pull off a *surprise motherfucker*!",32
SRH were playing with10 players today tbh.,17
[Thank you commentators](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/jqarkr/match_thread_qualifier_2_delhi_capitals_v/gbm1036/),5
Final should be a yo-yo test between iyer and vada pav.,40
"Srh injury list : bhuvi, shankar , saha, marsh  still they performed so well deserves credit",42
MI has never lost a final right or did they against csk?,3
"I think fielding has been the difference between two sides today. Atleast 3 midfields resulted in boundaries, also 4 overthrows by Rashid and 2/3 dropped Catches.",21
"DC did a whole lot good to themselves by not sending in Rahane after Stoin, would have killed the momentum and be 20 runs short.",14
SRH must go for Prithwi Shah in auction. Perfect fit for Warner!,6
Abdul Samad can be a good prospect for India if he works more on his bowling and gets groomed well... he's really a good striker of the ball.,26
"Ahh shit its water type vs water type

Squirtle Squad Rise!",18
Now we can make a really good team with rcb pass outs. A team even mi cannot beat.,14
"Every leap year, there has been a new winner in the IPL, and it's 2020.",13

"Dhawan threw off his wicket (didn't reviewed), to make it equal — the umpire didn't gave the no ball to Samad. 3d move.",10

"Liked the DC decisions by Iyer (or was it Ponting?)

-	sending Stoinis to open thereby allowing Dhawan to warm up without pressure to score
-	sending in hetmeyer instead of rahane 
-	Allowing rabada to bowl early in powerplay. Think he was bowling outside PP in last few matches. Rabada regains purple cap with 4 wickets and silence his critics by taking important wickets not the chump change ones
-	making stoinis bowl in powerplay. The lad is in good form. Only made sense to give him bowl early. And he delivered. 3 wickets in 3 overs. 
-	introduced a mystery spinner at the nth moment to surprise the opposition. Though it didn’t click. 
-	had a solid strategy (practiced well) against Rashid Khan. They were trying to play every ball. Think he went for more than 25 runs in 4 overs which would be one of his worst performances. 
-	played freely in powerplay. 60 plus in 6 overs and 100 plus in 10 overs. They will definitely attempt this again against mumbai. They just need to figure out a way to play their top quality bowlers 

Overall, lots of positives for Delhi. Let’s hope they play mumbai smartly too.",33
"Slightly out of context, but why do bowlers (especially Indian) bat so poorly? I mean intent, not skill. Rashid showed very good intent (like he always does) but fell to Rabada, no issues. What was Sandeep doing going so far down the legside leaving all three wickets? Sure 20 odd in the final over noone expects him to hit, noone is going to blame him, that's not his job. Not singling out Sandeep either, almost every specialist Indian bowler bats like this.  I'd have liked to see some 'swing for the fences' shots, and some spirit till the end. Even the running between wickets is so poor like 'I don't really care if I get out, this is not my job' lazy running. Is there some reason for this?",32
i can't believe the madlads actually did it. I was so used to this team being a bottom feeder i just hoped they could somehow make it to the qualifiers. The last two seasons have been amazing to watch as a delhi fan.,20
"13 years of me sticking with this side having more downs than ups normally and hoping for some miracles out of nowhere. At last this team has reached the finals for the first time and boy ohh boy it's a wonderful feeling. I know the last and the most toughest hurdle awaits us now, but irrespective of the result I'm really proud of the boys. Thankyou Delhi Capitals, go out there, play your best and hopefully win the goddamn thing.",38
Always remember lads that 2nd position is the 1st position of losers. So we win on Tuesday or we did no better than a RR or CSK.,-50
What a match this was...,5
So What About Finals???,2
"I know we did alot better than we expected with our main players injured and we gave a good fight too. But a loss still hurts when we almost in the game till 23runs in 15 balls required and everything turned around. Our bois did well but hurts not to cross the line when we were this close. Arrghhh can't get over it.
