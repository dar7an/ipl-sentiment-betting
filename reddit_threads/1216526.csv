"Battle of the captains!

Which one can lead a comeback today?
Superb matchups today ngl",2
[deleted],-7
Probably the most important game of the tournament for both KKR and SRH.,13
We don't need 2 specialist fielders in the team as Manish Pandey and Priyam garg do we,0
I want KKR to win today. Let's see how it unfolds!! üòä,1
Well are any of the matches today gonna affect rcb?,2
I can already hear people shout russell or gill for captain if kkr loses again today(Morgan is doing fair enough with an average of above 40 and the second Highest run scorer for kkr),0
who won the toss?,1
"If KKR win today, I think our top 4 are complete. I don't see any team overturning a 2 game gap with only 5 games to go. Plus, KKR have already played their 2 matches against Mumbai",4
"Last time these two sides met, manish and gill hit fifties, and kkr was the winner

Srh fans whenever manish has scored 30+ they have lost, ik who u guys will support when he comes on to bat",0
Great that Narine is back. Hope to see a better batting effort this year time.,0
Williamson will score a fifty today,3
"Any news on narine? And how long they are going to trust russel? They have problem at the top order so banton has to play. Rana is so out of touch, but who will they replace him with? So maybe banton, gill, DK, morgan, tripathi, (rana replacement), cummings could be their batting order.",1
"Days like this are awesome. 8 hrs+ of cricket and no RCB induced PTSD or stress to worry about. 

Can just chill and enjoy good cricket.",13
hoping SRH wins.,4
Was just watching cricbuzz and I think Ajay Jadeja was drunk while on the show,1
"Both team coming of 2 consecutive losses. With KKR getting completely outplayed in their 2 games, SRH looks better.",3
"Should be a good match with both teams desperately needing a win. Again, looking forward to Gill making a good impression.",1
KKR‚Äôs batting first,2
"Ngl Morgan nonchalantly walking with the shades on towards the pitch, looks a tad intimidating",2
Nooooo not Thampi we are fucked,0
"KULDEEPPPPP

YESSSS FINALLY",4
"If KKR win, SRH are probably out of the tournament.",4
"The scenes if Sunrises steamroll every side and make it to the Playoffs.




Yeah right, Who am I kidding?",7
"If your best bowler is bought for 15.5 crores, bowls at an avg of 125 at an economy of 8.62 and has taken only 2 wickets, then he isn't ur best bowler, he's pat cummins ur best batsman",13
Happy to be neutral again today... Let's have a last ball finish boys. Will root for my boi Kulya,1
"Tears in my eyes

Do we finally have another captain that trusts Kuldeep after Gambhir ?

Kuldeep FC eating Gucci tonight .",28
"**KKR**

* Tripathi

* Gill

* Rana

* Karthik (W)

* Morgan (C)

* Russell

* Cummins

* Mavi

* Kuldeep

* Ferguson

* Chakravarthy",3
This is KKR's best XI,4
"**SRH**

* Warner (C)

* Bairstow (W)

* Pandey

* Williamson

* Garg

* Shankar

* Samad

* Rashid

* Sandeep

* Natarajan

* Thampi",5
Pretty sure Davey said we replaced Nadeem with a spinner. Did he really mean Samad lmao,9
Frankly speaking Abhishek has done far better with both bat and ball compared to Samad. Disappointed.,8
David Warner just follows the latest trend. He chose to bowl today cos chasing teams are doing well recently. Lol.,-3
"Benching prasidh was harsh tbh, Mavi stares into the heaven and bowls and imo krishna is better and more experienced",3
If we lose this it's gonna be hard season ahead,4
Cummins needs a promotion. Surely your best batsman shouldn't be batting at no 7.,10
"Ah fucking hell why thampi, khaleel atleast takes wickets",0
No Narine :(,0
Hoping for Thampi to do well.,6
the beat in the dugout is amazing,1
KKR looks twice as better compared to us on paper.,2
"Whose win would be a profit for CSK
?",0
Lockie and pat. We gonna get fuked,3
How fast does Lockie Ferguson bowl?,2
"After our kkr matches are over, I would love to see russell and Cummins side by side obliterating the opposition bowling",0
[deleted],4
Only players that are performing for KKR is getting blame for their loss.,2
"An Aussie and kiwi pacer huh, looks like kkr is following the mi model

(In all seriousness tho, 2 overseas pace options is  key to this tournament so far)",10
"Srh choosing to bowl first is interesting, they have always been a good defending side not chasing",6
"Honestly khaleel is doing fine, anyone know why he was replaced with thampi?",3
Warner hasn't clicked for us so far this IPL. He needs to get that strike rate up if we want to win games.,6
Ma boy Lockie is playing today. Been a long time since we last saw him bowl.,2
People who have tatasky app can you watch Star channels in it? It shows hotstar not installed error but I have hotstar installed?,1
Great decision from SRH to bring in Batsil Thampi with his IPL batting average of 32.,3
I want our entire batting order to be on fire today. I'm probably going to be disappointed but hopefully today might be a lucky day.,2
"At Abu Dhabi, 170 would be a good enough total I think. It's been pretty hard to chase there.",2
"If we win this game today, we are making it to the playoffs for sure. Not because we are good, but because the bottom 4 teams are worse than us.",13
"Only two teams have won after winning the toss and opting to field first

Game 1: csk vs mi

Game 9: rr vs kxip",0
Baap ka Bhai ka Dada ka sabka badla lega re tera Rusell!,4
We are known to be shit chasers. Y r we bowling first,6
Past 2 years KKR had horrendous bowling. This year they have managed to bat even worse. I have absolutely no hope today. All set for another collapse.,11
Ok explain why the heck we are bowling first..?,7
Any theories why narine is not playing? He was cleared just few hours back so probably that's not the case.,2
Shubman gill needs to play a little aggressive,2
"We lost this , we out",7
We are trash at chasing and we are bowling first in an afternoon game. Hopefully there is a good reason behind the decision. I can find any,5
Hope SRH makes it today after CSK got its karma yesterday for their shenanigans,6
Morgan is 60% forehead.,4
Damn Morgan looks way too happy on the match card lmao,2
Yo that long hair umpire,4
Who is this women umpire?,3
Who is this lady umpire?,1
"Let‚Äôs go SRH, don‚Äôt let KKR win and make the tail end of this tournament a snooze fest.",2
"We have Michael Jackson as umpire.  
Nice.",8
First time seeing this long hair umpire. Who is that?,4
Was it a Women umpire or man with long hair?,5
"Let‚Äôs go boys, pretty much make or break for srh",5
"We were supposed to have one of the best finishes 
Eoin Morgan 
Dk
Russell 
Cummins
Sadly it hasn't worked that great",3
Who is the wicket keeper for srh?,3
Is the red cloth a lucky charm for Gill?,3
What did Khaleel do wrong to be dropped??,1
Let's break the mould boys!,4
All I‚Äôm gonna say is KKR is playing down based on all the skills they possess and Srh is pushing above it‚Äôs weight when it comes to winning with an average team - as they always have been.,6
[deleted],52
"We are going BatDeep‚Ñ¢ today

Let's see how it works",7
C'mon boys. Time for a comeback,6
"Gill hogs up some dot balls up front , it's ok if you can make up later but with his style of play he needs to at least run down some .",2
"A team who is coached by Baz, has the lowest powerplay scores this IPL. üßê",46
Warner's moustache is a crime against humanity,53
A 4 point match for both teams,1
"Wow ,and we had him at no. 7",2
Bowl 3 overs of Sandeep in pp pls,7
"Pies from the 1st over , sums up our bowling",3
The top three teams have atleast two foreign pacers in their XI. So Ferguson coming in looks like a good change!,5
Just keep the ball down every shot and we will be good,3
Kkr why the fuck was Tripathi down the order?,5
"Bengali commentators on Hotstar always crack me up. Today - ‚ÄúKKR seem to like playing musical chairs with their opening combination, today Rahul, tomorrow Manoj, day after Sanjeev, next day me‚Äù",20
Thampi's on the menu boys.,7
I hope Kuldeep proves his worth in IPL.,6
"So, which over do we think Bairstow's going to get bowled?",4
Thampi Anna.....,6
It's funny to see how both teams fans have already given up on winning the match even when the first innings has literally just started.. come on.. have some faith. Should be a good game.,3
Time to thump thampi,3
"Wow, this Umpire's hair",16
Pashchim Pathak looks like a Tollywood villain with his locks.,8
I hope somebody makes Kuldeep cry today,-5
Third Umpire to Pashchim Pathaks hair: ROLL IT ROLL IT,3
Khaleel is much better than Thampi. Khaleel has 27 wickets in 16 games with 9 economy and Thampi has 16 wickets in 20 games with 9.7 economy.,6
Why is this umpire being so weird lol. He's crouching down while the ball is being bowled,5
"SRH fans : Can we get Bumrah

SRH : no we have Bumrah at home

Bumrah at home : Basil Thampi",8
I wish we could have transferred Ferguson he may not play now as Narine comes back,2
"Yesterday was Robbie, today can we meme gill back to form(that is hitting form in pp)",4
Rashiiiiid the fuck dude,3
Rashid.... :(,3
WTF dropped? It came straight to him,2
Drop :((,3
[Exclusive images of the umpire](https://www.memesmonkey.com/images/memesmonkey/78/78fa8a60aee2f319695a8ced2fd19861.jpeg).,4
"Holy Gill, wtf was that",4
Rashid is the last person I expect to drop a dolly...,5
Russell must be hungry for some blood. Haven't yet had a big inning in IPL.,2
Gill with his usual trick to put the other batsman under pressure,1
He he,2
"Lol, Taher Shah is umpire",4
[removed],5
"We brought QDK back into form , its Russell's time now",6
wtf,2
"How do you drop that?!

No excuse of lost in the lights or anything. That was a sitter",11
"Thampi is encouraging, he seen shit. These won't bother him",8
Rashid's tactical drop to win the purple cap.,8
"Style points = 100

Wicket = 0",1
Tewatia in shambles after seeing the bowler clap,11
"My theory

Even if SRH looses today, they will still be not in that bad a position. 

Loosing to kkr today means getting KKR in form n KKR plays RCB next game.RCB has a game left against MI. 

N RCB's last game is against DC. 

I still cant trust RCB even with 12 points n KKR n SRH may still go through",9
Rashid was distracted by Umpire Pathaks' reshmi julfe,49
This is gonna bite us big in the ass,7
So i just tuned in and looks like we've chosen to lose by electing to field. When you know your team sucks at chasing why do that,5
Gill should not open in T20I until he develops a power game he will be a better fit at No.3,0
Dropped the match,5
"Rashid is such a good fielder , surprised to see him drop a catch that should have been taken . It was still hard but rashid sets the level high in the field .",11
"That should've been taken man, fuck",9
Gill trying to show  I N T E N T  today but please don't give away your wicket to shit shots,14
"Very rarely do you see Rashid drop an easy catch like that, that will cost us heavily",9
Well thampi was decent than I expected huh,9
Send in Cummins already. Need some fun!,3
Excited to see Lockie bowl today.,4
"Lol, Bairstow standing up to 'pace'",6
Do they have a female umpire on one end? Nothing sexist but I cannot figure out the umpire with long hair.,8
Pay Cummins has scored more than Dinesh Karthik this season ...,10
Gill is gonna give his wicket,1
"Had the great fortune of viewing the Hotstar chat section. The first comment I saw on the SRH v KKR match stream: ""Jasprit Bumrah best batsman in the world""",15
"I just want wc  eoin ""slogging Rashid"" morgan today",9
In b4 another 3 4 catches dropped and we see another century,3
These openers bat like it's freaking odi./,8
Pick it up Gill,5
Gill the specialist powerplay waster,7
Gill thinking he is at nets practising and perfecting the cover drive,9
10 minutes into match and SRH fans already reverse jinxing and human sacrificing,11
Why is Gill trying to smack it the ball in the same direction with the same shot ? Take a single or try finding a gap,7
Must bowl out Sandeep in the powerplay,2
Gill has struggled to find the gap this IPL.,7
CEO of Cred?,5
1 boundary in the first 16 balls of the powerplay. Kmon boys :/,5
Rashid will probably make up for that catch while bowling. Idk y but i feel a great day for rashid coming up.,5
Holy shit I will lose my mind if we have another shit powerplay today,9
It just the beginning and 12 years old are already here.,8
Sandeep looking like budget Abbas with an unironically larger budget,0
On tv this ground always just looks like a grandstand in the middle of the desert,3
">I would love to see some Bairstow and Priyam Garg swapping exchanging their batting order because Priyam Garg is a class player and given a chance at top of the order, he might prove himself, and also Bairstow has the firepower to finish the innings. We have seen such batting changes for CSK-RR-KXIP

-cricbuzz 

Remind where the 3 mentioned teams are on the points table",4
Tuk tuk,3
Alteast Narine wouldn't have wasted balls /s,3
When will KKR start utilizing Powerplays?,3
"I don't like Gill and I don't like his batting. Its slow. He lacks power and while he looks good hitting medium pacers, he struggles against genuine pace.  
Add his lazy running btw the wickets and disrespect towards umpires (did that in the Ranji afaik) and all we have is a spoilt brat. Kambli 2.0",7
Sehwag was right,3
Bruh we need to pick up pace . These low run rate powereplays really hurt our innings,2
Yet another shit powerplay. How come McCullum doesn't work on this! These powerplay are so unlike his style!,4
How did I never notice this stadium was literally built on a desert lmao,3
The openers have no option but to go for it now. Chance of a wicket falling!,2
"Lmao y‚Äôall srh management isn‚Äôt that dumb. They know they are a defending team, that‚Äôs why they chose to bat every other time they won the toss. There has to be a reason we don‚Äôt know of for bowling first",3
3 runs in a powerplay over. And I woke up at 6 am on a Sunday to watch this. F off KKR.,10
NATUUU,1
"Big fan of him but

Now gill has started getting in my nerves

Common man play some shots in pp ffs",6
Sandeep Sharma is a revelation all these years in IPL.. least pace among all bowlers but the accuracy and skill to move the ball has been always top class..,2
"Michael Jackson to umpire : ""ye me karleta hoo tabtak ap dream 11 par team bana lo""


T: let me do this, till then you make your team on dream 11",1
[deleted],5
Nattu,2
Hot Take - Inconsistent Shaw > Consistent Gill                               In T20s,7
Why is the umpire crouching as if looking for a run out LMAO!!,5
Loving the tache,3
Do the coaching staff not tell the players what is they have been doing wrong the past few games?,2
Tripathi the messiah,5
Gill not even attempting to hit a boundary..wtf!!,3
S M O K E D,1
"Poor Nattu , second ball six",3
One of these two teams will be the 4th team to qualify,2
Bruh who is this umpire,6
I think KKR should try Narine and Tripathi opening partnership when Narine comes back,2
[removed],-1
Rashid with the tactical drops.... Noice,2
I didn't know IPL had female umpires,3
That umpire looks like Tommy Wiseau,3
Play Lad in place of Shubman. #jinx,1
Our bowling lineup is the biggest bluffer on the planet. We are so incredibly bad without Bhuvi. They can just ignore Rashid and target the rest.,3
"Wait, the umpire is a man? I thought it was a woman!",6
Can batsmen object to umpire's long hair as distractive? Lol.,6
Is it a new umpire at the bowler's end? Haven't seen him before,4
Nat reminds me of Vaas.,3
Bairstow shaved???,5
Finally have a few female umpires getting the stage. Good stuff!,2
Happy to see Basil Thampi back,7
Gill auditioning for the test side yet again.,10
"Gill, please leave the Thala Academy!",11
Can someone please clarify if the umpire is a lady?? I just can't tell and it's killing me...,3
"Why are people shitting on the umpire . He didn't give any wrong decisions yet and as far as crouching goes , he probably feels comfortable that way.",4
Long hair umpire is a guy right?,7
"Gill tripathi

Playing like indian warner bairstow of this season",2
Pandey ji you're playing for SRH not Manchester United,1
Am i too late for the umpire jokes.,11
"What have the 6s been called over the years? I remember DLF maximum, Hero maximum and now Unacademy cracking six but I can‚Äôt remember the rest",6
"Gill has a strike rate of 50 after facing 12 balls
:(",5
5D chess by Rashid.. he knew Gill is more valuable to SRH winning by staying on the wicket than getting out..,15
My coach would abuse me for kicking the ball.. respect!!,3
Srh should have gone for Abhishek Sharma over samad,8
[deleted],54
Are Gill & Paddikal buddies ?,9
Feel like Gill is a timing guy. He‚Äôs timing to take KKR to a loss,5
"Lmao umpire bringing meaning to the phrase *""Could you rock n roll that please""*",15
Looks like the umpire is also wicket keeping,8
"This umpire probably has the best LBW decision record, that level of concentration on every ball",6
"Shubhman ""future of indian cricket"" gill has an s/r of around 50 in a T20  
If this is the future of Indian cricket, well we should start focusing on soccer",4
Ravi Bishnoi for Emerging player of the year. DP comes close second. Gill might not have won this year.,10
7(13) is only acceptable if you're batting like the Universe Boss or the bowling is like MI,10
I think Gill and Paddikal would be our openers one day in limited overs format,6
"This KKR and SRH teams are very well matched. Slow starts. Weak bowling attacks.

Well balanced match.",3
"Is this son in law‚Äôs only boundary today? An edge?

E: nvm",6
Gill showing Intent‚Ñ¢,3
You've been hit by you've been stuck by ..... a smooth umpire,7
That's the only way Gill could have got a boundary today.,3
"Even if Gill played a run a ball, the RR would look fine. A SR of 50 for an opener in a T20 game is shambolic! 
He is perfect for the red ball format though!",4
The umpire looks like every Indian school's music teacher lol,36
I will take the Gill boundary however it comes,4
Thampi has got decent pace,2
Its kinda sad seeing guys like tripati play well in the ipl knowing that he'll probably never make it into the national side,3
Was Gill always this conservative? He played mostly in the middle overs last season but wasn't this slow off the block. He's wasting precious PP overs.,1
Guys keep bullying gill it's working,13
Thampi is back guys.,9
Thampi is back,7
Thampi is back!!,5
Never been more disinterested in SRH bowling ever.,7
Sr jumps from 50 to 100,2
Thampi on a mission to break his previous record,1
Shit we memed gill into form?? Keep going,10
KKR might have the lowest strike rate v length deliveries but why the fuck are so low too? Bairstow-Warner combination must be taken into reconsideration.,2
Yeah Thampi sucks.,3
Thampi getting thamped,5
After shitting on him hits three 4s nice,4
"Reminder that Shubman Gill got into a spat with this same umpire earlier this year:
https://thesportsrush.com/shubman-gill-abuses-umpire-in-ranji-trophy-before-delhi-players-walk-off-the-ground-in-mohali/",3
Thamped,3
Why u bowling short to gill,3
Sigh,3
Is it too early to praise r/Cricket ?,7
Aaaaand that's the thampi we know,6
"Damn that's a good shot, reminded of that shot by Kohli against wi last year",4
"Everyone shitting on Gill, he plays like how Gambhir & Kohli do; anchor and play at a brisk pace. But he lacks the aggressive intent. But he is still young, so he will improve that aspect.",5
"Gill: Anyway, I started blasting.",8
Khaleel must be enjoying this.. got left out for no fault of his.,16
Gill has finally picked it up,5
"Ipl 2020 Random stat: if you drop catch of someone, they will go on and smash atleast a fifty against you.",9
*We are fucked*,3
So who is going to start that Gill apology thread?,0
Gill is reading this thread somehow,8
Wait till teams finally realise after this match exactly how shit we are without Bhuvi and Marsh.,13
"Well , when is IPL 2021?",14
So Gill gives it back to r/cricket,7
Finally the gill that was promised.,4
"4 4 4

Now tell me he is the worst opener",-1
I don't trust gill. Usually when he plays like this he usually slows down again or get out,5
Gill is Kohli lite.,5
Yes it is time to encash on the Thampi->Thumped jokes guys,12
"We've brought Gill into form. And enough with the Rashid is a great fielder trope, he often drops sitters.",25
r/Cricket being shit as usual.,10
[removed],27
Lord Thampi,6
Not now Basil,4
Now r/cricket will shit on thampi and bring him to form,7
"after 3 boundaries he's still at 20(17)  
if T20 is an exam, he barely has pass marks but watch the commentary team cream in their pants at the sight of son-in-law",4
We could‚Äôve used Thampi in our match against SRH.,5
Wtf are these shitty puns. Gill Skill? How about Shubman Sgill? Bring me back the days where we had shit like Brad and Butter when Hogg was batting,5
"r/cricket meming an underfire player into form.

Some things never change even in 2020.",7
"Good teams have 6-7 quality bowling options they can use. They can be innovative and properly tinker with the combination. 

Shit teams like ours have 4 bowlers and part-time bowlers.",3
"Rashid Khan drops an absolute soda off Basil's bowling of the same batsman Gill and now the poor bowler is getting blamed.

He didn't even overreact or do a Tewatia when the drop happened. Took it in his stride and moved on. Here's hoping he bounces back strong",23
Gill is the worst player in history.  Many players have hit 3 boundaries so what?,-4
Gill is overrated. Like Shaw.,6
Basil ~~Thampi~~ Thumping‚Ñ¢,5
Thampi has literally done nothing for SRH in the 5-6 games he's played,4
Give Shankar the bowl ffs. At least you can get some overs out of him.,4
Srh take gill leave tripathi,0
Shubman Gill needs to sort out his power game.  It was noted in earlier matches as well that he is not using his top hand (left hand) and shoulder properly and wasting a lot of power.,3
Which team winning is better for kxip? Having a hard time figuring it out,0
If Whitehat was not enough now we have Coding Ninjas,3
"Saving two overs of sandy

Uh oh",5
Morgan so happy,2
You already know this umpire will struggle from artheritis in the future,4
"If not retained by KKR, how much do you think Gill will earn in an open IPL auction?",5
[deleted],10
What's a good score to defend here?,1
[deleted],0
[deleted],4
Why the umpire is standing like a slip fielder,12
Warnie needs to fire his stylist for that moustache,7
Is that umpire male guys? That thing there is distracting mah boi nattu,6
With Bhuvi out RCB has a better attack than SRH,9
"Wait, what happened to Yorker Natarajan?",6
Told ya all bullying gill will work,9
Kohlisque,2
Kkr should now score around the 190 mark,4
KKR scoring runs in powerplay. *tears of joy*,5
hair grooming training session needed for the umpire‚Äôs slash hair and natrajan neck beard,12
Quick question- why don‚Äôt bowlers bowl more Yorkers at the start of the innings/middle overs? Is it just the risk that it comes off as a low full toss and there aren‚Äôt enough people at the boundary?,5
Looks like you guys have memed the intent into Gill.,5
We need to stop bashing Gill for his strike rate.....it is better for him to play as the anchor and stay there rather than lose his wicket this early in the game.,10
I can not understand why we didn‚Äôt bat first.,2
1 more thampi over pls,2
"Neutrals, which team are you supporting for the 4th place: SRH or KKR?",2
If KKR can score more runs than SRH then I think that they will win this match.,23
Everyone's a gangsta until this umpire starts shredding a guitar solo mid game,84
"Gill doesnt hit 

What an useless piece of shit he his

Gill hits boundaries

He is just hitting mediocre bowlers. What an useless piece of shit he is.",6
Umpire is a guy? A woman? Or üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà,5
How does banton and Phillipe bat are they any good they are the most hyped players of their nations that I have seen.,1
Gill: I'd like to thank r/cricket for memeing me into form!!,13
"Gill was struggling, got a top edge, got a boundary, started playing beautifully after that. Funny how these things work",8
Looks like tactical drop of Gill backfired.,13
That catch gonna cost us this match.,7
Random thought- The umpire would be a great ambassador for WhiteHat the contrast would be vivid and guys will remember the WhiteHat,3
Fuckn West Indies commentators do that job with the most sincerity,14
Please shut up Swanny,0
GONEEE,0
Jaffa,-1
Nattu.... You beauty.,1
Nattu!!!!,2
Let‚Äôs goo,7
NATTUUU,3
"Gone, no celebration. Damage has been done. Hope we keep getting wickets",7
Awful shot,2
"**5.6** Natarajan to Tripathi, OUT, **swipes across the line and loses his stumps.** **48-1**

RA Tripathi  b Natarajan 23 (16b 2x4 1x6) SR: 143.75",1
Good guy Natrajan. Sent tripathi back to get his medical attention,5
Ofcourse we had to drop a wicket in the powerplay ffs!,2
Jungleee!,-1
Tripathi did his job,5
"Tripathi: *writhing in pain*

Swann : Ah, the Altroz",19
"When everyone was winning the toss and opting to field, Warner elected to bat vs KKR (and lost)

Now that everyone opts to bat first, Warner elected to field vs KKR",12
This is still one of our best Power Play performance! That's the funny part,10
"Oh man , Nattu strikes needed Tripathi to play a longer one here",2
David's fav song playing lol,2
Letzoooo,1
Pressure nahi kuch nahi hamko to bat ghumana h...,1
Please don't send Karthik. Rashid will be all over him#jinx,5

NATTU,1
Warner going to start dancing soon because of this music,5
Need back to back wickets now,2
"Rana please perform today, his form has been poor lately",7
Traffic is too slow taday,1
"Shankar in, can‚Äôt wait to see 6 wickets fall this over",8
"Send Cummins in, he wants that 100",4
Can someone please get Natarajan to shave his beard??,6
3D is on bois,4
What song was playing?,2
Time for my 3D glasses,5
Swann doesn't go easy („Éª‚àÄ„Éª),10
I can‚Äôt believe that KKR are 7/48 (7) after that 6 wicket Shankar over.,2
Shankar and Thampi should be mentioned in KKR‚Äôs playing 11 I guess.,1
Swann üòÅ,7
"Wtf, swanny roasted Warner with sandpaper joke",12
Wow Swannn just roasted Warnerr,10
Low fucking blow Swanny,6
Enough with the sandpaper jokes,5
Swanny with the sandpaper bantz,21
Swann you muppet,11
What's with the 3d jokes,2
"Wait I just tuned in, did Bairstow shave??",5
Shots fired by Swann,18
"RANA - Karthik - Russell win get out in 6 overs.

Same script everyday.",7
"Swann spews so much BS but it really adds a lot to the dugout, hates Warner with a passion tho",39
Did Bairstow shave?,1
Swanny again keeping it real in the dugout.,10
"Tripathi got sa strain in his hands before the dismissal delivery. That's why he couldn't time the ball properly, and got bowled.",8
Bro Natarajan needs to visit a saloon,14
vacchadayo swami,8
What did Swann say?Not watching Dugout,3
"Gill in the post match conference today ""Intent is very very overrated""",6
Shankar lulling batsmen into a false sense of security by bowling pies.,8
Ouch that might have hurt bad.,3
Just when i thought i could trust gill his strike rate is back to 100,8
3 dot balls against 3D? That's shitty batting. May be just rotate the strike?,8
Lol they added Hyderabad chants to the same drumbeat üôÉ,8
Imagine a Shankar maiden over.üôÑ,7
Guys y'all need to troll Gill again üôÉ,8
Oh my Gosh Swann is going to get into trouble with Warner and Australia now....,5
Lmao it‚Äôs Shankar ffs,3
Gill quite lucky today,3
Village fielding,7
4 balls 4 dots. 3D,4
"Keep an eye out for Warner sanding the ball off with his moustache. 

That dude has no chill.",4
Such a sketchy innings from gill and he's still almost at only a run a ball.,3
I so hate Natarajan's beard,14
"I'd prefer if Gill did not use a KKR game as a net session to show his worth to the Indian Test Team.  
...but then, son-in-law privileges I guess",-1

"I'd prefer if Gill did not use a KKR game as a net session to show his worth to the Indian Test Team.  
...but then, son-in-law privileges I guess",14
Is this 150-165 run pitch?,2
Gill with all the luck ...98 ball 100 incoming,20
Good over by 3D,9
Village,2
"Gill is thala lite lmao 

Chad Hitting 4 dot balls then a boundary >>> virgin rotating the strike",51
"Shankar bowling to Gill is the movable object coming against the stoppable force.

Total mediocrity all around.",5
Did KKR just give Banton one game and then bin him off again?,9
Pujara seems like a good option now when compared to Shubman.,11
Warner  looks like that pornstar who kinda looks like Dr Disrespect,9
Oh my this current gill reminds of 2008 kohli,4
Gill's playstyle is similar to which other opening batsmen?,2
Rashid dropped Gill on purpose,10
"As if the Josh ads weren't cringe enough, Jacqueline Fernandes makes it even more cringy!",11
Don't think Bangar was getting what Swann was alluding to with that Sand falling off elbow joke.,11
[deleted],19
Swanny‚Äôs going for a wicket alert,3
"Gill will probably end up like Rahane in T20s, good asset for any team to open the innings and bat in 120s but will never be a match winner himself",6
Poll is not giving you the correct option obviously it is Cummins,5
"lmao all these other coaches of other are writing essays, meanwhile VVS and Muttiah just sit there looking like grandparents watching the colony matches",92
"Lol, why the hate for Shankar. Dude hasn't done anything wrong till now in the match",10
Rana going out again at a duck,2
"What's with the son in law privilege with Gill.

Out of the loop",5
Where is kane? I can't find him anywhere,7
 gill has played too many balls to fielders maybe bowlers are figuring out his game .,6
Umpire ladka hai ya ladki?,4
Who has played the lost dot balls this season? Bet Gill should be there in the top 5.,3
Dhoni needs to stop influencing these youngsters with his tips,19
Swann and Dominic Cork are a shit partnership. Constantly trying to speak over each other. Fuckers need to shut the fuck up once in a while too.,9
For a left hander rana is not that good against leggies.,7
Dugout is basically /r/Cricket as a show,25
"Ok gotta say I like this gill dude 

Like it takes balls to just say fuck off and start practicing for ODI in a T20 match",29
Gill and 100 strike rate is like rice on sushi,6
Nice save by 3D boi,4
That umpire's hairdo is wiiiild,6
"The fact that Gill's FC average is 70 just shows the weakness of the Indian FC system.  
Filled with medium pacers and pace bowlers who are generally overbowled and then become medium pacers.  
This guy being the future of ANYTHING is such a laughable concept",-1
Warner looks like a cross between a mid level officer in the East Indian company and a B-list  bogan pornstar.,13
Gill to score a 100 today after Gabbar?,10
You guys wanna bully rana into form?,15
Pls spare 1-2 overs of Rashid for Russell and Morgan. That‚Äôs the game plan.,10
3D about to give 30.,6
"Bangar has been silent for two overs now because Cork and Swann won't shup up about some random bullshit.  2 chutiya poms in one commentary box is too much for an Indian audience, I suppose.",6
Shankar with a bouncer,4
"Rana u suck

Now gib me boundaries",7
Pretty much the two most boring teams of IPL this season.,14
What‚Äôs happened to Vihari this IPL?,6
The only run rana has is in his name,8
Warner should leave the template and finish off 3D and Samads 4 over quota ASAP,8
"Dude, if you ducking even at 3D's short balls, then you are really fucked against other teams.",4
I'm going to sleep üò¥,4
"Rana seems to have eaten his twin during the lockdown.  
Gill is Gill  
If Russell doesn't fire this team is F U C K E D",5
"Rana just hit a boundary 
Then again it was against vijay Shankar",8
KKR the only team this IPL not to have a 50+ opening stand. *sighs*,8
"Cork is way too intense and takes himself too seriously. Swanny is a troll. 

Excellent idea to put them together.",9
"Net run rate is also part of the batriarchy.

Fuck cricket.",7
How did DC lose NRR then last night?,5
Man the gill hate boner is strong here,7
Remember when 3D boi lbw'ed Imam Ul Haq in the Wc,22
[deleted],8
Cummins for #4,6
I think Gill completed his bachelors at the college of Tuk Tuk.,22
Altroz,2
"That hairstyle in Middle east heat, kudos to the umpire...",15
Gill about get a 100 SR century.,7
Looks like 3D is the replacement for Bhuvi /s,18
Now time out,1
Cork must be the only person who hasn't yet caught on to Swanny trolling that car's marketing.,15
"Shankar 2 overs and 12 runs,crazy",9
"IPL in UAE has exposed all the domestic flat track and small ground, domestic bowler bullies. Players with a real power game who can perform irrespective of ground size and conditions are showing their worth.",31
This is just too boring.,5
"Alright lads time to hit the gym, and when i say gym i mean the park cuz we are in lockdown. 

Be nice to each other ye cunts.",3
"That Hindi commentary on rahuls wicket, 'pehle upar daala, fir piche, aur finally length pe' lmao",17
Gill has the energy of khwaja,5
Shubman running is as weak as his batting.,3
"Gill can either be Virat or Rohit, the choice is his",6
"The only team that can make Shankar and Siraj look good.
KKR!",16
[here's koach for no reason at all. ](https://i.imgur.com/PvEwtIu.jpg),0
Once again we are gonna crawl to 150-160 somehow. Fuck this batting lineup,8
"Lol both the batsmen are playing run a ball 

This is not only bad but also not fun to watch",8
Gill got admitted into Thala‚Äôs tuition during lockdown.,15
Two of the lowest supported teams here. Doubt we would get more than 3500 comments in this thread,21
"Gill needs less cricket and more nutrition, looks like he's well below UN's minimum nutritional standards",4
"Once we used to have good tight bowling lineup, defended 140,130 scores. now every over I am praying that they don't give 10 runs. 

Bhuvi, Mitch Marsh in the team would have been different ,now every fast bowler has same variation, pace , length. If batsman comfortable with one bowler then they can play any fast bowler",10
Half the comments here are about umpireüòÇ.,8
The orange cap needs to have a caveat of minimum 130 strike rate.,8
It's a pity we haven't yet been treated to the spectacle of VJ Shankar bowling to De Villiers.,6
Kanos ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,2
"If Gill was a car he would be a gold Tata Altroz.

Slow, flashy, and overhyped in this IPL.",16
No narine no party. Suck it kkr. Srh will win this with 10 wickets.,3
32(30) is this even a T20 ?,8
We need big overs tuk tuk gill do something,5
Is Warner trusting 3D to complete quota? Why Rashid now?,8
If Gill has been slow it's only because KKR is woefully inept and didn't tell him it's a T20.,16
"Not every player is built for T20s, Gill is still pretty young but he currently does not have the game for T20s. Will have to work on that.",6
"lots of mediocre domestic indian players in both these teams. 
no wonder they're sitting in the middle of the table.",9
Gill is a puzzle. He gets runs at least but the strike rate puts pressure on middle order.,2
So we can agree that kkr and kxip bring opposition players back in form??,4
Imagine not playing jason holder.,17
I think Cheteshwar pujara can play the same role as Gill. He should have an IPL contract.,3
We really need Abhishek Sharma to improve his bowling and be able to fire that quicker delivery into the pads. We're really missing a Krunal/Jadeja/Axar-type of player.,8
"Gill needs to get out, if KKR has to win this. His job is done.",0
Harsha conducting the hr interview of holder.,7
Why is everyone suddenly hitting Rashid?,7
I wish we could play holder in that middle order.,3
"Gill is a proper CSK player with that s/r  
Thala, please show us your coolness and advise your owners (from behind the wicket of course! as you usually do) and take this NPA off our hands",-1
"After the tewatia incident, rashid became mediocre",3
That's a shitty over from Rashid.,7
RIP bowling average.,4
Why do we bring every out of form batsman into form?,9
Looks like Rashid gonna fuck up today,5
Hmm... Even Rashid is getting hit for runs.,6
"SR is overrated list :

Rahul (founder)

Smith

Rana 

Gill

Thala 

Jadhav 

Anymore names ?",9
Can someone comment pic of that umpire who looks like Michael Jackson pls. I'm not seeing him and the excitement is killing me. Thanks.,6
10 ball Rana > 30 ball Gill.,8
"Alright, data so far shows that Rana is about to get out any minute now",8
"Ab yehi baaki reh gya tha, rashid bhi parsaad baant rha",3
Just save the Rashid overs and stop bowling him in desperation. Cool him down for 2-3 overs.,7
KKR treating Rashid like Shankar and vice versa.,13
Rashid someone fucks up against left handers and watto,2
Tewatia broke SRH's spirit.,12
Gill needs to make up his mind he either go 130+ SR or go 100- strike rate to make it to CSK,5
"We paid 8 Cr for Holder/Braithwaite one time I think ,who was benched half the season",6
"Kanos and Ranveer, two entirely different people in same ad lol",6
I have become a shit poster because of Gill. Shut me up Gill.,4
The hdfc ad is legit the worst ad in the tournament,-1
With such performances gill can never make the T20 squad. He scores runs but he doesn't make an impact,2
Umpire has lockdown hair since before lockdown was a thing.,4
"Swann is almost mocking altroz in a subtle British way.

 Oh my God, look at this altroz I would throw my child and pregnant wife into war torn syria just to get one test ride in Indias most safest vehicle ever created.",10
3D boi bowling with better economy than Rashid today,3
Gill surely has to take on Shankar this over.,4
Jason Holder has Richie Richardson's smarts and Gayle's charisma.,1
Rahul dravid's cardekho ad is pure r/watchpeopledieinside material right there.,6
"Rana and Tripathi have scored at about the same rate , which is well above 150 SR ,Gill here has struggled to keep up the 100 SR",4
Bruh how you miss a 120 kmph bouncer,4
Who is keeping wickets for SRH today? Can't seem to recognize the bloke..,4
"Shubman Gill's post Powerplay stats:

In overs 7-12 this IPL

76 balls

87 runs

Four dismissals

SR 119.5

This is really bad, even for an anchor",6
YJB looks like his grandfather without that Ginger beard.,3
Hitting Rashid fine but can't hit Shankar lol.,5
"Ok gill, hit or get out",6
Yooo Gill. Please don't become a liability this match.,9
Gill needs to work on his finishing intent,2
A man who cant play a 3d vijay shankar ball is the FUTURE apparently!,1
Fucking hell Gill,2
"3D can‚Äôt hear us right?
What happened to him?",1
Srh have to show why they went with 3 foreign batsman today.,1
When Lord Shankar is more economical than Rashid this game,1
"Is Holder a fast bowler (as in an above 140kph)? Also, is there a website where you can check a bowlers pace? Asking this as it‚Äôs clear that SRH need some variation in their indian fast bowling all of them are 130-140.",3
Why is Gill batting straight into 3D's hands,5
Hyderabad shouldn't get Gill out,6
Hit wicket man. This is just irritating,4
"Oh my 3d bowling well, better finish his quota now.",4
"FFS, what is this clown doing?",2
"Gill is a very frustrating player. Because you know the talent is there, just taking tok loo long right now.",4
"Too much pressure is put on Rashid. 

If other bowlers don‚Äôt take a wicket in an over, they say it‚Äôs no big deal and focus on the next. With Rashid, if he doesn‚Äôt take a wicket and gives 6+, he‚Äôll take it as a failure. Because he knows there isn‚Äôt anyone else in the middle overs reliable enough to take wickets.",6
"These two have definitely missed a trick here, as soon as Rashid came on to bowl one of them should‚Äôve left a straight one so Morgan can get out there and play his favourite game of twatting him into the stands over and over again.",6
This is painful to watch,3
Gill needs to get out. Man can‚Äôt time even after playing out the complete day 1 of a test match,5
Gill needs to be replaced by Cummins.,7
"again 3 dot balls to 3D! WTF is this!

How come Baz does not say anything?",5
"Jesus Gill, if youre not going to tru and hit, atleast get 6 in the over.",7
Gill playing like Shankar in Nidahas final.,10
Shubhman man. Poor timing evey fucking ball. How?,7
A wicket now can cost SRH this match.,10
Don't forget that Dhoni's best performance this season still is Khatabook ad,2
As a sunrisers fan please don't get gill out,3
Gill struggling vs Shankar slower balls proves that technique is so so so overrated in T20s. A power hitter like Pollard/Russel/Pandya?Stoinis wouldve tonked him all over,8
Gill sucks,2
"Can't hit a full toss, after playing 30 balls. Pathetic from Gill.",3
"Vijay Shankar is channeling the spirits of Adam Dale and Gavin Larsen.

Bowling pies and yet not conceding shit.",1
Need some technique tune ups for Shubhman for t20. But we all know whats tha done for Rahul and Gambhir so idk if that is worth it.,1
Love how this sub shits on both Gill and 3D at the same time rather than appreciating 3D,12
"If he wants to play an anchor role he has to do better at rotating the strike, he takes up so many dot balls.",1
Why is there a csk-umpires conspiracy post sitting with 30 upvotes? Facebook leaking,2
Which team would like to have ABD other than RCB in IPL?,-5
Who is the rockstar of the umpire with the long hair?,3
Rashid is smiling somewhere after dropping the catch,3
To much respect shown to Vijay shankar,2
Ngl this games have been pretty uneventful so far,3
Shankar has better economy than Rashid üò±,3
Gill please get out,1
"Finally saw kane mama, good stop. Saved 3 runs",3
"WTF, is today 3D's Day?",1
"Russell s only playing 5 balls today, isnt he?",1
Shankar>>>>Rashid,3
Now I understand the genius of Rashid to drop shubman pujara,3
"Gotta feel for the lad. Can't even hit a knee high full toss at 120kmph. Trying to overhit hit and absolutely no timing. 

Kinda similar to Padikkal's 35(37) yest",2
Lord Shankar!,1
Can somebody get Gill out. Please.,2
Bowl Samad now.,1
Mm ...vijay shankar is out best bowler now.,2
What a snooze fest for a sunday afternoon,2
No wickets pls!,1
Shankar is bowling better than rashid. 2020 nothing else,1
[removed],-2
rash did the right thing by dropping that catch,2
Gill doing a Thala Dhoni+ Jadhav,2
That's a massive shot for Gill. Respect,3
Take a risk with a part-timer like Samad. Or bring back one of your regular bowlers.,3
Rashid leaking and 3D keeping tight. What timeline is this,8
Umpire looks like snape.,2
Lara absolutely shitting on Gill's technique,2
Surely KKR should retire Gill,0
"What a shit shot from rana

Edit :- fuck me he hit a 6",1
Gill is just pissed that Altroz is known as India's safest hatchback and not him.,10
"Rashid with the gamechanger moment TM of the game so far.

When he dropped Gill.",5
Rana anna.,2
"Rana wtf, please",2
"The worst thing that can happen to Gill is he ruins his technique to get better at clearing the ropes. I'm not one to demand players do anything, their careers choices are purely their own but I hope he gives first class and test cricket priority for the foreseeable future.",7
why tf would u reverse sweep rashid khan,1
Rashid‚Äôs getting bonked today,3
RASHID getting destroyed,1
"Gill needs to be dropped for 2 games. 

Unless he tewatia thi inning",1
Use the fuckin part-timer.,3
"Leg spinner to a left handed batsman, bad idea.",1
Rana can't even play leg spin properly and he is tonking Rashid all around.,6
Legspinner to left handed batsmen bad idea,2
Give gill the strike and tell him to hit it long ffs,0
Baz should sub in for gill to show him how it's done,0
"The sad part is gill is the highest run scorer for kkr, imagine these many balls given to Cummins, he would have the orange cap",5
"Rashid conceding sixes and 3D keeping it tight

2020 what have you done",6
"Just tuned in, who's this umpire fella with crazyy hair?",1
Stanlake would have been good vs Rana.,2
Rashid getting hit for fours and sixes feels like a personal attack,5
Pretty sure our win record is shit when Rashid goes at 8 RPO or higher.,3
Who the fuck is this umpire?,2
What's up with rashid? Why is he bowling full,1
Me after listening to Lara on dugout *Gillman bc use your top hand*,2
Shankar bowling like Rashid and Rashid like Shankar!!,1
That umpire is a proper hippie,2
Yesterday DDP today Gill,1
We are the most predictable team in the tournament.,2
Why the hell is the umpire crounching like that?,3
[deleted],3
FINALLY!!!! YAAASSSS LET'S GO,2
Pathetic and selfish inning.,6
Damn that was a good catch,3
SRH just lost the match.,7
What a CATCH,3
Garg winning match for Kkr with that catch.,4
"Priyam you Beauty, spectacular catch. One of the best in this IPL",2
When is the the next kkr vs rcb because I really wanna see siraj vs gill: unstoppable force vs immovable force.,6
NOOOOO GARG WHAT IS U DOING BBY,2
"Has lord tewatia shook off rashid's confidence

Last game watto n rayudu took him on

Now rana",3
Gill did his job for SRH,8
Finally a miserable innings comes to an end,2
Garg is a great foelder,4
"Well, Gill‚Äôs gone, KKR would be happy",14
Padikkalesque innings,7
why rashid?? why you do this??,3
YESSSSS!! Get fuxxed,2
Thank God!,3
"What have you done SRH? 
It‚Äôs done and it costs you this match",2
"Priyam Garg, the CEO of taking tough catches but dropping sitters",11
Holy fuck that catch,1
Thank you for getting out Gill,2
too much effort for that catch wtf,3
Sunrisers just lost the match with that wicket,6
Lmao and they say KKR gonna end up in the top 2,2
KKR fans celebrating more than SRH fans,8
"Fuck you, Shubman.",3
Why take Gill's wicket? Excellent work by Garg tho.,5
Gill needs to get dropped man,2
Lambe ghane bal has the 90s six signal.,7
Can't even hit Vijay Shankar he tried to take on Rashid.,8
Not even celebrating that great catch once he realized it was Gill.,40
continues to blow me away how clear KG is on the purple cap list,10
What a catch Priyamüî•,6
Pag is so confused.. did I just take that?,8
Get Russell in now!,6
Run a ball 36 after getting a life is pathetic. Thank god this guy is not in reckoning for Team India spot,8
36 (37) is a match losing innings from Gill. Horrific SR throughout and decided to take on Rashid after doing tuk-tuk with Shankar?? Brain dead batting,9
"He always good fielder, Priyam Garg. Chinna Pandey",4
Why couldn‚Äôt he have gotten out like 3 overs ago!,5
They sent Russell early,5
Ooooo.... RUSSEL MUSCLE is here.,3
What kind of THALA ACADEMY INNINGS was that.,6
"Another statpadding innings by Gill with a ridiculous SR.. sorry, but for me Tripathi is the better opener for KKR who gets it moving in power play.",6
"I have a crazy idea. Only play two off kane, Warner and Jhonny and play Holder at 4.

Want more assurance, open with Rashid, and ask Warner to bat at 3 and Manish at 4.

Jhonny, Rashid, Warner, Manish, Garg, Samad, Abhishek/ 3D, Holder/Nabi, Nadeem, Natarajan, Sandeep/ Thampi",1

DaNgErOuS sHUbHMan gILL,5
Beautiful catch,1
Did Russel just bolt in?,1
And this guy is Kohli's SuCeSsOr,5
hope this match will be less boring now,2
That excellent catch kicked the sleep out of me.,2
"Warner homie, I know this will Rashid confidence but plz save his last over for Russell and Morgan.",4
"Rana playing out Vijay Shankar and attacking Rashid, wth.",3
Dangerous shubhman gill? Is the commentator high?,4
Big loss for SRH,2
All Indian youngsters doing tuk tuk for an opening Test XI slot,5
Dangerous Shubhman Gill? Wot are you smoking Bangar?,3
Thank you Priyam Garg ‚ù§Ô∏è,2
Gets the *dangerous* shubman gill on 36. Yeah sure,6
'Dangerous shubman gill' ?????!?!!!! Are we watching the same game Bangar,10
"Anyone gets dropped: scores a 50

Gill: we don't do that here",3
"KKR experiments with the batting order in every single match, and then wonder why they don't fire.

They've been sending Morgan, Karthik, Russell randomly around this point.",8
"**11.4** Rashid Khan to Shubman Gill, OUT, **taken at long-off.** Garg sprinting and lunging to his left. Good length and pushed through at off stump. Looks to go inside-out and can't open the wrists well enough. It's flat and about waist height as Garg tracks it closely and takes it under his eyes **87-2**

Shubman Gill c Garg b Rashid Khan 36 (37b 5x4 0x6) SR: 97.29",3
Why do they have to show Varun C as 22nd on the purple cap list,3
Whose win will affect RCB more?,2
Surprised not to see Morgan. Have they forgotten that he ripped Rashid apart at the WC,9
I like Gill as a batsman but his approach in the past few matches has been anti-T20 and will hurt his chances in the near future unless he changes something.,11
Have teams ever tried to deliberately keep a struggling player in the middle to prevent more dangerous players from batting?,3
Padikal and Gill both need to have a different dimension to their game once the powerplay is over.,3
Russel/Cummins/DK needs a blitzkrieg of an innings.,2
Lara dismantled Gill's technique so thoroughly one would think Gill was dating his daughter instead of Tendulkar's.,74
So is srh bringing back russell to form?,5
"Great catch by Garg to get rid of the sad sack of potatoes (who for legal reasons, is known as Shubhman Gill)  
Go hang out with Pujara or something.",5
Tuk Tuk Academy is flourishing this year.,8
Teaches SRH not to drop catches or they'll be made to pay by a hearty run-a-ball 36,5
"It made sense for KL to do this anchor thing, because apart from 2 other players, his team suck. But there's no reason for a KKR opener to do so. They are packed.",7
That‚Äôs two days in a row that someone‚Äôs taking a genuinely impressive diving catch in the deep and gotten absolutely zero initial reaction from commentary...,8
At the start of the season I saw comments here that actually said Gill is better than Kohli.,3
"Rashid v Russel, interesting match up",2
Rashid saved his team at least 20 runs by dropping Gill earlier.,6
Garg should have played 4d chess and dropped it,0
"If Russell gets his form too, I‚Äôm done",5
SRH need to win today. Otherwise the top 4 will be the current top 4 teams. Gap will become too much for the other teams to bridge.,5
Gill be like score run per ball every match and eat away like 25-30% of the inning no matter how the pitch is,1
That ump got some style,3
Russell already? Dear god why. we are fucked.,6
should have dropped it priyam.,3
I have the gut feeling that Russell is back to his scary 2019 form and is going to absolutely smash us,8
Morgan should have come in,3
Shouldn't Morgan come to anchor?,5
Priyam Garg looks like a very young VVS,6
Cmon bois don't get Russell into form ffs,3
"Shubman Gill, maybe Shubman Tendulkar in the future, but played like Shubman Thala today.",5
Why are people scrutinising Gill so much and calling him Thala academy recruit? It would far worse if he did this in the last 10 overs. He gave his team a stable start. That‚Äôs what counts.,10
Gill is truly the second coming of Rahane lol. Played a match losing innings in the name of being an anchor and people justifying his wicket by saying power game is not his natural game lol,10
Is 36(37) the worst score t20 for an opener?,9
"Srh is the best ground fielding team this year and all the lads look hella fit, if not for pandey and rashid's catching they'd be the best fielding team full stop.",5
"Rabada being top on the wicket taker list :-

*Nothing can stop me, i'm all the way up*",7
Stop calling Bangar as banger lmao,10
Throw Samad an over. Pls Warner take a chance against Russell instead of relying on our medium pacers.,2
This is one really stacked batting lineup if everyone even moderately clicks.,3
"Shubman is overhyped AF in IPL! 

He seems to be more of an ODI player.",5
I have a feeling Russell will get out within 2 overs.,2
What's with all the youngsters playing run a ball innings barring Mayank lol,6
"Come on 3D boi, get us a wicket!",4
"If both rusell n morgan misfire today

We are fucked today",6
Shankar annaaaaa,12
Pritam garg everywhere,6
Rana being rana. Take risks just after the wicket.,6
"Holy shit garg shining today, and 3d got a wicket lmfao",7
Rana giving a throwback to Samson from yesterday,7
Garg is an outstanding fielder man,4
shankar subbing for rashid..,5
r/cricket meming Vijay Shankar back into form.,7
"Yess baby, nice running catchm it gone mile in the air. 2 catches in row",4
Priyam has been phenomenal on fieldüî•,3
Next Game. KKR PR - We have received a request from Shubman Gill to be dropped from the team as he wants to concentrate on his test batting. Shastri has been impressed by his batting in IPL and wants to take him to Australia as the third opener. He also will have a training camp with Sachin tendulkar.,6
Lol they just can't score against Shankar.,2
Garg the one man fielder,5
"FFS, our management sucks donkey balls. Why is Russell coming ahead of Morgan?",2
"I reckon the reasoning behind Russell now is that they know he won‚Äôt just eat up balls.

He‚Äôll either plank it into the stands over and over or do it once then get caught.",4
"Your middle order is Russell, DK and Morgan, which is pretty decent. The openers should score at a higher rate than they currently are.",5
Ahhhh come on man Rana was doing well for once,1
3D was doped.,3
Garg is so good to watch on the field,7
Daft shot by Rana. Wicket just fall. Russell is there to do power hitting. Just support him. I wonder why can't some players apply some brain while batting..,2
"Before the start of the tournament, 3D said he will take his bowling to the next level this year. Looks like he is delivering on his words.",3
Vijay Shankar for Indian side!,3
Rana is playing as Per his usual. Shoe promise and then get out,4
"Lefty gon

Lefty com?",2
3D bowling,2
Rana in place of Pant surely lads or next innings?,2
3D has been our best bowler today,5
"I bet KKR have the list no of 50's. 

Their batsmen all get out in 30s.",1
Garg is our new specialist fielder.,5
Wow Shankar is actually 3D,5
Ichadayyo Swami,3
Garg doing OT to make up for the team,2
Garg taking two fab catches. Amazing,1
"Lmao what the fuck does Baz write all the time? Whatever he must be writing must be garbage for sure, his management has been a fucking mess.",0
Vijay Shankar's guardian angel working overtime today.,3
"Fuck bangar

Has it goes the distance? 

Ball falls inside 30 yard circle",5
Shaw>>Gill in T20s,-3
Why do I watch this fucking team anymore,0
"Another wicket goes down for KKR

Baz: *Makes notes vigorously*",6
Rayudu might be crying.,5
"3 overs 15 runs and a wicket I better not see ppl mending Shankar, he deserves the wicket

Hopefully he carries the confidence into batting",3
Russel and Morgan batting together could be bad for us tho,3
"**12.1** Shankar to Rana, OUT, **taken at midwicket.** It's Garg again, and he had a long long way to run to take this. **88-3**

N Rana c Garg b Shankar 29 (20b 3x4 1x6) SR: 145.00",2
Rana is the most inconsistent batman I have seen,4
Can't blame Rana. The intent was there. You can't simply let the 5th bowler get away for cheap.,11
Use RTM on Garg in auction. Get him in the squad no matter what.,11
Mccullum scribbling: Tell the team to hit the ball far away from Priyam Garg,10
I blame Shubman.......,6
"Dre Russ was MVP of ipl 2019. Looking at the terrible season he's had so far, this is a stark reversal of fortune.",9
Seriously speaking I don't like Gill opening we already have plethora of openers don't know why I feel like he should be next Kohli & become a middle order mainstay.,4
Once more Gill trying to be the hit-out-er and getting out. He should be a sheet anchor for their innings and that's it. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,3
"With Baz writing so much, you'd think KKR wouldn't shit the bed like this",9
Kanos injured again! Man is made up of glass..,12
"Now what, Russel blocks Shankar...

What did you conjure today 3D?",5
Pray for my man Nattu. Russell gonna pick his bowling. It's net practice,7
"This is the problem with kkr

Gill gets out n Wicket starts to fall like dominos",7
Medium pace length balls against Russell is like chucking pies,2
Shaw>Gill,3
"Rana or SKY?

Choose one.",1
All hopes lie on russell,2
3d might actually be our main bowler now lmao,9
"VShanks bowling a length ball at 110k.

Dre with a beautiful back foot defense.

Wtf is going on?",5
Shankar has his 3D glasses on today.,6
Garg in team for being a specialist fielder,10
Manish Pandey gonna be angry at Garg's performance considering he has a role as a specialist fielder.,6
KKR don't belive in batting order at all they send players according to situations. No rigidness full flexibility I like that.,7
Oof dk would be better at 4 in today's sitch. Russ better to tonk at the death against this attack especially.,3
Yes Russell needs to get on asap.,3
KKR's final score prediction?,3
"And this is the problem with decent but slow partnerships in t20.

Might look good for the batsman‚Äôs stats but now the middle order need to go at 10s from the off to get to a good target.",7
"Hi American here new to cricket why is Bumrah bowling for SRH, I thought he played for MI",21
"Lmao, Rashid was the sacrifice to get 3D back to form",23
"It's too wide, it begins",5
Young players like Rashid can learn a lot by watching a master like 3D at work.,8
No one to trouble Russell today,2
Finally someone punishes that rubbish bowling,-2
Really good bowling,3
All Gill has done today is prove Shaws value as T20 bat. Will be out for a duck often but if hes facing 36 balls hell be striking at 140 minimum. Gill has put so much pressure on Russel and Morgan and DK to follow,44
What a spell by Shankar!,7
How many dots has shankar bowled,4
3D with Bhuvi-esque numbers!,13
4-0-20-1. Excellent bowling by 3D,15
Shankar's stats today courtesy to Gill,3
4 overs for 20 runs and 1 wicket. This isn't Rashid' stats. #Team3D,10
Right set of a mind set? üòÇüòÇ,2
If these two get going any score is possible,3
Some freak inning by Russell is our last hope now.,5
"Come on dreruss

Without ur form, we got no shots at the title",3
Gill‚Äôs slow innings are causing much troubles to KKR. It‚Äôs generating extra pressure on other players.,8
"Shankar got away with 5rpo 4 overs, big boost for SRH",4
"3D : 4-0-20-1..?
Is this his best?",6
"About as good a spell you can get from the 5th bowler. Yes, he bowled at ""hit me"" pace, but more or less nailed the lines and lengths.",6
Shankar with the kind of figures you would expect from Rashid. Rashid with the figures you would expect from Shankar.,5
3D showing off one dimension of his skills today with that 4-0-20-1.,3
"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'd any day take a shaw over a Paddikal or a Gill. Shaw either hits out or gets out. Doesn't hog the strike and consume couple others along with him.",7
[deleted],3
Rashid v Russel let‚Äôs go,3
Just get rid of these impostors and get our main bat Cummins in,4
Letting Shankar get away with figures of 1/20 is a criminal offence,2
If 3D Shankar is walking away with 4-0-20-1 coaches need to give their batsmen an earful,4
Russel just doesn't know about getting set,6
Russell just give the strike to Morgan for Rashid,3
"Do you think how players like Lara are finding small errors in batting grips that lead to major issues, used to do that when they were captaining their sides? Or is that too hard to judge in a live game? I still remember he was saying that how Stokes is holding his bat, his sweeps towards cow corner against ashwin are going to be a lot squarer than usual and delhi should keep that into account when setting deep mid wicket. In that over ball went in that are 3 times and every time rabada needed to run to his left to stop it.",4
Last over of Rash. Play it cool Dre.,2
Anything above 140 is par when SRH Chases,10
Should have spared another over of Rashid because of these two.,4
Russell will go after Rashid,3
Kolkata Knight Thalas,3
"People were Saying Russel is better than Pollard after one year heroics. 

I think this IPL settles that Debate. 

Pollard has been doing it for 10 years for MI.",3
"I know it's not an RCB ~~or KXIP~~ game now, but can any of my Kannadigabros help tell me what the Kannada lyrics in this year's RCB anthem mean?",3
"Gill just poisons the feel of watching a KKR match. All this praise and TLC from the first family of cricket has gone to his head.They put him in the LEADERSHIP GROUP of KKR apparently before the season.  
Why? for what? for me he's not an automatic pick in the XI  
His running between the wickets sickens me with its laziness and he cant play big shots to compensate it.  
What a fraud",7
Rashid must have World Cup PTSD bowling to Morgan.,5
"Garg, underrated",3
Is dk playing Today?,1
Has williamson been injured ?,5
"Judging by this IPL, Dhawan and Rohit needn't worry about losing their white ball opening spots anytime soon.",10
"Eoin Morgan v Rashid Khan 

What could possibly go wrong?",7
"Slow. Batting. Doesn't. Work. In. T20s.

Why it's so hard for players to get? KL, Kohli, Gill have been culprits in some matches.",2
I‚Äôm sorry. Russell is a great hitter but I don‚Äôt think Russell is a good enough shot selector to last 8 overs,4
The fuck is Russell trying to do,2
Slash is umpiring i hope axl rose does not come out to bat now.,6
Who is this commentator? The one talking about picking Rashids length. Very good analysis,6
Who is the hippie umpire?,2
4 overs of Rashid done on the positive side,2
Gill is probably KKRs biggest problem. These innings are ridiculous. How can you face almost a third of the total balls in the innings and score at under a run a ball? He needs to score faster somehow or stop opening,7
Abu Dhabi has to be one of the most scenic stadiums in the world only second to Newlands,2
The fact that an economy of 7 is bad by Rashid standards tells you a lot,3
Shankar be like: Who's the fifth bowler now!,5
Harsha Bhogle: Love seeing young players who are excellent in the field because it tells me a thing or two about their attitude. Priyam Garg is eye-catching in the field.,1
Rashid still ended with decent 1/28.,6
"Like what is Gill doing lmao 

You are playing at 100 SR fine may be you are playing as anchor 

But then dude gets out at the end of 10 overs lmao",5
We have 2nd worst death bowling economy in the tournament. Hopefully we'll do better today.,3
"Russell has to give respect to the bowlers, doesnt do that and gets out early. Just play rashid out",2
Russell can't hit because the Umpire is distracting with that awesome hair.,2
"Kabhi kabhi mere ko toh lagta hai, yeh Baz Bhai satta lagaane ke liye notes likhta hai :p

Team performance me toh koi improvements nahi hai, lekin bhai toh notes likhe ja rha hai.",5
"Slash,waddaya doing umpiring in an IPL match?",2
3 Indian medium pacers against Morgan and Russell can't be good. I am scared AF for sandeep's 2 overs.,5
"If Dawid Malan came out for England and scored 36 off 37, Morgan would drop him for the next 6 months...Gills probably lucky Morgs has only just taken the captaincy and doesn‚Äôt have the full influence yet.",9
"Actually i feel kkr shud bat Morgan at 3

He is more than capable n got runs under his belt",6
"Nice comeback over from Rash, still expensive tho given his record",4
"Shankar's figures are better than rashid's 
*2020*",7
Everyone is discussing about KKR's batting order.,2
Proper choke job,1
Lmao you know how highly rated Rashid is for us when 1-28 is a bad day for him,7
Remember when Narine and lynn opened and in one pp they hit over 100..... I miss those days,7
"Cummins and Morgan should be their only batsman. All other 9 player should be bowlers. 

I keep defending Gill , but you can't 37 ball to settle and get out. This is just a shitting batting.",7
"This is the chance for KKR.  

Russell & Morgan vs. Thampi, Sandeep, and Natarajan.",5
I daresay narine opening with tripathi would be better than this...,6
Morgan to Karthik: Look at me üëÄ I am the captain now üî´üö¢,7
Wow! We are sooo fucking useless,9
Russel will Roast Sandeep Sharma pace all over the park. We need to get him early,1
"Holy shit I didn't realise 14 overs have gone by, we bowled well",5
"Fuck, it's a noball",4
There is no perfect batting order everything should be according to match situation,8
Nattu please don't bowl yorkers if you are missing them. Russell will eat you alive.,1
Bc such a big no ball. WTF is he thinking,7
r/justneckbeardthings.,3
Seems like a bad captaincy decision by Warner to bowl 2 Sandeep overs in the death vs a potential Russell especially considering how good he was in the powerplay last game,3
Are umpires no longer watching for crease no balls?,2
"Gill's really been underwhelming this year tbh

KKR haven't batted well but it doesn't help having an opener score 30+ at a strike rate of 100 regularly, puts pressure on the rest to up the ante very quickly",10
Jesus fucking Christ man,5
Should have given Samad an over before using Rashid.,3
"Not that this batting order needs anymore confusion, but maybe Rana and Gill need to switch places. Rana is aggressive which is good for an opener, Gill could take his time after a wicket falls. 

I don't know man. This entire batting order is made of stars who have just found ways to shit the bed. Complete waste of potential.",3
Shit bowling tbh,2
"I don't want KKR to win but I think this is a great platform for Russell and Morgan to go berserk. 

They should gun for 75/80 runs off the last 6 overs and kill the game here.",3
"Mayank Agarwal and Surya Yadav deserve the hype the likes of Samson, Gill, Shaw etc have been getting.",10
We are trying so hard to bring russell in to form.,4
KKR can give us our Munda Gill back next year. Gill playing as anchor and giving stability while Kl mayank Pooran Maxwell Gayle go gun blazing would be amazing,4
I feel like russel is going to hit 20+ runs of both of thampi's overs,5
Morgan almost did a Finchy,1
Warner should've stopped that,1
It's staggering that this KKR side are 4th in the table. Says more about how bad the bottom 4 teams have been.,4
"We are going to bring Morgan and Russell to form, aren‚Äôt we?",3
"I am a simple man... everytime I see a huge no ball, I think spot fixing..",22
The are gonna play sandy in the death aren‚Äôt they wtf,2
If KKR scores 170+ we are done.,3
Wonder if this ground can host a limited number of spectators on the grass. There are plenty of higher risk activities being allowed currently. Outdoor activities with proper social distancing are low risk. Obviously there's a problem with enforcement but I don't think the COVID situation is as bad in UAE as it is in the US or India.,0
"Just quietly, I think I‚Äôm a big fan of the no ball siren",8
Morgan hit Natarajan's ball for four so Natarajan targetted Morgan's balls,8
Gill is super overrated in t20s. He only is getting a pass because he is young and has the hype. Shaw is much better tbh.,12
Kkr is essentially playing a 15 over match as gill ends up playing 30 balls in each match with strike rate of around 100,6
Abey full toss to Russell? He is sparing you. Don't try those,3
Morgan is one of the worst players of spin in the IPL. Russell would salivate are the prospect of facing medium pacers at the death. Why the fuck do you not take a chance at the part-timer spinner before being so desperate to use Rashid‚Äôs last over.,-3
"160 is really good total here. 

Looks slowish pitch n srh chasing",5
Basil Thampi will either win this match for SRH or  worse his record for max runs given. Nothing in between,2
Gill having better SR than Russellüò≠,7
"Nattu needs to take a wicket, I'll have a stroke if I see 3d on top in match summary",3
What is a good total on this current pitch & surface?,1
Is Williamson fine?,1
Thampi is gonna get Thumped here!!,2
Deep Dasgupta is a better commentator than Bhogle,-1
Who is the new dugout commentator?,2
Hoping for a repeat of the yorker that Mustafizur bowled to Andre Russell.,7
[deleted],7
Rip to sandys last 2 overs,6
NATTU MY BOY,3
"Nattu, you beauty!!",3
NATTUUUUU YA BEAUTYYYYY,5
That's a BIG wicket.,5
"Damn, Russell is an imposter.",3
Excellent Field placement,5
F,3
Srh have a great pool of overseas players but shat their bed while picking out Indian players. Bought all u19 players,3
11 balls faced hahahaha,4
The most brainless batsman I have seen in recent years after Samson.,17
Russell is genuinely all muscle and no brains.,9
My boi 3d,7
HOLY FUCK,3
"So, Russell is the impostor in KKR..",9
Let‚Äôs gooooo,2
Lmao anti climax,3
"Straight to the fielders , yes bc. Perfect set-up",4
Fraud Russell out.,8
Dre Russ is gone! Field placement on point.,3
Joke of a team this year,1
TUK TUK RUSSEL! 9(11),3
If he gets the timing right.....Oh no,2
Press F for KKR,2
Wow... Straight to the fielder.... Sandeep Sharma can breath a sigh of relief,5
NUTTIN 4 NATTU,4
Very nice Nattu!,9
Russell must back himself up in bowling. This is a disaster. Just the usual for KKR,8
Definitely not Dre's year,6
3D again,1
Russell muscle goes pssssssss,4
holy fuck he hit it right at the fielder,3
From MVP to this,1
Good to see Russell not on the strike now for sandy,5
**Three-dimensional fielding**,5
"Fuck you too, Russell. Been atrocious with the bat.",5
"*INVESTIGATION IDEA*

""Is Andre Russell Brain-dead?""",0
"Lmao, Vijay Shankar was camping in the cow corner for Dre Russ",6
"Russell is fucking disaster this season, jeez",3
This game is a Shankar masterclass.,3
Perfectly Jebaited. Had a fielder waiting exactly at cow corner.,5
"**14.6** Natarajan to Russell, OUT, **he's found deep midwicket!** **105-4**

AD Russell c Shankar b Natarajan 9 (11b 1x4 0x6) SR: 81.81",3
"Shankar showing his real 3D look this match lmao, all I need now is a Shankar century xD",5
wow nattu wow,2
Great bowling. Fielder didn't even need to move.,4
"Remember when I said they‚Äôve sent Russell out because they know he won‚Äôt just eat up deliveries...

There‚Äôs a reason I never made it as a cricket analyst..",15
KKR is fooked,2
Might be useful bringing in Seifert or Banton instead of Russell.,3
"Russell - What do you want from me , I am bowler now.",8
Thats the 2nd dimension for the day :/,4
"If our 5 bowlers perform today, KKR should really look to replace Russell with Banton. His batting is just not working.",6
Thankfully Russell is so out of form. We might have a chance,8
Noooo,5
I never heard of a 3D fan. Who is the commentator again?,8
Today's Discussion Point KKR batting order again,2
DreRuss is a one season wonder?,3
[removed],8
"Fuck bangar

Every time he praises a shot batsman gets caught",-1
"Dre Russ biggest fraud of IPL 2020. ""gIvE mE 15 oVeRs tO bAt"" sure.",15
Russell's poor batting form continues,4
Russell has been worse than maxwell with the bat and thats saying something,9
"3D has already showed his 2 dimensions today, waiting to unleash the 3rd one.",9
chad shankar really stayed 2 inches infront of the boundary for virgin russell,9
"If srh bowling attack can‚Äôt bring Russell to form, he is a lost cause",8
KKR forgot the special injection at Eden Gardens,7
Russell has done a Thala,6
How much is par score here against Srh batting ?,3
"I maybe misremembering but wasn't Kallis like a pretty decent coach for KKR. They made the playoffs almost every year in his stint. 

I remember he was really good for the franchise as a player. 

Baz comes with a big reputation but some of his decision making is very strange.",16
Time to give Banton a run,11
Looks like Gill played the same Tuk Tuk as Padikkal yesterday,13
Looks like Dre Russ was trying to implement Thala Dhoni‚Äôs tips.,7
I'll be really pissed if Russel fires against us on Wednesday.,8
I had gone for 15 mins and kkr lost 3 wickets.  Y am i even expecting anything from them at this point,2
Where my US SRH fans at?? We are seeing an early morning 3D miracle,14
Need Nidhas DK.,6
UAE wicket not suited to him,4
Russell has got way too many chances to prove same improve his form. How long can KKR afford him?,7
Russell didn't get his Compound V,12
Russell & Cummins have switched thier roles,17
Please kick Russell,3
"Sixer Shami > 2020 Russell 

Other teams are just lucky that KL and Mayank are protecting them from the wrath of Sixer Shami.",15
Russel and his 10 balls curse this season,10
Warner looks like he wants to start dancing again to his tik tok collection.,7
"As a KKR fan, I'm just pretending the entire 2020 doesn't exist",6
How to change flair guys,1
Kkr is like my dre russ is broken. Pls replace it.,2
I'm sorry but I just can't deal with this long haired umpire. Every time I see him signal a four or six I start laughing üòÇ,9
"Time to shitpost.........No retention at all. This whole team is garbage. Start the Auction by picking two proper Indian batsmen, one proper Indian pacer and one proper Indian pacer. Use RTM if need be but don't retain none of them. Also change the management.",12
"DK gonna boost them to 160, he's still MY captain",6
Russell muscle to Russell hustle,1
Need 2018 dk,1
Should Just use Cummins in place of Russell,3
Looks like Vijay Shankar saw that Rayudu innings yesterday,8
Russell probably only succeeded in India due to the smaller grounds,5
What is the cow's corner? Is that not mid wicket?,3
I am sure Russell has not hit 20 this year.,6
Russell yet to face more than 14 balls this season. Why tf is he not dropped?,9
If anyone can bring Russell into form it's rcb,10
What was the issue between Karthik and russel last year?,3
Come on guys lets bully dk and morgan to make then score big,2
Dreruss has been a shit show this year tbh.,9
"                    Russel  ü§ù Maxwell

Biggest disappointments of the tournament!",57
What‚Äôs with the DJ playing telugu songs in an empty stadium üòÖüòÖ,4
Is this last IPL for Russell? He is always injury prone and on top of that he hasn't scored runs at all.,1
"Pat the bully is yet to come , don't forget.",2
Are Hotstar's IPL numbers much lower than last year? I remember 5-6M used to be the norm but matches rarely break 4.5M now,6
[deleted],9
Replace gill with lad atleast he doesn't eat up balls,1
"Kane is off the field. Well, we are fucked with our batting now.",5
"Pandey could‚Äôve caught that, right?",2
See's batting crumbling every game                                                  Baz probably - years of writing in the book wasted,5
Last 33 balls 31 runs and 3 wickets,4
In before Cummins 50* (18).,12
Punjab pls win today.,7
Warner looks absolutely delighted with life.,8
"Now again i cant blame Gill fully

With middle order misfiring again",9
hope dk can bat well now,6
What‚Äôs gotten into Gill? Why these run-a-ball innings?,4
"If I have a grievance against this IPL so far, it‚Äôs the lack of stump mic volume.

What‚Äôs the point in Bairstow being behind the sticks if we can‚Äôt hear him shit talking his own national team captain before every ball..",23
At this point replace Russel with Ferguson.,1
"It's amazing how Russel can have 9 games without doing anything and no commentator/expert questions his place while someone like Maxwell who's hardly had got to bat for a decent while because of KL ""SR IS OVERRATED"" Rahul was being called to be dropped after 4-5 games.

I don't think either should be dropped rn because their teams doesn't have anyone who can do what they can in their teams.",11
Every match kkr plays makes it more clear that russell will score a double ton v rcb,12
Any update on Williamson?,4
Watching kkr is so painful these days,8
"As far as their batting is concerned, Kkr should get banton in for Russell, open with tripathi and banton with gill batting in the middle",1
Captain and Ex Captain batting together here,8
Get Cummo in already.,4
Dugout rly thinks KKR are gonna drop Russell lol. He falls in the league of the undropables,8
Finally looks like Bmac completed his assignment.,8
Who's that umpire?,4
Why wasn't Narine played today when his action was cleared?,3
Hahahahah lmao Swanne,5
Was Mccullum a coach of Trinbago too?,2
Swanny mumbai Indians will win against England.,4
Where is my Cummins,1
Lmao swann taking a dig at World XI aka England national team,8
Russell would hope Ferguson doens't perform this game or he may take the axe for getting Narine in,4
"Just tuned in and I thought it was a historical match with 1 female umpire

Im disappointed",14
Lmao dugout having a dig at england cricket team,8
Michael Jackson is ready for timeout after dancing so much.,10
KKR thinking they're playing against prime SRH bowling.. ;_;],9
"So you are telling me sandy gets most of his wickets from his slow balls...of his already slow bowling, lol",7
Why did DK step down from captaincy? DK move,3
"Just drop Russel for 1 game , get in Narine to smash",3
This game conclusively proves that Vijay Shankar is a better bowler than Rashid Khan.,3
[deleted],7
Perfect setup for DK to score 30 odd.,3
"Between Warner's pornstache and that umpire's luscious locks, this game is desperately in need of bald frauds.",15
KKR could have won at least 2 more games if they switched the batting order around,1
Swann is so fun to listen on comm box.,5
Come on DK!! Show your worth!,1
"Ok, which result is better for RCB?",5
Get to 160 at least?,3
On his book McCullum just writes the number of times he‚Äôs to hit each of these numbskulls to get across his point.,11
"Kkr is the perfect representation of Kolkata...laid back, relaxed, lazy and just doesn't have a fuck to give.",28
Who's that umpire with the dodgy hair?,2
I wonder why SRH didn't take barinder sran as the replacement for bhuvi. He played pretty decent for us in the past,6
That moment when you realise there are two over of Thampi left in the last 4 overs.,8
Nice to finally see female umpires in the ipl,4
KKR will be happy with 150-160 from here,3
"Ok, which result is better for MI?",-2
"Bigger grounds and non-flat pitches not suiting a slogger, colour me surprised.",7
I really hope the broadcasters don't mess with Swann's commentary.. he's really gotten into his element in here. In the zone right now. He's able to do serious analysis and mix in the Danny Morisson level clowing too at the same time now. Initially he seemed a bit lost and confused but not anymore.,33
Thampi has been given two overs at the death for us. Why did I prefer we give Samad an over in the middle? So we wouldn‚Äôt get pounded with Thampi who has a shit record at the death.,2
"Jason Holder isn't able to bat for Williamson, if he can't go, can he?",3
Time for Basil Beamers,4
Advantage of playing with SRH is it shows the flaws of Batting strength and glorifies the Bowling strength.,10
Will be a miracle if we reach even 150 from here.,4
What a brilliant RR,3
How the fuck is Cummins among the MVPs of this IPL? He's been one of the worst bowlers!,7
Thampi! that's the dude that Pant demolished last year yeah?,9
160 should be a defendable score against SRH. Their middle order is probably even shittier than KKR even with Kane in the middle,6
McCullum is writing down the names of players he would buy for next auction.,53
Swamny Jnr. is going to ensure he gets carted off to a retirement home soon.,8
Which result is better for Delhi,-1
Nice save by YJB,9
Clean shaven Bairstow looks sus,7
Just objectively poor batting as a team so far. Not gonna win the IPL like this,6
The Flying OrangeMan,7
OMG Bairstow is looking weird without a beard!,5
"If u dont hit thampi

Who r u planning to

Nattu??",-2
Lmao their strategy is to hit rashid and natarajan and defend thampi and 3D or what?,9
Is Kane back? Saw him go off and chillin with the physio before,2
I hope Dhawan keeps his current form going. These young openers aren't cutting it,8
Shame on any batting line up that gets to 112 in 16 against this line up with 28 from Rashid,10
So it begins,4
Uh oh. YJB has shaved his beard off. 0(2) incoming,8
Thampi went for 70 runs something last year at Chinnaswamy.,9
"is the horn the only sound effect they have?

makes this almost unwatchable",2
Lmao...Barstool somehow looks more ginger after he shaved his beard off.,4
Captain Morgan is a whiskey brand isn't it?,8
This 2015 England World Cup team.,5
Abt 20 runs with edges for us already,3
Thampi is obviously better than Siraj right?,12
"2020 ipl team of the season?

Du Plessis

Some good yorkers from Thampi.,5
"Thampi looks frustrated with life.The dropped catch,the edges boundaries....",6
"Clean shaved Bairstow isn't real he can't hurt you

Clean shaved Bairstow:",15
What speed is Thampi bowling at?,4
"Name your band spirit of cricket swanny. 

Because it's gonna get broken eventually.",3
Is there anything more iconic than Morgan's scowl when he tries to hit the big shot?,7
DK showing Morgan the way,2
"Both CSK and KKR have been disadvantaged a lot by IPL in UAE. KKR‚Äôs pacers would‚Äôve liked the fresh pitches at Eden and their batsmen would‚Äôve preferred it as well. 

Basically in this IPL we are getting a show of which IPL team is objectively better rather than a better build team which will get results taking into external factors.",17
KKR might as well open with Cummins the next game and use Gill's place to play both Mavi and Krishna.,2
"Imagine if Morgan and Karthik wreck SRH in the next 3, in an attempt to one up each other. Haha jk... unless",4
" 

**Umpires:**

Sundaram Ravi, Pashchim Pathak - the 2nd one is the guy with curly hair, i too thought he was a she at first",6
I still remember Thampi with 12 yorkers on the trot a couple of seasons ago against MI if im not wrong,2
Clean shaven Bairstow looks like a dumpy Ron Weasley,5
These mid-level Indian batsmen are soooooo comfortable when the ball is around 130-135 KPH and bounce around waist level...,2
Has Unadkat ever played international game for India?,5
Morgan needs to earn his price in this over. Minimum 2 sixes.,1
Big over alert!,1
Dafuq happend to Russell? Not a single good inning,2
Love me some Kylie Minogue,2
I think Khaleel was better than Thampi,5
This over can be big.,0
"Thampi isn't cut for us, at least khaleel took wickets while having the same economy",8
They dropped kuldeep who's a national team player but they can't drop Russell when he's been awful this whole season.,12
Couldn't even clear 30 yard circle,2

KKR players are trying to piss Brendon with their low strike rate that Brendon himself decides to play.,7
hit some sixes captain,5
/r/reversejinx isn't claimed yet. Are you listening srh fans?,5
whoa. is this stadium literally in the middle of a desert?,11
Morgan isn't being the Morgan we knew right?,1
"Sooo, where's Cooldeep these days?",3
Great bowling performance by SRH,2
Woah. JP is one good looking dude with that hair.,4
Sandeep actually bowling well in the desth too,2
Just tuned in. Is that a lady umpire?,2
I think that long haired umpire was distracting KKR batsmen,3
How the fuck is this KKR team still fav to qualify for 4th spot?,11
Are we bowling well for once or is the wicket difficult to bat ?,2
Swann with the pirate banter lol,0

Karthik farming strike.,3
Who is this zulfekar,2
They are straight up trolling Nehra now lol,3
DK plays better sweeps against pacers than spinners,1
Captai.....I mean dinesh kartik lesssgoo,1
Baz is writing something every time the camera pans towards him. He's like me whenever the invigilator comes around during exams,9
"DK might even get a second apology thread this season..If people are desperate enough for karma, that is.",3
"It matters he found the gap Harsha, else he could have been caught",5
DK has seemed better than VK this year. At least it looks like that with the bowling,4
"Lol wtf is dk dk chant

Pretty sure they missed boss somewhere",12
Baz should just open from next match. What do you have to lose?,6
What‚Äôs are the odds of the umpire being a part of a band? Pretty sure he plays mad drums,3
I miss 2018 SRH bowling that defended 118 against MI,28
Would like to have KKR at the last spot in the points table after the IPL,-1
Off topic but how can someone score 4 fucking hundreds in one IPL tournament,4
I am not sure if all the thirsty mofos on r/cricket can handle it if the suits actually appoint a female umpire.,10
Bruh thampi in the final over. Good luck,10
What the fuck is that DJ,3
This DJ is atleast 50 years old based on his song choices.,8
What song was on?,2
They're playing daddy cool song. Wtf is wrong with them,6
Blasphemy. You play Daddy Cool when you have a rockstar out in the middle!,6
"Mad respect to the DJ for playing Daddy Cool, that's my dad's favourite English song",13
DK doing well is always a feel good feeling.,11
"I can play freely without pressure of being a captain

He was right",9
DK showing Morgan how its done,3
"As Mega auction is not happening, most teams will have same players in next IPL , how much difference will it make for teams to play in Indian grounds again ... especially CSK in Chennai, RCB in Chinnaswamy.",6
"If DK played the same way Morgan did, this sub would've called for him to be dropped. Double standards.",10
A gentle reminder that DK‚Äôs ridiculous over in Nidahas as 100+ Million views in YT,7
"Dk is the og captain

Morgan is sus here",6
No coincidence that the camera pans to Cummins when DaddyCool is playing in the background,8
Kohli's hunger for left arm pacer can be fulfilled by natarajan now and not khaleel.,5
Shoulda played this song in CSK games,2
Who's that umpire.,1
"Karthik- best Indian finisher right now (T20)?

Who comes close? Pant, Hardik maybe.",9

WinViz- 69% in favour of KKR,7
"Hold up, 3D went for just 20? Wtf",8
Sorry Natu the neck beard doesn‚Äôt work,11
Haha that bit about AB DeVilliers,3
DK proved his worth more than Morgan in the IPL.,9
Last year all we used to say in the form Russell was in that give him more balls to play. This season idk what's up with him .....,6
"What a borefest, IPL should be just RCB vs KXIP.",7
Morgan js just another Gill,0
Great SR morgan but you are not dhoni so we will not troll because we dont  have hateboner for you,5
"Another captain with the anchor knock, doesn't matter the phase, u need a an anchor",8
Captaincy pressure got to Morgan,7
That was terrible. After close to 20 balls at the crease that should have been deposited over midwicket.,3
Morgan can't hit shit rn,5
Captain's curse in the KKR Camp,6
Garbage performance from KKR,2
Chad dk aiming for the altroz,10
DK is back boys,6

So DK > Morgan now or we gotta wait??,8
DK showing Captain Morgan how to be a finisher,11

Nehra ji: Nahi lekin length ball daalke wicket prapt karte hain yeh.",18
DK showing how it's done.,7
He was aiming for the altroz,3
DK was not the impostor,8
So who's the weird Al umpire?,4
Do these players get anything for Hitting the Altroz?,4
Commentators petitioning to remove DK from IPL for harming national crush Altroz,8
Karthik has been the only KKR batsman who has looked comfortable,2
Chad DK shows his dig bick to virgin Morgan.,4
Is this just shit bowling or is DK playing really well?,2
Swann's selling makes Shawn Michaels look like a noob.,1
We need that Morgan who hit 17 sixes back. His performances this IPL have been extremely poor,4
Dugout is all of us sitting at home wondering if its six or catch.,2
shouldve hit the fuckign altroz,8
"Damn, it's almost DK as a finisher does well!",2
"DK is a very underrated Player.. If not for MS, he would have been a regular in Indian squad",0
"Sometimes fan outrage does not make sense. Karthik, Shaw have not been bad this season.",1
"This is the Karthik who I was missing. Free from any burden of captaincy and playing at no. 4 nonsense.

Karthik has always been anexcellent finisher and that's all he should have been asked to do from the start.",12
Chad DK,3
"Commentators: this is surely gonna be out

*ball clears boundary by a distance*",3
"This clearly shows that Mcculum's strategy sending DK at 3 or 4 was completely wrong. This is what he does best and should have just used him as a finisher from the start.

And, DK got all the abuse for coming ahead of Morgan at that time",8
Morgan farming strike,2
Thanks for the second,2
Why didn't dk keep strike lol.,4
maybe karthik likes playing in the afternoon in abu dhabi,4
Why tf is DK running 2 there,3
Bruh Morgan isn't even hitting full tosses,3
Why do they have different helmet shapes ? Like tripati,3
Thala Morgan casually copying Thala Dhoni with smoking that full toss beyond the 30 yard circle.,3
"If Willamson can't be at 100 percent maybe let him open in the powerplay, give him some easier shots to play.",2
The score is more than enough to defend against SRH,5
Morgan's customary sixes on leg sides coming,2
Nattu pls neck beard plssss remove it,6
Morgan can't judge the pace even when it's full toss.,1
Thala Morgan,5
Morgan seeing it like a golf ball at the moment,2
This is actually pretty good bowling from srh. Most balls are in blockhole,1
"DK to Morgan: ""*Why Are You Chirping Now Mate? Not getting any runs?*""",14
Grame Swann is savage,8
"Looking at how DK is playing after relieving himself of captaincy, maybe Morgan should step down from Captaincy. Lol make Russell the Captain.",7
A boundary for the better,2
That‚Äôs 4,2
4 bruh,1
Looks 4 to me,1
"Just turned on the game, this umpire has the locks of a god!",7
What weed is Swanny on today,2
Swann lmaooo,2
No let DK have the last 4 balls!,1
thats a boundary,3
Did swanny just do an apu?,2
"Swann: You watch the hand and ill watch cred

xDD",3
Why aren't they sending in their top scorer Cummins to bat?,3
Morgan tewatia,0
Rocka rolla üï∫üï∫,3
Swann is more in form than our batsmen,4
Looked 4 to me,2
SRH should go the Mumbai way and chase this down.,7
Morgan deserves dropping tbh,4
That is a boundary. Let's move on!,9
"It will be a surprise if DK doesnt make the T20WC, even as the backup keeper. 
He's a better hitter than Dhoni, Pant, Iyer, or Pandey.",13
"Why are people desperate to make some DK vs Morgan narrative, they seem to respect each other and get on fine",9
How is that a tough call to make. Wtf Harsha? Clear 4,5
"They take 20 years to decide between 3 runs vs 4 runs, but then rely on teams to review bad lbw decisions. Wtf?",7
Give dk the strike pleaseee.,1
Paschimi Sabhyata,3
Woah slow down Morgan.,1
"If the roles were reversed and Morgan played like DK, the commentary team would have orgasmed.",2
[deleted],0
"It's clearly 4, how is this taking so long",8
Both captains saving the innings,3
DK should have been on the strike.,1
Lmao. Is the Umpire giving Death threat or a four signal?,9
Morgan isn‚Äôt middling anything,-5
Bowl wide and full .. They literally did a segment on Morgan,3
Why haven't i seen this umpire before. Surely it's not a look you forget,6
I think we need angle of the usa drone hovering above middle east for a clear angle.,7
Sexy six,7
Karthik is an excellent finisher. India should have him in T20I side at least.,8
Swann is gold,3
HOLY SHIT MORGAN,6
Thats an enormous hit,6
"Welp, atleast thampi will get a 50",3
Morgan already have hit 14 sixes,3
"Thala Morgan to r/cricket

""Now talk,bitch""",13
"I‚Äôd rather have Khaleel than Thampi, at least he got wickets",7
That's just about the worst ball I've seen bowled at the death.,6
Finally,2
is this a poor score?,3
Bro this last over antics are going to cost us dearly,7
It's very difficult to accept that the same team has bowled the first 16 overs and the last 4,4
Who is that long haired umpire?,5
Basil (T)Humpied,3
Finally. Should have been doing that to Sandeep.,1
Those name puns are bad,3
And people here want Thampi over Khaleel. Atleast Khaleel takes wickets.,15
If Morgan was as selfless as dk he'd hand over the captaincy back to Dinesh kartik,10
Basil Thampi should never get to play another IPL match again,5
Which asshole had the idea of dropping khaleel and bringing thampi?,10
What do you expect bowling thampi at the end?,12
So a 79m hit went outside the ground.,7
Why did they drop Lord Kahleel for Lord Thampi?,4
Man I feel sad seeing Warner's face :(,6
[deleted],6
Basil 50 incoming.,8
"Ok Bois I know what happened. So just before the match started, the local DJ went to the umpire and said, ye main Kar leta hoon, aap dream 11 pe team banaiye",32
Challenge Dhoni to try threaten this umpire. XD,20
Lord Thampi is bacc with a ban,2
"EOIN in a million. 

The people who set these phrases on the on-field scoreboard legit do come up with catchy stuff.",46
Morgan's batlift is intimidating tbh,9
"I feel for thampi. He is not great but he always come in rare games and bowls the hard overs and gets spanked. Gets dropped, rinse and repeat.",10
Team humiliated off a WC. Goes on to win a WC at home. Starts taking it deep‚Ñ¢. We've seen it all! üôå,13
"Two more thundercunts like that, please",3
We look so shit without Bhuvi.,10
"Thampi should be dropped for next match, Khaleel atleast takes wickets even though he gives away runs",5
How is the 'slot' region defined ? One man's slot can be other man's nightmare.,5
Thampi is expensive as shit AND can't take wickets. Choose him over khaleel who atleast gets wickets lmao,7
Why is thampi bowling around the wicket to Morgan? Makes it easier for him to get hit on the leg side,7
"This is like a replay of KKRs last game. Morgan goes at a run a ball giving the strike to the boundary hitter at the other end, and then he smacks the last over himself",5
These last 4 or so are gonna cost us,3
Will Thampi gets a 50 today?,1
DK was a better option as captain than Morgan.,-5
Half century for thampi incoming,1
"Dk gave away wicket keeping in national team, gave up his wife, gave up captaincy and is again giving strike

Be selfless like dk",51
"Come on, Morgan. Thampi deserves that half century. Go for it",2
Every game is the same now. We bowl really well up to 15 overs and then 1-2 overs take the score over par score.,12
 Basil Thampi  is a great sounding name,5
[deleted],12
I think KKR needs to send Patty ahead of Dre Russ next game. It's clear that Patty is in a much better form with the bat.,13
Captain Morgan is a brand of rum,3
"Run morgie, run.",3
What a catch.,2
Catch boi!,2
Karthik still running üòÇ,11
DK has no idea its out and was coming back for 2,12
Great stat padding innings from Morgan,6
DK is the finisher that Indian T20I team needs.,9
"With the exception of the last few overs, the bowlers did really well for the most avg looking bowling attack in the world",11
Kartik is a wholesome naagin killer,11
Bairstow went from Ron Weasley to Dudley Dursley,8
Why is morgan so pale?,5
Lmao Thampi got a wicket. Shit takes wickets tradition continues,1
We are not chasing 164. No way we are the worst chasing side in history of IPL.,8
Is this par score?,4
ON Murugan playing a classic Thala inning with all this last-over scoring.,5
That is a simple catch. Why is Harsha overplaying everything?,-1
"Thampi leaking runs, color me shocked. Questionable choice over Khaleesi ugh",0
Nooo Thampi's 50,1
Cummins is like bitches i need to bat to gain dream11 points.,6
"So ""Murugan"" and ""Karthik"" have achieved a respectable total for... ~~KKR~~ PPR. Pazhani Peacock Riders.",6
Seeing dk happy makes me happy,7
"**19.6** Basil Thampi to Morgan, OUT, **taken at long-off.** Good length ball outside off, hammed flat on the up and straight into Pandey's lap as he runs in from the boundary **163-5**

EJG Morgan c Pandey b Basil Thampi 34 (23b 3x4 1x6) SR: 147.82",1
Calling a 10-30 run win for KKR here,7
Morgan saying average is overrated,3
Hi guys just tuned in. Wholesale changes for KKR. Did they just do it to show that things have changed with the change in captaincy?,1
Thampi with 46 is KKRs highest run scorer,5
"If Thampi plays another match, SRH doesn‚Äôt deserve a place in IPL",2
Varun's gonna wreck srh batting order,3
"I don't understand why folks here keep trying to make this into a DK Vs Morgan animosity kinda thing.

Unless people are privy to some outside info, all they said was DK wanted to focus on his batting and gave up the captaincy willingly and it was his call. Isn't that a good thing?

Maybe it wasn't good for his mental space and he feels better now that the additional burden of keeping + batting + captaincy is gone.",13
Karthik running as if Murali Vijay was in the vicinity.,12
"The srh batting is more than capable of running this down, they just need to approach the game at the right pace",3
Bhuvi injury cost us.,9
Karthik looks like a genuinely nice guy. Never seen him blow his gasket at anyone.,10
What's with all the non-English comments in this thread? Its a violation of Rule 5. Why are they not removed?,-3
The two best batsmen of the team played 30 balls together. Meanwhile Shubman played 37.,6
"If KKR lose the match, this is on Gill. 180+ could have been scored easily. 

No words for Russell",14
"Man that guy DK has 0 ego, he's a perfect team man, captaincy may not be his forte, but surely has enough to get retained by us next year..",26
"For srh, it‚Äôs the batsman‚Äôs game to loose I reckon",4
Morgan should have screamed Nooooooooo. üí¶,6
Tbf this isn't a bad score. If we don't chase this we don't deserve to be in the playoffs.,12
Great reaction by DK despite Morgan throwing away his wicket cheaply,2
Anything above 150+ we are nervous :(,2
3D is back,3
Anything score over 160 is a pretty secure total against SRH. All you have to do is get Warner and Bairstow out relatively early their entire batting lineup will inevitably collapse in on itself most of the time.,4
Don't wanna sound superstitious but last 2 times KKR lost a wicket at the last ball of the first innings they were able to defend that. So SRH losing today as per me.,6
DK didn't get the strike in the last over. Sad. He could have made KKR cross 170 mark.,1
This is brilliant finish by dk and morgan. Maybe next match Russell can bat at 6,8
"We need to idolise our fast bowlers to create a generation of good pace talent in our country. Decades of Sunny Gavaskar, Sachin worship has meant our bowling has been lacklustre. Hopefully young kids start looking upto the Bumrahs and Bhuvis.",11
Gill is really not in good touch. Under 100 SR for an opener is a no go.,4
36 off 37 is just pathetic for an opener,11
This is KKRs to lose now,0
Slow over rate surely?,0
"10 runs short of a par score.  
All eyes on the bowlers now though I think that Lockie (because its his first game) will be targeted and if they can get him away for a few then its smooth sailing for SRH",1
"Jeez, why do y'all keep complaining about Morgan. He played anchor again after a mini collapse as DK was firing and then hit 16 runs in the last over.

DK gave up captaincy and looks relaxed now. Morgan thrives under the responsibility. Do we really need the ""if this was DK"" thing every time?",8
"Career economy on 9.91 and we let him bowl the 20th over. I mean, we really were asking for it.",11
"The problem as always is Manish Pandey. In 180-200 games, he scores 52(39), In 160-180 games he scores 21(18), and in low scoring games, he scores single digit. Consistently scores below the par rate of the surface.",1
They're at least a 20 runs short.,1
Ok. We can't win this.,4
Former captain and current captain with a good partnership.,3
"That was Basil Thampi's first wicket in IPL in 121 balls, five matches and 904 days.

Source: Cricbuzz",9
"Problem with kkr batting has been Gill and Rana, who are in odi mode. Batting with 7 rr till 12th over",1
"If KKR win, it will create a clear difference between the top 4 & bottom 4 and we might have our 4 playoff teams with each team having played only 9 matches yet",8
I love games where 160 is competitive,4
"*Baz writing notes*

""Death overs me DK &  Morgan sath me batting karenge to dono ke beech muqabla chalta rahega aur team ko runs batorne me sahayta ho jayegi""",12
"If gill atleast scored 10 more runs , we would have scored 175.He is wasting so many balls .",7
Shankar seems like a genuinely nice bloke.,4
I hope DK makes the WC squad at least next year. Good option to have as a finisher back up.,2
So Basil Thampi scored more runs than any KKR batsman xD,4
Gill with a decent odi knock,8
Bruh 3D player,3
"**Dinesh Karthik in 19-20 overs in all T20s since 2018**

Runs - 200

Balls - 98

SR - 204.08",17
How is 163 on this pitch & surface? A winning score?,6
Gill tuk tuking Shankar is going to bite us.,1
Will Kane be fit to bat?,1
"So, Sunil Narine is going to be back for the next game and displace Morgan and Karthik again.  

It's all just today, KKR fans.",4
"DK good, Morgan bad.",4
Do we get Ishant Sharma and Bhuvi back before the series down under?,4
Gill was highest run getter for KKR today. Well played Gill!,6
"Ferguson finally getting a game, right place, right match!!",4
Warner MoM innings incoming,3
Gill is one of the gold medalists at the KL Rahul Advanced Institute for Contained Batting with no regards for Strike rate.,14
"DK is an underrated finisher. He has this twitchy restlessness which(when it comes off) makes him think two steps ahead of the bowler and make them look silly.  
Issue is how do we get him/morgan face more of the deliveries while ensuring that the ""FUTURE OF INDIAN CRICKET"" doesnt eat up deliveries at the top",16
No chance in hell we're chasing this down,9
"As a Srh fan, I am ready to get hurt",10
I going to make a hopeful prediction that Manish and 3D will score today,6
Basil Thampi is so shit never been good after getting banged by RCB when playing from Gujrat in 2016,7
Does kkr management have set expectations to Gill to play like this? Or is he in the strike rate is overrated mentality himself.,6
"KKR's slump in form had opened gates to top 4 for other teams. So far, Royals and CSK have failed miserably to take their chances. Hopefully SRH does it today and make the second half somewhat interesting.",6
"I feel like shubman gill is drying out the game way too much for the openers, and never really accelarates.  Im so done with this team to be honest",8
"Kkr need to address slow start and middle overs because of top 3, haven't given middle order a strong start this season",6
Wtf I left at the 15th over great finish,7
"Babar Azam's first copy, S Gill",-10
"Saw Gill's score and thought maybe he was trying to prevent an early collapse but no, the batsmen he batted with, (Tripathi and Rana) played a proper T20 innings",9
[MotoGP + IPL+ Reddit](https://ibb.co/0CHPYrc) <3,4
"Is VJ Shankar more of a McMillan, Klusener, Kemp, Morkel,  Hall, v/d Wath, Wiese, Henderson, Pretorius or a Morris.",3
"Shubman 'KL' Gill, ""strike rate is overrated""",11
"If we don't have the best team, can we at least try to have the best kit? The current jersey looks like someone threw up on a purple rug.",7
"3D: ""If we bowl into the pitch, it'll be difficult to hit.""

Warner: *Chilla chilla ke sab ko scheme bata de*",33
Either Gill or Rana should be dropped,2
Warner will play slower than Gill,2
"Rashid was expensive, but he saved the team a good 10 runs by dropping Gill at 1.",60
I have literally never seen thampi concede less than 40 runs,9
"For ppl shiiting on morgan

He averages 40+ this ipl with 140 sr

N he got out on last ball today

He has just been flying under the radar. He has no big innings to show but has been consistent through out the ipl taking kkr to respectable totals.",9
Vijay Shankar with figures of 4-20(1). Rayudu would be laughing,10
"As an RCB fan, who we supporting in today's matches?",2
"Gill: Takes too many balls doesn't get going 

Russel: Gets going too early

Kane opening????,8
Good to see Kuldeep Jadhav is playing today.,2

Gill needs to be dropped for Pat Cummins as opener,13
Lol Kane opening,8
Woah,3
Kanoos,5
Srh win by 10 wickets,7
Did not expect to see Kanos opening,6

Today My housemate called me from another room and I replied ""‡¶Ü‡¶∏‡¶õ‡ßá """,9
Fuck I thought it was Garg opening but turns out it's YJB.,10
Should have been Warny and Kane,3
I wonder if these coaches ask officials for extra paper like how I used to write long answers in exams just to please the eventual scorers.,2
Woah warner not opening!,5
"Good to see Kanos at the top. If he gets going today, He can play the anchor position better than anyone in the game",8
"When was the last time Warner didn't open? Really surprised by this, wonder what the reasoning is",8
Should‚Äôve been Kanos and Warner opening with Bairstow as a finisher,10
"the team managers really need to read these reddit threads

r/cricket knows best",11
No batting order only match situation,1
"KKR should open with Bmac

Thank me later.",2
Any predictions for pattys bowling today?,2
"Poison cancels poison 



Iron cancels iron 




Williamson will cancel Gill",-11
"One of the most successful openers in IPL,Warner not opening üò≥",10
I think this decision is gonna work out well.,6
Still waiting for 3D bowling to Rayudu this season.,8
Kanos opening has made everything in the world seem good,15
"If vijay Shankar can improve his accuracy, he can be a decent #7 for swinging conditions. He has so much potential but disappoints every time with the bat",9
The plan is probably for Bairstow to go aggressive in the power play and for Kane to abt through the innings,10
Kane opening <3,10
All aboard the **KANE TRAIN** !,13
Warner taking match ups too seriously like Kohli did. Very defensive move to open with Kane imo,-3
"Damn this is a good fucking move, middle order goes infinitely stronger with Warner in it",16
Ready for one of Patty's 145kmh off breaks to clean bowl YJB as has become standard,3
How long has Kane W. been playing in the IPL? ~7-8 years?,8
Interesting choice with Kanos. This experiment i dont mind,8
"Brace for impact, kanos simps have hit r/cricket",27
"what is happening why is kane opening üòÇüò≠
2020 kaise din dikhaye hai",2
"Omg Kane opening is all I want

Let's goooo aboard the KANE TRAIN üöÜ",10
Rahul see this. Make gayle open today.,6
Why did Warner pussy out? Scared shitless of cummins?,-13
Kane is Lub,5
"Warner not finished with making tik tok

Hence sends Kanos forward",17
I am sure Kane get pissed seeing Morgan is Captain and just took the bat and come out to bat without anyone permission.,72
"Cummins vs Bairstow

Hmmm",4
"This is just madness, both Buttler and Warner not opening is just crazy, both must be average 40 - 50 in IPL as opener. Even if it works out in one game, it makes no sense in long term",9
"Kxip can do this and start with gayle and Mayank, if Rahul wants to play anchor since strike rotation will be easier at 3",0
Man!! SRH's tail starts right after NO 4,14
Who's the best bowler in the world across all formats other than rabada?,1
What's the thought behind Williamson opening?,5
Kane just wants revenge against morgan guys,13
What's happened to Davey? Surely Kaneo to 3 was all that needed to change,7
Who the fuck is shouting so much...,4
Oh maiden over ruined. Booooo,8
What is that horrible song they just played,5
Just tuned in. Is Warner injured or something?,3
"Bruh they played a catchy song in the first innings, Warner's probably busy with Tiktok rn",13
"Warner - You all wanted him to play at top , what's the problem now.",5
"Kanos exist:

r/cricket : *So anyway, i started nutting*",52
"Doesnt matter even if we loose today but i just want kuldeep to get back in form

Kkr is not quite Kkr without spinners choking the opposition",7

"If you have Lockie Ferguson, one of the world's premier pacers in the team, why would you not open the bowling with him?",1
"When did Warner last not open in any cricket match, any format?",2
garg should have opened . Williamson is too important.,11
Baz should replace Gill.,5
"Kane packing on the muscle
Since the world
Cup final according to comms",10
Watch Kanos aim every single shot directly at Morgan's face as an act of revenge,35
10 years of opening and now he demotes himself and how!! By taking out the only good middle order batsman they had. Do they expect Kane to bat the whole innings now?,6
"**KKR While defending 160+ target vs SRH**

Won : 4

Lost : 0

(KKR defended 180, 167, 171, 172)",5
Bairstow the leg side specialist,2
[deleted],2
Why are they playing Williamson if he's injured?,8
Kane a bit beefy now,3
if I was NZ cricket I'd be pretty damn angry seeing Williamson batting in this condition. Can only get worse...,11
Is Kane hobbling?,5
Is Kane hobbling a bit?,5
Kane is clearly struggling while running between the wickets!,6
Kanos' running is kinda sus,6
Oh no Kane,3
Williamson not looking good running,4
warner will attack the kuldeep yadav down the order,3
Kanos is hobbling. Is he injured?,6
The last time David Warner did not open the batting in the IPL was back in 2014.,5
I guess this injury means Kane is only sent to smash em in the pp and then get out,12
Kane opening so he doesn't come in middle overs as he can't run between wickets cuz injury I guess?,7
Why isn't Warner opening?,3
Williamson is limping there! Hope he feels alright.,5
Bat deep!,3
I have this feeling that Kane is not fit and already struggling.,6
Should have opened with Rashid instead. Should have said to go from the start. What would change with Warner in middle order instead of Kane. Both are just as important. It's just swapping places nothing else.,3
Kanos injured and sent to swing wildly in first 6? Dont think he can run,5
Guys am I crazy or Kanos is struggling a bit? What happened??,3
Kane nails it !,10
Shot,4
*Ohh yeah*,7
Kane running like his groin is chafing,7
So this might be the reason he was sent earlier can't rotate strike in middle overs,8
Williamson is out there to play like Gayle,10
Someone put Kane out of his misery,3
(¬¥‚äôœâ‚äô`)‚Üí,5
This is kind of target that is perfect for Williamson,9
Injury after injury. Seriously man 2020 sucks.,5
DONT STOP KEEP GOING,0
"After seeing a lineswoman in the Premier League yesterday, it felt good to see a woman umpire in the IPL. That feeling didn't last long though.",6
Is it just me or everybody in the field is shouting a lot?,6
"Marsh out, Bhuvaneshwar out, and now it looks like this might be Williamson's last game.   

Who does SRH have in the locker? Fabian Allen, Virat Singh, and Jason Holder. Not looking great for the stiff back end.",17
"KW is class. 

Period.",15
Never thought Williamson would be the enforcer,10
Kaneyyy,10
Hobbled Kane is still a badass,10
"‚ÄúKane injured? I‚Äôll just make him open lmfao!‚Äù

But seriously I think this is the right decision. He can go smash bang and score as much as he can in PP.",8
"Guys what are your thoughts on making changes every game? I don't see how it would be benefitting a team. Yea i mean if things are not working, sure. But they gave Banton and Green just a game and then dropped. Kind of same for SRH also",3
An injured Kanos just makes me sad.,9
"When csk fans sees willliamson "" is that ours""",18
"This might actually be a master stroke. If Kanos can play the perfect second fiddle to Bairstow we are sorted. 

1) Bairstow fires and we get a great start

2) Bairstow fails and Warner can come and stabilize",10
Cred ad is awesome,-1
"Kane on one leg is still incredible, amazing",11
Williamson should go hard in the PP. It would be difficult for him to score in middle overs with the injury.,7
I think SRH are gonna CHOKE harder than Kxip and RR without Kane in their middle order. They are the original kings of collapses lol.,9
"He doesn't need to run if he scores those boundaries. Or better, can he get out please? üëâüëà",7
Can't someone run for Kane if he's injured?,13
Kanos is a true team man,12
"This is how you play as an opener not that tuk tuk shit by Gill ,he was hitting 50% balls straight to fielders  .",13
"If this move succeeds, Warner will be the left handed ABD for us",14
"Kanos cant run 

He is just here to swing

Bring in rusell n start bowling yorkers",11
No Lockie yet?,7
These songs are bangers judge me for thinking it I aint ashamed,8
A lot of people were making fun of DC for getting everyone in the auction but their bench strength is so strong that they‚Äôre winning even after their key players are out.,7
Does srh want Lynn? Give us injured kane so we an retain him next season,6
Why not give Cummins another over?,4
Chakaravarthy ‚Äòwalking‚Äô out his run up was one of the more awkward things I‚Äôve seen in a while,3
Ena mairu pandhu athu,0
Cummins bowled so beautifully,8
Bruh dude is literally limping is it really a good idea to have him batting,19
A wounded tiger is the most dangerous,8
Damn the pitch be looking clean with all that sweeping,2
That's it jonny.,1
Cummins - I should have given chance to bat,6
Warner at 3?? Just because it's IPL 2020 doesn't mean that captains should go for IQ 2020 moves.,-5
Is KKR making SRH batting look like MI?,5
Kanos's wholesomeness reached ginger,5
Why isn't Ferguson bowling ? Bairstow didn't look comfortable against pace at all .,1
"Williamson gonna stand in one place and go for boundaries, really makes you think if the intense running that Kohli does is worth it which leads to batsmen like padikkal basically getting a heat stroke on the other side.",4
"Bairstow struggling against Cummins

Brings in VC

Morgan following Kohli n Smith??",3
"Brought to you in 2020:

Williamson the savior,
Williamson the bowler,
Williamson the opener

And

Warner the middle order batsman",20
Why not let Cummins have another go? 4 boundaries in the last 5 balls ffs!,2
Struggling Kane is more dangerous,6
"SRH and letting players play even when they're injured, name a better duo.",8
"Warner: not able to hit in the Powerplay. 

Williamson : Timing the ball from ball 1 in last few matches. 


Warner demotes himself and promotes kanos. This is such a logical decision. I don't why people are comparing this to stokes butler shit. Stokes did nothing to deserve the promotion.",9
He is wincing in pain,1
Dudley Bairstow >>> Jonny Bairstow,2
William is abnormally aggressive,8
Slightly disrespectful to Shubman by scoring this quickly,11
Williamson will go after every ball. This will be so much fun.,4
Last match for Kane? Doesn't look good tbh,12
"Wtf is wrong with srh management guy will get some long term injury if he goes like this, kanos being kanos will want to play they have to take him off",10
Why tf are they aggravating his injury! Have they learned nothing from the Marsh mishap!,9
Has the Kane train got wheel trouble ?,2
"Please just bowl Cummins and Lockie, no need to experiment right now",1
"I love Kanos opening!!

Warner did great there.",2
Oh no Kanos limping,1
Why would you play Kane in this condition? I think New zealand just announced their summer schedule! They can't be happy seeing this!,2
"I forgot the name fo England's other opener, what's his name ? Was he still in Delhi team ?",1
"Seriously man get Kane out of there, he could get really hurt",3
Ya I think kaney on top of a injury. I reckon nabi will come in for the next few games. Big bummer,3
Russell to counter Williamson,2
Sheep must have kicked back Kane and got him on his leg,3
"'Jonny Bairstow, yes he's belligerent...'

Wow don't hold back Bish",2
NZ just came,1
That placement was stunning.,2
Kanos is going to thrash todayüòÇüôåüèΩ,1
Has anyone won any voucher from the fantasy daily challenge? I came 94th in the RCB vs RR game and am eligible for a 100 rs voucher. Lol,3
Where the f is Cummins?,1
Man they should have taken Nabi if Kane was not fit 100%,2
SRH really unlucky this season with all these injuries,2
"Don't run. 

U got God like timing KW.",3
Ferguson :(,1
"Mitch Marsh first match

Kane now

Srh management seems to be the most selfish one",3
Are we gonna Kane mama too...? Noooooo,3
Morgan's captaincy in full flow. 1-over spells only!,2
That's beautiful.,3
Danny Morrison is truly talented at sucking off sponsors.,6
Williamson to get a 50 without running,8
Hope the injury doesn't get worse. This seems risky. :/,6
Kanos is an absolutely ridiculous cricketer,5
You've got to question the SRH management at this point. Playing them through injuries has already backfired for them with two players aggravating injuries and ruling them out of the tournament. And here we go again,5
"Guys, just logged in. Are we done roasting the Rockstar umpire?",3
You could cut off Williamson's right hand and he'll still nail that cover drive,6
Wow today for the first time I noticed the graphic that shows field placings with the field in green and players as blue dots... what an amazing thing! makes things so much easier to follow rather than having to imagine the field placings in the head. Anyone know when they started doing this?,6
Injured Williamson>>> warner,9
"Thala level tactics , KXIP level execution .",3
"Just when Cummins was looking promising, they decided to take him off after 1 over. Ughhh",4
Just tuned in. Why is Warner not opening?,3
Now Warner will come in later and not do much and people will say 0 brain move ignoring the fact that he's been bad all tournament,2
Eoin Morgan looking foolish with all these bowling changes,3
"Ah yes, let's not bowl our 2 best bowlers right now. Let's give an injured guy as many runs as he can get.",5
Gill needs to learn a loooooot from Kane!,7
"They should give Fabian Allen a chance next game for Williamson, he's like a Jadeja clone. Decent overs of spin, exceptional fielder and great finisher too.",9
"Never mind bairstow is going to bat through and Williamson is gonna be aggressive, I switched it around earlier",1
"Didn't a 79m six go out of the stadium earlier, how is this a ""huge ground""?",2
I hope Kane's injury is just a niggle and nothing serious.,4
The real Natarajan is actually Williamson with that one legged boundary!,3
Man get Williamson out of there. He‚Äôs struggling!,3
Like how everyone has more knowledge on niggle  than team physio and kane himself,11
What kind of injury does Kane have?,6
Man it sucks and so unlucky that 3 of SRH‚Äôs players have been injured mid game. If they knew before hand they should‚Äôve put Holder in,6
Kane Gayleson on the field,9
"Fuck this selfish team, why the fuck are they aggravating Kane‚Äôs injury even more?",10
Injured Kanos is gonna get a 50 just from boundaries and hobbled singles,10
"Kane injured.

""Fine, il get my runs from boundaries""",8
Why doesn't Cummins get dropped? 4 wicket less overs every match,3
Injured williamson playing better than other batsman.,5
"U got cummins n ferguson

But u open with mavi, Vc n Rusell",3
">Our Captain is Banned, so can you Lead? Sure. Manish is not Great at No.3, can you take that position? Sure. Our Middle Order is weak, can you do the finishing? Sure. We need an extra spinner, Can you Bowl? Sure. Warner wants to bat lower the order, so can you Open? Sure. That's Williamson for SRH !!

Srh fans showing their gratitude",12
Eoin Morgan following kohli school of captaining with all these changes.,5
Do or die match and our Kane is ready to die for his team T_T,11
Pretty sure SRH playing a half-injured Bhuvi in 2018 shortened his career.,7
"Idc what y'all say, it's Kane choice to come out and play, and he thinks he can smack a few instead of coming in later or not at all, then I am for it",9
"2 more overs. 

If Kane can get 4 boundaries in those 2 overs.  He's more than done his job",3
Why is Williamson not retiring ? He can bat at the end if required.,3
Warner batting in the middle overs is not a bad idea actually. >!For KKR.!<,4
I'm done with this braindead management if Kanos is out of the tournament after this match.,12
"Srh and destroying already injured players, name a better combo.",15
Kane with the serious Gayle vibes,5
Baz has stopped writing down lmao,10
Mcullum wasn't writing there!!!!,3
"*Hits ball straight to the fielder"" - ""crowd"" erupts.",10
Bairstow trying  everything to score at higher strike rate than injured Williamson. Still can't do it.,4
"If srh ever lets Williamson go, it will be the dumbest decision any management has ever made.",21
Bairstow wants it done quick,5
Williamson's the injured one but Bairstow batting like he's injured,1

Back to DK captaincy guys?,3
Josh Thumka lagao challenge üòÇüòÇ,2
"Seeing this as a neutral, Kanos is too good for SRH he would be far valued somewhere else, this is seriously pretty risky for him. As much as I can see they want to fully utilise him even if it means guy being out for the rest of the tournament. Shameful",6
"KKR'S captaincy evolved ,just backwards",2
Andre Russell is a part timer still tbh. He shouldn‚Äôt be bowling anywhere in the pp,1
"Huh, warner averages 43 batting in the middle order.",1
I reckon Kane will be going for boundaries even after 6 overs if he stays.,2
I think it's better for Kane that bairstow is on cus Warner loves to run 2 a lot,3
Kane is injured and KRK getting kicked out of playoffs. Everythink is linked.,4
How can you not love Kanos.,6
[deleted],1
So Kane opening is Pragmatic or Smart or Selfish from SRH management?,6
BaiRsToW Is OvErAtaEd,6
"Morgan just picking names out of a hat for bowlers now

He's gonna roll the arm over himself in a second",8
Kane will stroke silken fours in the power play and then get out trying to smash sixes.,5
"VVS left a note saving ""if you don't shave, I am hauling your Bogan ass back home"".

Unfortunately Bairstow intercepted the message before it reached Warner.",11
"Morgan captaining a side

N defensive start both in bowling n batting

Pre 2015 england vibes",2
SRH being too selfish,5
Baz is that student who pretends to write to please his teachers.(SRK),8
If kane goes they can bring holder in he has already cleared the hr interview with harsha.,3
Russel gonna score a 50 toady. One way or another,7
Why are they not showing the inside of the studio in dugout?,3
Beautiful,5
What a clean hit.,9
Loving Kanos going Berserk,6
SRH single handedly trying to end Russell' IPL mystic in all departments,8
Kane is pure class,5
Williamson is just God. There's a reason he's in the Fab 4,11
"come on srh lads you got this, i hope williamson macha plays big and gets srh home",9
Awww Kanos! Gorgeous!,6
BuT BUt  ........    MOrGAn iS a WoRLd cUP wiNNing CAPtaIn. FuCk DK. Hopefully some jinx,11
Why run when you can hit fours and sixes?üòÇ,4
Aggressive Williamson is a mood,8
I just love SRH going out of their way to accomodate Kanos.,8
Yesss SRH is taking the MI approach.,2
"I'm not watching the match live, just seeing the scores

I'm worried for kanos cuz I see he is running 2s with injury, does he look uncomfortable :(",1
Watching this team gives me a migraine,3
Imagine if Kane gets 70+ with an injury,11
Kane: specialist powerplay batsman,4
"Steroids are for kids.

~ Williamson",4
rooting for SRH because CSK :),2
You can't put a price tag on the commitment Williamson has put in SRH throughout these years. Should definitely retain him in the mega auction,8
"Lmao yes swaney, I looked at my own hand",1
I love YJB. Compilation of peachy balls swinging in from top international bowlers and there's not a single defensive shot in sight,3
This might be the single best decision SRH this year has made. Man if Williamson isn't agile,2
SRH is the first side in the history of cricket to play injured player. I understand fury over Mitch but Williamson is comfortable enough to play.,10
How badass would it be if injured Kane hits a century!,6
Kanos playing at 175 S/R. Seems like a great move to let him open.,1
Dinesh as captain used his bowlers much more sensibly.,3
Pat cummings's sister : no need to thank me.,1
Why wouldn't u bowl Ferguson with Cummins?? Why Russell,1
Kanos stroking Cummins.,1
"That's how you open an inning, my sweet summer child Gill!",7
I'm gonna be pissed if Kane misses the rest of the tournament,10
That Moana Umpire does umpiring old school way by crouching,5
Even a one legged Kanos is better than most batsmen out there,14
Can I have two injured Kane Williamsons in exchange for Jadhav and Dhoni?,10
Has Swann been fired after yesterdays F Bomb or is he still commentating,2
This is how PP should be played... Bit of aggression from both.,5
Williamson on one foot is still devastating when he goes for it.,6
"Kane Williamson should not be batting right now, it's only putting more pressure on his hamstring and can lead to a long term injury.",8
"While I bloody love Kanos in orange, I can‚Äôt wait for the next super auction just so we can watch him open more often",7
It‚Äôs been a lot of boundaries and singles with the Kane injury very different from the doubles and occasional boundary from Warner and bairstow,5
Can we declare NZ a universal treasure already,14
"Just logged in, what happened to Warner?",6
When did kane williamson get injured?,5
Injured Kanos vs World class bowlers > Peak Gill vs school level bowlers.,10
Pies,1
At this rate Baz will finish up 2-3 notebooks.,9

SRH openers already showing more INTENT than KKR openers,3
They are chasing like it's a 200+ score,3

"Bairstow : Fine, we won't run singles.",8
"Commentator: That is Cum-in's natural length.

( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)",5
Seems like YJB just needs an another aggressive batsman on the other end to fire as well. Maybe it's a confidence thing.,1
Only srh batting choke can win us from here,4
This is actually becoming funny now,1
They are chasing like it's a 200+ score,1
How did Kane get injured again? Missed it.,1
McCullum writing Fuck Fuck Fuck in his notebook,9
BMac is not good at strategies and kkr don't have fielding coach as no one dives at 30 yards circle,0

Lockie: Am I a joke to you?,5
Sanghi Mavi needs to bowl well here. Kane in murderous form.,1
[deleted],6
Has Williamson got injured batting in this innings or was he carrying a niggle when he came to bat?,1
They said Warner is a T20 specialist and Kane is too slow for T20s. How the turntables.,8
How has YJB not hit a single boundary on the offside this entire IPL?!,5
Harsha just commentates with a different enthusiasm when it's home team playing,7
Why is Williamson opening if he is injured? Hope this doesn't worsen his injury,3
Was lockie added into the lineup by mistake?,5
SRH naturally will slow down when pandey comes out to bat.,4
Why would you bring Lockie into the team and then not use him,4
I still don't understand how Morgan bowl Varun in pp when bairstow and Williamson are batting.,5
Why Lockie has not bowled an over yet??,3
What happened to kanos? Niggle or injured? Why is he opening,8
Someone remind Morgan that Lockie is in the XI today,7
KW injury has become a blessing in disguise in this chase,7
Wait KKR have Lockie Ferguson and aren't using him???,3
"Lmao, Kane is a legend",7
Turns out an injured Williamson has more game sense than Gill,11

Kanos is love. Kanos is life.,11
Kanos is playing terrifically so far‚úåüèΩüëèüèΩ,12
Kanos channeling his inner AB!,6
Kanos dominating with 1 leg working. GG to the goat,5
"So, i am guessing, they brought in Kanos to open bcos he is injured and he can trash all around the ground thereby having to run less (singles, twos). If he was in the middle order, he'd have to rotate the strike and run much more, getting injured more.",6
How much for a Kane Williamson body pillow?,12

Williamson always looks so elegant when batting!,8

Lockie big IQ didnt want Kane's leg permanently fucked for NZ matches,6

I've grown to like Bangar in the dugout lately,3
Wtf that's not Warner,11
Much better than the start Gill provided to KKR,5
Where is Warner?,1
Warner should bat at 11 and take it deep.,3
They'll have to kill the entire SRH fandom before taking Kane from us,13
Want to see Amir Khan bat against Ferguson,4
Get well soon Kanos,10
So Warner the Finisher‚Ñ¢ then?,5
Not too unhappy abt garg tbh. But hopefully they return to a solidified order,3
They are treating this match like they've already qualified .So much trust on KKR bowling,7
Lockie Ferguson has half the number of wickets of a certain 15.5 Crore signing after bowling just one delivery.,29
Breaking news- Warner going to play 5 down going forward in all the games,4
Batting Garg here is not a bad idea. He does better when not under too much pressure,10

Great Garg can now settle in and score. He is better this way. Pandey down the order is better.,10
Weird choice from Warner. Let‚Äôs see if it pays off.,3

WhTever the result please take us to the last ball for the result . Need an exciting start to Sunday,2
Paschim Pathak is the umpire with long hairs if you are curious,11
lockie wont play after narine returns. lets trade for sheldon lol,5
How do we blame DK if the world's greatest captain to ever exist loses again?,8
Can‚Äôt wait for Ferguson to take 4 wickets and to be dropped straight away and not play again and end up getting more wickets than Cummings in the season.,7
"Bruh Warner doesn't even look ready to come out, he isn't coming in next",4
"Yall wanted srh to fix their middle order, now their middle order has Warner and Manish Pandey. Fixed.",8
"Warner chilling with the boys, lmao.",18
Lockie already bowling at 150+ speed. I say drop Russell in the next game and play Narine,9
Ffs Warner is my Captain for today,8
Locki's deliveries seem like they keep getting faster as they get to the batsman,2
"2m ago I said, ""Kanos experiment is a success""....maybe I should STFU...its still a success but he got out right after I said that.",7
SRH digging a hole now,2
Pandey below 3 is a liability also at 3,1
Why is DW not here ? Is this strategy inspired by rcb dropping ab at 6 ?,3
Tbh that over could have been anyone and they would have gotten a wicket,2
Hmm I actually get it. Probably have asked Garg to play more aggressively then you still have Warner/Pandey/Shankar on the back end,11
WTF. Demoting himself way down the order. David 'Thala' Warner,11
Who's that death metal umpire?,12
Gayle as Floater- Yea can't get weirder                                              Warner as Floater- okay fuck,20

Pandey and Warner to finish it.",3
3 dimensional batting order,10
"Ferguson is a member of Warner's ""Dugna Lagaan"" team",10
"Replace Russell with Narine, when he arrives. Bowling will become much more stronger for KKR, and Narine has been showing better signs of batting form than DreRuss this season.",6
Is lockie potentially the fastest bowler of this ipl,3
Who will captain KKR if Morgan gets injured or need to go back? Will they go back to DK?,7
"They just intercharged their middle order and top order to fix their middle order

*Modern problems require modern solutions*",39
Not a bad move from Warner tbh. He was not striking pace as well as he was striking spin in this tournament. Him at 4/5 might turn out to be a masterstroke if he continues the plan.,6
"KKR changed captain, made wholesale changes in squad. But it is SRH which looks like a new team lol.",4
At this point I just watch KKR matches for DK's Tamil,13
OOTL - why is Warner not in?,1
What's the highest you've won in fantasy games ?,1
Lol was Barstow annoyed at dk for chirping too much ?,8
Why did DK apologize to Bairstow?,9
How is KKR still 4th for so long after playing so shit is mind boggling,7
Umpire is Indian Slash,5
Garg's short first class record is excellent,2
In auction Ferguson didn't put up any base price he just demanded brown people start paying double taxes,23

"LOL Karthik translates ""dot"" directly to Tamil",2
Just woke up from my afternoon sleep. Bc kya kya hogaya hai is match pe.,1
Warner >>> Thala,8
SRH lacks a powerful lower order batsman. I think you should trade Kanos for Maxwell. He'll give you a few overs and a gun fielder as well. Pretty please,8
"Warner knows that for achieving true legend status in IPL, you need to embrace the takedeep philosophy of Thala.",22
Dotendra Singh Dhobi,-6
Wait the umpire is not a lady?,10
"I hope Nabi replaces Kanos for the rest of the season, not Holder or Allen. Nabi gives the perfect balance to this team both with bat and ball, unlike the other two. (Holder will fail with bat more often than not and Fabian is just bits and pieces)",9

Kanos' beard is majestic.,10

How will they drop Ferguson now. Is it really over for Russell,10
Cummins sees Lockie - *Chuckles I am in Danger*,16
And we were playing Nagarkoti in place of Lockie all this while!!,7
Lol that's one of the worst shots I have ever seen,3
Warner tried to pull a reverse koach!,6
Ferguson!,3
"LOL, Lockie Ferguson has taken the same number of wickets as Lord Pat Cummins, and he hasn't even finished half his overs yet.",20
Ferguson having a great debut,6
"U guys praised garg to much, that's on r/cricket",9
That was a brilliant slower ball,6
Ferguson has matched Pietreat Cummins' season haul in 10 balls.,7
Ferguson > Cummins guys?,6
Choke,7
"**8.4** Ferguson to Garg, OUT, **tonks off stump with a slower ball!** Lockie is dragging KKR back into this with every over. **70-2**

Just send in Warner now ffs,6
Yes Lockie get in son,6

Garg WTF was that!,4
"If they drop Lockie, we riot.",2

Aaaaand we're back to warner-bairstow :D,12
Ferguson has as many wickets in 1.4 overs as Pat Cummins has in 9 games.,8

Play out lockie you cunts,4
this can be chaseable easily! but the wickets matter man!! if one of yjb or warner falls within the next 5 overs it is gng out be super tough for srh,3

Warner..I seriously hope this experiment works,2
"Priyam Garg missed simple slower ball and got bowled

PG: I always wanted to do that.",4
"Taking guard outside leg stump probably didn't help Garg. That ball hit off stump and he hand to reach for it, not sure what the thinking was there.",2
How good has been ferguson today btw,8
What do SRH do with Garg? He‚Äôs only batted well in 1 game out of 9 but adds so much to the fielding and has potential. Maybe one more opportunity or give it Virat Singh back to Abhishek?,6
"Try and run from it, Warner-Bairstow will still happen",9
Jonny and David not rotating enough strike this season. They haven't been too good in middle overs either,2
Just started watching this game; why is Warner coming in 2-down instead of opening?,1
Fergusan would be top post on r/30or50,5
"Lockie Ferguson is making sure he makes it impossible for Baz and Morgan to drop him next match.
That would mean KKR management has to have the hard conversation with Russell about dropping him!!
Hope they have the balls to do that",7
I hope Ferguson‚Äôs form and intent inspires and helps Cummins from the other end,2

Is Kuldeep Yadav injured??,2
I swear Pandey and Garg contribute to nothing but fielding,4
Cummins has 2 wickets in 9 matches. Unreal that they keep playing him,7
Ferguson in his 2 overs has got the same amount of wickets Cummins has got the whole tournament,5
No kuldeep wtf,1
Wasn't that an off cutter (not leg cutter as Swanny is saying right?),3

I don't think it's a question between Lockie and Patty. They should simply swap out Andre Russell and Narine.,6

"I know it's in hindsight, but imagine if KKR didn't buy Cummins for 15.5 crores,  backed Ferguson from game 1(bought at 50L), and spent the remaining money wisely...",10
It's time SRH gives more opportunities to Abhishek. Garg has not done anything exceptional except that one match.,5
"Oh no, who's next Pandey?",2
"It's better, that SRH paly Nabi/Holder in place of Bairstow, and let Saha/Kane open the innings with Warner.",1

"Warner did not get his moustache trimmer, now he cant get one bocs they are in a bio-bubble and cant go out to buy a new one. That is the only explanation why he has it.",2
What the hell guys? Another collapse on the cards?,4
"@ RCB Supporters -

Which team are you supporting today?",3
Is Ferguson the key that unlocks KKR ; ),7
Choke incoming,4
"Pandey and warner??

Get ready for another odi innings",3
That would had been 6 at Sharjah ground,2
The 4th team to qualify is going to be so much worse in comparison to the top 3 teams.,7
Wouldn't trust Pandey with anything. Match lost as far as I'm concerned,0
Time for some 3D,1
"Warner-Pandey pair is dangerous. KKR need to hold them back and dismiss them soon. Otherwise, they can turn the match too.",2
Funny how Lockie Ferguson taken the same number of wickets that Cummins (most expensive overseas player) took so far in 8 matches in this season from just 10 balls.,8
Kane did not limp out with a mangled leg for you all to collapse,10
[deleted],7
Bitches should not go extra now. Even 50 off 24 is do-able if 2 set batsmen are at the crease,3
"Our ex-players always play well against us. It was SKY the other day, hope it's not the same with Pandey today!",5
Kane was SRH's biggest gun and they fired it early. Now all they have are two small rusty ones and some stones and sticks.,9
Dinesh ‚Äòyoungster‚Äô Karthik,8
"For someone like as backstory like Varun C, it is as impressive as it can get. Well find Varun Chakravarty.",2
It's Warner's lack of form that will cost us the tournament. Warner went from a world beater to an average opener in the first half of the tournament. That's too much of a loss to overcome.,8
"Surely there's a better chant for Knight Riders other than Kay Kay Arrr! Kay Kay Arrr!!

I don't recall that being their proper chant. Its not like RCB... sigh",0
[Lockie vs Warner](https://youtu.be/JTpBboskhqA),4
Isse kehte hai tubelight chalna,4
Oh no baz can't take notes now,4
"I don't remember if Baz has won an ipl, has he?",4
Why were/are SRH chasing as if the required RR is 13+ rpo‚ÄΩ,3
We are choking this .,8
Kuldeep playing as specialist fielder,6
Did srh ever have a big hitter in their lineup ? I can‚Äôt remember . Maybe Deepak hooda ?,4
ORIGINAL KINGS OF THE COLLAPSE,7
"Up Next:
Warner vs Ferguson - Battle of the Moustaches!",3
Will narine even get to break in this team?,2
It's looking really difficult for SRH now with pitch getting slower.,3
Imagine if KKR had played Lockie since the beginning.,3
Lockie clearly an enlightened comedian with that shirt number,7
"**Lockie Ferguson in the Middle Overs (7-15) in the short IPL career**

Overs - 11

Wickets - 4

Average - 13.3

Economy Rate - 4.81 rpo

Strike Rate - 16.5

*Cricviz*",11
Cummins in our side reminds me of the times when Brett Lee played for us. I don't remember him picking too many wickets but his economy had always been pretty good,1
Is Kuldeep being kept for the tailenders,1
Random Sri Lanka cricketer name fact: Sachitra Senanayake's surname means 'leader of the army;' from Sanskrit 'sena' (army) and 'nayaka' (leader),3
Vijay ‚Äú2down at World Cup ‚Äú Shankar will take srh home,2
Ian 'Time to reproduce' Bishop.,1
"Knew we were gonna bottle it up when I saw we needed 105 off 79. Our batting line-up is absolutely pathetic except for Warner, sometimes YJB and Kanos. This shit has ruined IPL for me this year.",2
All this IPL has shown me is that except Delhi and Mumbai no one seems to dominate even in patches.,1
Fuck me I thought Pashchim Pathak was a lady umpire. Wtf!,3
Lmao DK lmao,1
Just DreRuss things... lol,1
"What do you all think about the top 3 playing a tri series with each other? Last year SRH didn't deserve to be in the playoffs with MI, CSK and DC. Looking at it this year, it seems likely that the bottom 5 are no way close to the top 3.",2
You can't bottle after getting 58/0 in 6 overs and that too in a 164 chase,6
"Thank you Karthik, well-done",6
"**David Warner batting at No. 4 in IPL - last five innings**

34, 44, 55, 61, 65",5
Really want Kulya to do well today,4
Lucky lucky...,3
DK sus oh em jeee üòØ,6
Kuldeep will be back with vengeance,5
Way to go Kuldeep,6
Young players are suffering from Thalavid at the moment,13
David Warner will have to show intent by the 12-13th over. He's batting well throughout the tournament so far but not as aggressive.,6
"After narine is ready to go, who do we drop

Our captain Morgan

Our best death bowler Narine

Our best batsman Cummins. 

Our highest wicket taker Rusell

A guy who has 2 wickets in 2 overs Ferguson",18
Fucking DK,8
Just tuned in.. why is warner batting in the middle order?,7
That was out DK. Oh Warnie got some pad on it. Cmon Kulee.,7
That was a corker from Cooldeep,3
Ferguson man !!,6
Did baz ever play with lockie?,4
Can r/Cricket meme Manish back into form please? :(,7
Pandey ji just score a 22 ball 49 and get out. Don't even think of making a fifty. Those fifties have not augured well for us.,9
Get fucked srh for mixing your lineups.,1
"Pat Cummins - 186 balls , 2 Wickets 

Lockie Ferguson - 10 balls , 2 Wickets",12
"wow, Eoin Morgan speaks really good Tamil!",3
It‚Äôs high time they drop Russel for Banton,1
Who should RCB supporters support here and in MI Vs KXIP match?,2
Kulya isn't going to bowl more than 2 overs. The amount of trust his management have reminds me of my office.,4
"RR,CSK, KXIP would want SRH to win today, gives them more of a chance.",3
Hoping for a kuldeep resurgence here,4
kkr is pretty bad when it comes to fielding,2
"Just joined stream, was checking your comments ? Can anybody explain to me about Kane's injury ? He got injured while batting ?",1
"""aayega yeh seedhe thokeha yeh "" 


Lmao",7
Fuck off you cringefucks,2
Lmao DK is shouting.,3
Mccullum interview suggests Narine might replace Russell. That might open the door for an Indian batsman to replace a bowler. Time for the beast Nikhil Naik to make a comeback.,6
"It's the **Boy who cried Wolf** for SRH now. They lied about his injury at the start of the season as an excuse to drop him in the name of team balance and now when they need him the most he's injured off the tournament for real. If I were not a SRH supporter, I'd call it Poetic Justice.",17
Karthik is a bigger motormouth than Pant,14
Karthik thanx for the pant nostalgia,13
Dinesh Karthik is channelizing pant,10
DK is talking more than when he was captain this game,21
Kuldeep's T20 international bowling average is 13.77 and economy is 7.11. Strange that his IPL record isn't as good. Averages 30 and an economy of over 8.,7
Why is Karthik trying to compete with Pant for the loudest WK?,12
Dk giving pant run for his money with all the talking,11
Commentators annoyed by DK as well.,7
Lol must be irritating for the batsman,5
DK giving Pant vibes.,3
"People who understand what DK is saying, can you translate some of the things?",5
Stump mic set so loud can barely hear the Dugout commentary over DK screaming lol.,12
Cork's optimism üòÅ,2
DK had a drink with Pant last night looks like.,20
Hope KY does well,1
Dk commentary > dugout commentary,4
KKR is a team of  individuals,5
Kuldeep finally looking in some good touch,5
Love the way kuldeep is giving the flight,2
DK commentary overlapping actual commentary,11
"DK on the stump mic to Kuldeep,

*Bat ke neeche, bat ke neeche dalte reh. Haath se accha aa raha*

T: Basically keep pitching it up with flight and its coming outta the hand nicely",5
"Is that the stump mic is turned on or DK is amplified his vocal chords? It's lot of fun of Tamil, Hindi and English combined.",12
Pandey's about to hit 2 or 3 brilliant 4s and then get out by giving the easiest catch in the world,5
Virtual guestbox antics are actually a plea for help by inmates held at gunpoint in a mental asylum.,5
Surprisingly DK is quite vocal behind the stumps. maybe second most vocal keeper after Pant.,6
"Imagine if this happens

Karthik: cmon kuldeep. *isko kuch samaj nai aa raha hai *

Warner (turns around) : *bsdk samaj raha hai chup kar*",19
"If we win this, give motm to Lockie or we riot.",8
Let‚Äôs bowl Cummins once here before we give it Kuldeep again,4
Karthik reminds me of Rizwan with all this shabaash shabaash,7
"Powerplay: 57/0 in 6 overs

Since then: 23/3 in 5 overs",17
Ffs kkr don't deserve kuldeep,0
Everybody talking about how Narine needs to come in but they cannot drop an overseas player. Bitch what about Cummins,6
Non captain DK trying to assert dominance.,9
üî•üî•üî•,3
Lockie is on fire.,6
Holy shit what a yorker,8
Lockie is shagging us ffs,8
The pace bowling in this era is a sight to behold. It's the best in a long time. And its evenly distributed across multiple countries.,4
Where have we been hiding Ferguson so far?,10
Fuck this shit. I'm outta here.,4
"Too soon but SRH chose to chase and their bowlers did well to restricted KKR for 163,if this continues then very well KKR ends up winning.",2
this is exceptional bowling,13
Whoa,6
Holy fuck,5
Lockie you absolute superstar!,10
"Banton, morgan, Ferguson and narine would be my 4 overseas",4
Match still in our hands unless we do a real ultra fuck up job,5
This is Awesome! Why did we hide this guy for so long?,9
The hell are those yorkers man.,8
Holy shit,3
Why was he not playing??,9
"Was a good season lads, see yall next year",6
What the ? Fergusongod for sure. Also worked his Jersey number well (69),5
Fast. Full. Straight. That's some bowling.,3
Lockie you beauty,5
How the hell has Ferguson been warming the bench the whole time???,5
So why the fuck KKR didnt pick this thunderbolt bowler in earlier matches?,11
Lockie is goated,5
Right in the blac... Block hole,1
Just fuck off,2
Lockie where were you all along mate?,3
Ferguson wants the Purple Cap real bad,3
lol what fucking shit from SRH,2
What a delivery! Holy shit!,5
If it wasn‚Äôt for Cummins taking up Ferguson‚Äôs spot KKR could have been second on the table,3
KKR next game against us & Narine will be also back.,3
Dream debut?,2
Thank god mi finished their matches with kkr,2
So playoffs are basically locked now,2
14 balls - 3 Wickets. Cummins has 2 in 9 Games. Lol,7
Damn Lockie!!!,2
"Lockie Good, upvotes to the left",8
He got Faf with the exact same ball in WC,2
148 kph yorker üëèüëèüëè Thank god they brought Lockie after our match.,5
Ferguson what is this bowling. We don‚Äôt do that here.,4
I low key love this Ferguson guy.,7
Jesus lockie has ruined SRH,5
Collapse after collapse. This is a small target after that start and yet we still have to shit the bed.,2
Nokia has been served üëä,4
Well it is a shit season,2
Kanos' hardwork in vain.,3
Yassssss Ferguson bowling fire here,7
Fuck this shit,4
Yeah play Ferguson after the half way stage of the IPL.,7
Ferguson mvp,3
"Fuck me, Lockie Ferguson at 50 lakhs. Daylight robbery",22
better late than never with Lockie. So glad we have him.,1
Bat is always at fault.,7
Just tuned in and what a delivery!!!,4
Safe to see the Kiwi pornstar has nailed his spot in the lineup.,28
Why was Banton benched after one performance FFS?  At least give the players a chance.,5
"Holy shit, this is a ridiculous outing from Ferguson",9
Kuldip Chahal combo hit its first real challenge in wc2019 against England and got taken to the cleaners by Roy and Bairstow .,1
Where were they hiding him he performed well in practice game also.,6
Manish Pandey is such a disappointment,6
Low key ferguson,6
X-factor^TM,3
wow what a sexy ball,5
"Ok, we are absolute shit and do not deserve to get into the playoffs of we can fuck up this badly after that brilliant powerplay",5
Express fast bowlers are so lethal. Crazy that Mark Wood went unsold.,3
No substitute for pace 148kmph Yorker.,3
Pandey can fuck off next season. Offers absolutely nothing with the bat,8
"KKR: discovers Ferguson's ability

RCB : *chuckles, I'm in danger*",9
Time for some 3D action,4
Lockie has now taken more wickets than Cummins in this IPL,17
Aight bois. Experiment flopped.,2
Inb4 Ferguson came out of syllabus memes,3
"**11.3** Ferguson to Pandey, OUT, **148kph yorker and see ya!** What a delivery. Wide of the crease, aimed for the base of off stump and through from under Pandey's attempted jab at that. He had the room and all but that was unplayable **82-4**

MK Pandey  b Ferguson 6 (7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 85.71",1
Goddamnit. Lauki Ferguson is back to collect his teen guna lagaan,14
LOLLLLLLLLLL pandey was looking at the toe end of his bat like bro u got zero bat on that,3
Moustache power,1
Why was this guy on the bench for half the tournament.,2
No way has Lockie did more than 15 cr Cummins in one match. KKR would have been better off investing that money somewhere else when they already had a better bowler.,9
Lockheed Ferguson is on the scene,2
jesus what a clusterfuck by SRH,1
$2.2 million apple pie vs. $0.22 million stump zinger,11
Ferguson has more wickets than Cummins now,5
Is that yorker hard to play?,2
Lockie has completely changed the way this KKR bowling attack looks just like Morris did for RCB,5
Warner to Pull a Dhawan?,1
"Ferguson and nokia at 50 lakhs is illegal, I hope the respective owners do some money laundering shit and give them how much they deserve",12
Toe crunching yorker please!!!,2
"Fudge man, KKR's gonna win it looks like and big recover their NRR. Horrible for the other 4 teams fighting for the 4th seed :(",2
No one is praising Eoin for his captaincy. They would killed him for his only one wrong decision,3
Shankar deliver with the bat like you did with the ball pls,1
"That was a 148 kmph deliver which went surrrrrrrrr.....

KKR have been an acid trip this season. From depressing lows to astounding highs.",4
"If not for Ferguson, SRH would've been cruising now. Mf single handedly fucked us over.",14
We need to keep Vijay Shankar in the crease now.,2
"Lmao Ferguson has already taken more wicks than pat, really terrible that he didn't get to play any matches before that, kkr's management is shittier than a fucking sewer",6
Now Narine can only replace Russell in this squad. You need to play Cummins and Ferguson every game from here on.,2
Ferguson shirt number is 69,2
Need a good 30 off 24 balls partnership now,2
Shankar with a 11 ball 50 now watch,4
"LOCKIE FERGUSON has already crossed the wickets of Lord 15.5 crore Pat Cummins this season. What a gem he is, and how superbly is he bowling. Why couldn't McCullum realize the potential of his Kiwi Mate earlier?",3
ShAnkar ‚Äúwc2019‚Äù Vijay,6
Can we also bat Kane at #6? Pls,3
*puts on 3d glasses*,4
They were holding this dude for Virgin Cummins,3
Lockie pls take a fifer.,3
"If they want to play Narine, Cummins should be dropped.",3
"SRH, ‚Äúin terms of good Indian batsmen, we have no good Indian batsmen.‚Äù",9
Manish staring at his bat as if it is the bat's fault. LMAO,6
Lockie always comes good when you bowl him after power play,2
Kkr suddenly looking like a strong contender in the playoffs,2
Goodbye SRH,3
Ferguson has taken more wickets than Cummins.,5
Thank you Lockie for exposing the Pandey fraud.,1
So Ferguson has been more impactful in 3 overs than Cummins has been in 8 matches. Hmm,11
Loki ferguson already equaled Cummins tally.,14
Atleast no tuktuk today,6
Will lose by 30+ runs,3
"So, KKR selectors gonna be feeling pretty dumb for not having in Ferguson before now, ay?",7
Lockie already has more wickets than Cummins.,10
This is so stupid from KKR to not play him till now,9
"Just wondering, which franchises bid for Ferguson in the auction??",8
Well boys 4D is here. Game set Match!,4
Inb4 3D boi rescues SRH.,6
This fall of wickets with barely any runs is embarrassing after that start,5
3-5 off 2.3 overs lmao Lockies letting the world know how good he is,10
So you're telling me 50 lakh Lockie has been more productive than 1550 lakh Patrick Cummins. It was bound to happen,8
Ferguson looks like a guy who will threaten you with a shotgun if you date his daughter in college,5
SRH batsmen throwing their wickets away to save their eardrums from Karthik's screeching.,7
Looking forward to Ferguson Effect (Cricket) on Wikipedia.,2
"Lockie is what they wanted cumdog to be, but Pat's been more like Dre.",13
Warner needs a 10 to register the fastest 5000 runs in IPL,12
Pandey : time for stick extension surgery,3
Chad Ferguson >>> Virgin Cummins,12
Great captaincy by Morgan giving Lockie this over,5
Russell has a big ego. He won't be happy with it but he has to be dropped in the next game,2
3D time,3
"Cummins 9 Matches only 2 wickets. Ferguson 1 match and 3 wickets already.



Bret Lee: "" Guys do you know Cummins doesn't have index finger also what's up with Bumrah where are his Yorkers?""",11
LMAO HOW THE FUCK DID SRH FUCK THIS UP,4
So we are back to 2014-15 kinda season of feeling shit?,5
"Tournament over, now top 4 will fight for top 2 position and bottom 4 will fight for pride",3
"Okay, now that this tournament is gone for us. Let Kane take a break. Time to experiment. Try out Virat Singh, Y. Prithviraj, and B. Sandeep. See how well Stanlake does because every other team's pacers are doing well. Maybe try out Bairstow at 5. Maybe try and strike a deal with another team to trade one of our players.",5
"In an interview with Ashwin on youtube, DK said he would sell Lockie to DC

Good decision to take away his captaincy",8
"Fantasy cricket is just shit, 45 points for Gill. Seriously?",4
Kane died for this shit -_-,6
Tearaway fast bowler in the first match of his season for KKR knocks out opposition left right and center. Ring a bell?,2
"Assuming Narine comes back next match, who will sit out? Russel or Cummins?",4
"If cummins find form, kkr will have a better duo then rabada and nortje",4
KKR will be hard pressed to drop Ferguson after this game. Wonder who will miss out when Narine comes back.,2
About time Warner does a tiktok dance when DK shouts! (like Miandad did with Kiran More),7
Just forget how much you paid for Cummins and drop him please,9
"Time for Shankar to show his 3D skills. It's not like there's a lot left of this match, but anyways",6
"It was common sense that Ferguson is a great white ball bowler. Absolutely terrible selection, benching him for so long.",8
Lockie Ferguson and David Warner look similar.,2
Lockie gonna be the leading wicket taker for KKR by the end of this match lmao,3
"Man, Lockie Ferguson is looking like a beast. Who's gonna get dropped to bring back Narine to the team?",9
Ok guys Lockie's stach  < or > his upright seam position ?,5
Looking forward to next match lol,1
Take Russell out for Banton and we should be a better team from here on,2
tuned in to watch ferguson over. Not disappointed,4
"Nortje and Feguson 50 Lakhs haha, In comparison Cummins 1550 Lakhs",13
Don't troll  Cummins. He can bat better than every other batsman in KKR,26
i wonder how wagner would fare in a t20 format,1
"If you told an outsider than KKR had bought the most expensive player in the IPL and that player was an overseas bowler, they would've said that the player was Lockie Ferguson, not Pat Cummins.

Also fuck it, I was supporting Hyderabad but now I just want Ferguson to get a 7-fer",8
Vijay Shankar coming in to assert dominance after he did the same with the ball,2
"Aggresive captaincy from morgan Bowling locki's 3rd rather than keeping him in death

Thats more like it",3
Wow. The choke is real but damn KKR were hiding a monster named Lockie Ferguson.,7
52-0 after 6 in a 164 chase and they collapse like this. Genuinely so disappointed with this batting lineup,3
"Loki Ferguson - Aaj mein kar ke jaoonga

T (kind of) : today I will do it",2
"Long post sorry-                                                                                    The interview with Baz was a bit of a shocker. They brought in Lockie after seeing that the 2 most succesful teams have a similar combination. This screams to me that they are extremely confused, if you dont have a strategy and kinda copying the other teams winning formula, well good luck. I had my suspicions but the interview just confirmed it.",9
"Ferguson is like, ""want me to warm the bench again?""",2
Trust in warner he can pull this off,1
Tripathi loves those jumping throws lmao,1
DK's shitposting behind the stumps is phenomenal.,9
Shankaranna it's your day please save us.,1
The sight of Kuldeep for the home team must be jarring. It's gonna be expensive,2
They need to target yadav,1
No way manish starts next match. Better play virat singh at 4,1
*Update* - Pat Cummins hasn't picked a wicket in his last 23 overs. Lockie Fergusson now has three wickets in just 15 balls.,5
"Ferguson took more wickets in 1 match than Cummins did this entire tournament. 

More importantly, it was at 1/10th the price.",6
"Why was Garg sent before Warner. Why don‚Äôt captains stick to tried and tested methods. Yes, Kanos had to be shuffled due to an injury today, but let others be",7
Is Davey out of form?,2
"Next time someone defends Pandey, I'll have you know you're an idiot.",5
Drop Pandey and give chance to any other young player like Virat Singh or Abhishek. Even his state team would not have supported him the way SRH management has done since last 3 years.,3
Dk is annoying as fuck behind the stumps.,8
Fergu~~son~~daddy.,6
Warner's timing is way off these days.,2
Scenes when Warner pulls out the sandpaper from his briefs and zips it over Karthik's mouth.,9
Lockie daddy .,5
Kuldeep suddenly looks competent with captaincy change. Coincidence? I think not.,5
"Hold on, just saw Warner 11 balls 6. Did he not open?",7
Ambati rayudu watching with bated breath now,3
DK is such a dick,0
"Warner is gonna get out now, he is getting anxious",2
DK had one too many Red Bulls looks like!,6
"For the love of God, just completely collapse and get this over with. Don't give me false hope.",3
Warner stop taking tips from Rahul and play like you usually do,2
Warner going to pull a Gill today kmon boys!,1
"Don't worry my biriyani boys. This year ain't for us. 
Mitch Marsh, Bhuvi, Williamson injuries form starting , Warner not in good touch , the less said about middle order and pace bowling is better. 
See you in next season",6
Just joined boizz why the fuck is Warner batting so low?,2
Just saw the score. Wtf Warner didn't open? I thought only RCB made braindead decision on sending Abd at 6. Looks like every team is playing for the memes.,2
Where was lockie all these days. Wish RCB had bought him mid-tournament,6
Warner is about to turn back and cuss DK out in Hindi lol,2
Abe DK chup kar bhenchod,4
Team management has been the worst this year. Half the team not offering anything in every match,6
Yeh chilla chilla ke sabko scheme kaun bata raha hai pitch pe,7
"When every other express pacer has been successful in UAE, what was the point in holding back Lockie given their bowling troubles? Especially after Narine was reported.",4
DK lol. We know you are multi lingual. Don't show off üòé,5
"Let's not troll Cummins.. He bats better than every KKR batsman as of now lol. As for his bowling, let's not forget Cummins is not the best white ball bowler but he's played the most important role in the bowling lineup of KKR i.e. to lead the youngsters.",8
DK is finally being a true caption xD in all three languages!,4
Moeen Ali absolutely destroyed last season. Hes never been the same since.,2
Just a reminder basil thampi is still the highest run scorer of the game so far at 46,1
Johnny Sin has just started following loki ferguson on Twitter,8
DK shit posting more than Pant,5
I think it's impressive how annoying DK and Pant are. Straight into the batter's head.,10
Just end this misery,2
"Gangnam style in 2020, wtf DJ",7
Reserve Ferguson for the last three overs,2
Lockie picked 2 wickets in 5 matches last season at an ER of 10.8. Any team would have looked to get a new pacer if their foreign pacer had such numbers.,4
Shanker can fuck off too. Can't wat to get rid of them all Laxman included,6
Warner to DK: Chup ho ja BSDK!,4
For David Warner to keep his head down and not say a word while keeper chatters away is like an Indian dude on his good behaviour at /r/worldnews.,2
From 106 off 84 to 75 off 42. We are shit.,7
Good guy DK making sure Kuldeep is confident so he flights the ball,7
"Bruh, Kane didn't came out despite his injury and gave it his all only for the rest of them to piss it all away",8
One good innings and DK being so fucking cocky and annoying behind the stumps.,9
"DK chirping behind the stumps ‚ùå

Pant chirping behind the stumps ‚úÖ",10
Lol Required RR was 7.5 end of 7 now it's 10. It's reverse of how you chase.,2
"Warner's so fast he can milk a lot of singles into two's. And an occasional boundary here and there, very winnable as long as the RRR is under 10.",2
Every Australian top order batsman wants to be thala this season,4
"Morgan is a perfect example of a great captain. Not showy, in the background, tactically astute and backs his players fully.",2
Pant: finally a worthy opponent . our battle will be legendary,3
Chup BSDK,2
Bring in Vc n bowl one more of Kuldeep,0
"With the inclusion of Ferguson, Narine's call for suspect action feels like a blessing in disguise.",8
Kill the DJ plz,7
The fuck is wrong with Warner man,3
Dinesh Karthik speaking in Hindi since Vijay Shankar is at the crease,6
"Karthik speaking in Vijay Shankar's tongue to mess with him.

Unluckily he can't speak Bogan to mess with Warner's.",14
What do people here want? Keepers talk to the bowler. It's not a problem.,8
Lifebuoy ad was cringe as fuck,2
Bruh Cummins is being played like under 19 Indian bowler,20
Gaand me daal le apna JOSH,5
My man Kuldeep bowling with some confidence today. :'),7
Can we mute stump mike,0
"Finally Boundary, a relief to Warner",3
Lockie wouldve played earlier if they hadnt paid 15.5 cr for Cummins,13
SRH screwed up big time. Even a blind man can see their middle order is non-existent without Kane. Then they took him out and put a struggling warner in his place. What are they smoking lol.,2
2014-2019 Warner would finish this by the 18th,12

"Its an unofficial job of WKs to piss off batsmen in to playing rash shots, if he is annoying you guys also, he is doing a bloody good job",10
Cummins has completely lost touch. Bit sure what's happened to him.,2

I watch IPL to listen to nostalgia inducing songs between overs,8
"If KKR win today (which is almost guaranteed) then the top 4 teams to qualify will almost be set in stone - MI DC, KKR and RCB unless the latter two go on a massive losing streak.

I also have a feeling that KKR is going to win the IPL, I can totally see them shithousing and fluking their way to the final like they have done all this season and then pulling one more performance out of nowhere to win the trophy.",22
David HOPE Warner,3
First foreigner to score 5000 runs. If they consider innings then he will be better than Indian players as well.,6
Hopefully this match is exciting bocs the next match will be \*yawn\*.,10
"Imagine if wicket keepers get paid endorsing products via stump mic.

DK - Chakravarthy, great ball. Sahi hain, sahi hain. Mutual fund sahi hain.",42

"Really want KKR to win if RR don't qualify, which is looking unlikely.

Shankar walking wicket here!,2
I want fast bowlers to bowl for the rest of this innings so that DK is out of reach of the stump mics,4
[removed],8
Shankar really needs to show off his batting dimension today,2
Warner needs to do an AB for them to win this,5
Unpopular opinion: turn up the volume of the stump mic,11
Is this 2020 Warner the same as the older guy?  Don‚Äôt think so,2
Shankar is poor mans pandya,3
"Serious question, has anyone ever seen a single good innings from 3d",5
Test match figures from Lockie,11
For a moment I thought it's catch.,4
Vijay Shankar looks pretty underconfident,6
"The easiest formula to build your team in IPL is MI formula. Two overseas fast bowlers, one indian. Two indian spinners. And one seam overseas allrounder in top 6. I reckon after a while most teams will start to build their teams in this way in auction.

E. just to add to this, MI did this first in 2013. Johnson, Malinga. Rishi Dhawan as third indian seamer. Bhaji and Ojha. And Polly as our allrounder. Ever since then we have almost always followed this formula. We won for the first time in 2013 btw.",6
I don't understand how we are 4 with the shit performances we've put in. Like it's mind boggling,7
Shankar redemption today?,0
"Warner and Dhoni competing for who can be the most brain-dead, incompetent and irrational decisions in a game 



I'd be happy to be proven wrong here but this is easily one the stupidest moves I've seen a captain make. These lot are making KL look competent",-1

Hoping for Warner to do this to keep the tournament a bit more interesting.,3
Can someone tell the amount Shankar was bought during Auction?,3
Stop giving me hope god damnit,9
"Despite everything RR is still around 10.5 rpo only. These two are doing the sensible thing. 

Get the equation to around 48 needed off 4 with Warner and Shankar batting. Samad and Rashid in the shed. Gives them a fighting chance.",5
"If you see Shankar bat in domestic circuit, you wouldn't believe it's the guy everyone trolls. His average won't blow your mind away. But the poise and range he shows while batting, is just extraordinary. Far better than what misinformed people make him out to be.",4

SRH fans just too pessimistic.",8
Loving the hard-hitting journalism of the IPL FanPoll^TM questions. Asking whether Danny Morrison looks better in a hat or a waistcoat deserves the Pulitzer.,7
Fuckin drop him already. Cummins has been worse than dead weight in the bowling department.,1
Shubman should try to do what Warner and Bairstow do. Steal runs. Don't give chance to bowlers to build pressure with dot balls. It also frustrates  non strikers.,5

Although it's hopeless but still think a SRH win here is good for tournament. Jai jai Shankar.,4
Who was the other team going for Cummins at around 2 million dollars at auction? Stupid management that too like KKR üò≠üòÇ,2
"Cummins figures are looking good. 0-20 in 3

He's conceding lots of leg byes. Lol",4
"Chahal is on second position for purple cap. He will ALWAYS get wickets. He's not so threatening that the team will play him out, but he's a damn good bowler who will always have a good economy regardless of if the opponent attacks him.",7
"First 36 balls 58-0, next 48 balls 43-4",8
Cummins cannot bowl after 10th over at all.,4
So does Narine has to wait now or he comes straight back into the team?,1
I would like to introduce to a revamped Cummins- he's a batting all rounder,4

Either the batting team wins even after wasting it 
Or Bowling teams wins it usually chase being 30 to 45 runs in 2 overs",9

Warner u tit dont fucking do that again,4
Can anyone link me to the latest post where it had %age chances of teams making it to playoffs,1
There are more porn staches in this match than in r/classicXXX (NSFW obviously),7
Warner playing reverse sweeps has been disastrous this year,1
"I'm still wondering what KKR management where thinking by getting Cummo for that much. He's good upfront that's true, but he's almost a liability at the death. His pace is also part of the issue, he's fast enough so that the ball easily comes onto the bat to be dispatched (especially off his standard back of a length delivery), but he's not a  consistently 145kph+ bowler like Nortje or Ferguson who can overwhelm batsmen by the sheer speed of his bowling.

If he went at a lower price I'm sure that he'd be playing far better than he is now, he currently has to deal with the pressure of performing every time for a high price which he did not demand himself.",6
WTF! Kuldeep bowling well. He deserved that wicket,1
"Do you guys even like the look of this Altroz car? I mean, it's better looking than most Maruti cars, but still not that good enough to deserve so much praise.",1
Why is it fucking Chakravarti every time ?Always that dude when catches are needed,3

Do you guys think warner can do a ABD?,0
Varun ‚Äúold monk‚Äù chakrborthy,5
Russell must stay away from bowling..,1
"Thanks, varun. Very cool.",2
I want to know the stats of Warner playing reverse sweep. It seems like he always gets out or almost out doing that,4
Is this the inflate-deflate strategy,5
"as a kiwi its one of those things i hate about david warner, but hes one of, if not the best batsmen at running between the wickets. he steals so many runs and is always searching for that extra run. just a stupidly good player",16
"Russel sprints 20m, 
His hamstring: hold my acid",1
Varun is a poor fielder though.,2
"3d bro, what is you doing?",6
Chakravarthy has the resigned look of a man who has seen 14 million possibilities but none had a positive outcome.,7
That didn‚Äôt look easy at all,0
When was the last time kulya got 4 overs in ipl??,-1
No Rusell for death overs. This is interesting now.,2
"Reverse sweeps are so risky, why would you do this so early on in the partnership",3
Pat Cummins was decent in 2017 ipl with 15 wickets at 8RPO and he's has only improved since then. Don't know why he is failing this hard in 2020. He was playing decently for Australia in t20.,1

Now Rusell injure

SRH wants warner to be ABD but all he is doing is thala.,4
Cummins 15 runs off the over incoming,0
Great defense Shankaranna,1
"This is really impressive bowling by Kuldeep. Usually after you're dropped all you focus is on trying to bowl darts and a defensive line and getting away with impressive figures on paper. 

He's doing the opposite. Flighting every ball to Warner, bowling it slow and trying to goad him into playing a big shot. Going for the wicket regardless of his own figures.",3
"Based on how this tournament has gone for this sub, Pat is going to get 4 wickets now.  

Edit: 3 to go.",4
Shankar cant bat cant bowl.. Manish Pandey is a better all rounder than him,4

"Cummins will relax now...3rd wicket of tournament after so many matches...

Ferguson man damn!! 3-8-3 his figures right now",3
Man we just don‚Äôt deserve playoffs at all. Our Indian batsman are the worst in the tournament and we have the worst pace attack. Luckily next IPL should be is 5 months away and we can address our team before then. I wouldn‚Äôt even mind us getting Rahane just need someone with consistency.,22
Can Warner pull off ABD mode and win this match for SRH?,1
What happened to Shankar lol? He was so good before that injury in WC last year. Thought we have found good no. 5/6 player who can bowl as well,2

Thats some reading of the game.",3
Can Warner pull an ABD today?,3
Idk How on earth Shankar is a better player than Abhishek?,1

1-28 is not bad from Cummins despite all the trolling,4
this mf just spanked that for six while the entire english line up got clapped by this short stuff in the 17ashes,5

I'm just scared at how KKR is always squeezing everything out of Russell.,4
Samad exceeded Shankar's score in like 4balls,9
Samad has already tonked both Bumrah and Cummins outta the park in crunch and he's barely started. Push this guy to the moon.,15
Saved 2 runs,6
Russell is like Thanos... inevitable,5
Tripathi is love.,3
I love how Swann gets triggered by the third umpire needing a billion replays to make a simple decision.,9
Thera pyaar pyaar pyaar hookah bar,2
LMAO WHO IS THIS UMPIRE BWAHAHAHAH,4
Umpires hair and stance is making me giggle.,5
Bruh there is one person in the circle on the offside and Warner hits it straight at him.,3
"**Abdul Samad's sixes this IPL against**

2 off Bumrah

1 off Nortje

1 off Cummins",11
Cmon Srh win this and make the tournament more interesting.,-1
How did Taher Shah make it onto the ground?,10
Yesterday last over from morris has won the game for RCB. he gave away 4 runs and took 2 wickets.,4
I cannot understand how our selectors thought Vijay Shankar was good enough to play at No.4 for India,6
Next ball is either a six or wicket,1
120-5 and warner is still there? wtf,2
Get rid of Pandey and Shankar. Never liked those two. Get Nabi in for warner or Kane. Bairstow is atleast stable.,1
weird seeing warner at 22(23) in the 17th over. is this the lowest he has batted..ever?,7
So... we all gonna say anything about the umpire's hair or just let it slide...?,11
what happened to all those ipl prediction forms that were on this sub before ipl started?,2
Shot boy,5
Srh only have 2 overs after this to attack. No way Lockie is giving away many runs.,2
Ma boy Samad got some power,3
"I remember during India's tour to New Zealand in 2019 before the WC , just because Shankar managed to hit some boundaries and pick 2-3 wickets, the selectors went mad over his performance. India already had 2 all-rounders , they needed a decent middle order batsman, still picked Shankar over Raydu and that's what caused us the WC.",2
Lmao swann,1
Damn Samad is really something,3
"Samad's sixes this IPL - 2 off Bumrah, one each off Cummins and Nortje

*ESPNcricinfo*",4
This feels set up for a Warner hero show...,2
Kashmir to Kanyakumari on the pitch,9
thats power,2
Samad from Kashmir üí™,4
Samad have my children,6
My money is on Russell trying to bowl next over but pulling out again before first bowl. I've seen it happen numerous times with hamstring injuries. Sad truth.,1
how many leg byes did Cummins bowl? his stats are good but damn he felt expensive at times,3
LMFAO Pirate Umpire Swann.,15
Samad is being a pain in the ass,2
Hotstar crashed,10
DK has been the best Indian WK/finisher in this IPL,5
SRH have lost this match. They don‚Äôt have a match winner down the order like AB or Pollard,4
LMFAO Swanny,2
Bruh Sky just briefly shat the bed,10
You don't dive for that Mavi? wtf.,2
"I know we're playing against SRH ,but Samad is a proper pinch hitter gives SRH good balance .",7
Abdul Samad for President!,6
Samad exudes big dick energy,5
OK I'm getting a little scared,13
2020 is year for Irfan Pathan. Dhoni doing bad and Samad doing pretty well.,8
"""Imagine having a high strike rate and having to drive around an Altroz""  

-KL Rahul, probably",17
"I don't even care if we lose, it's nice to see Samad batting this well. SRH desperately needs someone like him.",21
Dk the real captain??,5
Tuk Tuk Warner.,5
Thala Warner charging up for one final blow,12
"Ok I got my answer to an earlier question
Samad is the power hitter in srh team !",6
Need 1 more wicket,2
What's up IPL captains playing Tuk Tuk in this year's IPL?,9
Tuk tuk Warner? Why have a lot of players become Tuk tuk this season? Is it because they have gotten older or the pitches in Dubai?,1
Warner take us home,2
Learn Tamil in 4 overs...Dk - Varun crash course,10
The umpire is performing ACDC in the over break!,1
When do we bowl Lockie? 19th? Or try to get a wicket now.,1
"Get 7 of this over 

Keep 30 of last two",3
AB chased this in two overs,6
Has Tewatia been the best Indian finisher this tournament?,0
someone needs kill the DJ he thinks he's centre stage,0
Warner se nahi Samad se darr lagta hai sahab,1
Lockie going too early maybe?,1
37 runs from 18 balls is doable,3
My stream going slower than Warner... living life at 0.25x speed,3
"Wicket incoming 

Gotta make it interesting eh",1
What happened to warner?,2
Is samad an indian?,-10
"The music being played at the ground is so bizarre, the occasional modern techno drop mixed in with AC/DC and Boney M",5
"So Warner wasn't playing slowly because of the middle order, thats just how he bats these days.",5
Lockie jersey number 69. Nice..,5
SRH was winning when Vijay Shankar wasn't available. His inclusion makes batting weaker in comparison.,5
Ferguson should have been saved for the 19th?,2
Ferg > Cummins,0
Sunfeast dark fantasy is the shit! Best biscuit around after pure magic chocolate cream biscuit!,0
Swann should change his job title from 'commentator' to 'verbal and visual shitposter',8
Lockie Ferguson is a right arm off spin bowler,0
Russell's going to bowl the next over or final over,1
Warner biding his time. Makes me really uncomfortable,2
Eoin Morgan is like my dotted line US manager. DK is the Indian manager who does my appraisals.,6
Guys I can't watch the match. Can you tell me if Warner is struggling or just taking it deep. Theoretically he should've been able to hit the legspinner in this over.,5
"Fairplay award is a sham, fuckers are biased",5
Atleast samad is trying to hit every ball out of the park . Respect the intent .,2
Lockie with 69 as his jersey number. *Nice*,7
Should have bowled Mavi and bowl Lockie at 19th over.,3
"Idiot, just run single",2
Whatever happened to David Warner?,3
Boumcer at 150 ?,2
Nah we aint winning this,5
Just realised Lockie‚Äôs jersey no. is 69 lol,5
Please please just play Ferguson out,4
Ferguson is on fire.,3
Hope the other matching is interesting ..This is a borefest,1
Should have held back Lockie for the 19th,1
Did warner not open? How has he faced only 24 balls?,1
Wtf was that random sudden zoom?,1
CSK is still in 4tg lmao,3
How is CSK not last in Fair play?,5
Warner striking at 100 though,2
My ethical bois CSK sitting at 3rd on the fair play table,6
Petetion to bring Kane as captain for srh.,2
2 balls Warner just take a single,1
Low-key Ferguson has been really good.,4
Aw man... Lockie would have gotten another,4
"Samad hits one boundary and suddenly everyone is on his nuts. I don‚Äôt mean to sound like a cunt, but I genuinely have not seen him with much technique or even timing, he just mindlessly swipes his bat. We shouldn‚Äôt have released Pathan",3
[deleted],-5
"Warner 24 (24)

Needs to do better",3
"Ferguson is going to get a nice bid next auction, but he needs to leave ASAP

avoid hurting his value",6
[deleted],2
Ferguson is the best fast bowler right now.,1
Andre Russel is big fan of Samad.,5
Why have they only started using Lockie this game?!,5
"69, nice.",2
If you bowl really fast you automatically become cool.,10
"If SRH want to win they need to be chasing less than 15 in the final over, ideally less than 10",6
"Can't bat, cant't field, too injured to bowl. Guess who?",7
damn Ferguson could've had four for 11!,5
Russel ko ghar kyu nahi bhej dete. He gets injured every match. Let him recover.,2
Lockie showing Warner how to rock a moustache properly.,3
This is all on Warner now. 24(24) is just not acceptable when you are the best batsman of the team,5
"Q: Why IPL captains playing tuk-tuk this year?

A:  ""Aisehi.. sexy lag rha tha""",8
Warner and Ferguson look like brothers to me,1
Petition for commentators to stop using the word ‚Äúniggle‚Äù especially when talking about WI/SA players,2
Fine both teams  for slow  over rate. What the hell is this,3
34 in 14 is actually doable if Warner stays till the end like what Dhawan did yesterday,2
 L A C H L A N,1
"Warner can't get away a full toss. 

WTF",1
everybody except ABD struggling with their SRs,7
"With so much ~~roids~~ whey protein in his body, you would assume Russell to be the fittest person on earth but he is a walking injury.",2
"Man, in this ipl.... batsman are struggling to hit *full toss* for boundary.",6
Drop Russell for Narine,1
Shouldn't Mavi have bowled this? If Russell can't bowl then it would be same scenes as last night,0
Warner is in terrible touch. Not possible.,3
[deleted],8
Kinda nice that another match will start after this one ends without any pregame bs,11
That‚Äôs a no ball isn‚Äôt it?,5
Ferguson lagaan maaf nahi karega!,6
It's a wig...someone should pull the umpire's hair just to make sure...and see how many fair play points you lose,4
Who‚Äôs camp would you rather be in here?,2
Amazing spell from Ferguson,21
Almost any other team could chase this down but not SRH,7
Let's hope Morgan won't do a Smith,3
"Warner's power and strike rate has been on a decline since 2017. And this year, we are seeing the worst of it. I just want the old basher back.",0
SRH need an AB now.,8
Did warner forget how to hit boundaries,9
"Only RCB,DC and MI have solid performances coming from middle order. That's why they are at top obvio",6
Come on SRH make Kalinithi Maran Happy,2
"30 off 2, with 1 over of inexperienced Mavi, SRH favourites here",2
Whata spell Fergie,1
Someone show this over to Unadkat and tell him that slower deliveries only work when you've got pace,10
Warner emulating Kohli here,3
If Samad pulls it off....his career will get a huge boost.,1
What a fantastic spell of bowling. 3/15 with an economy below 4 and no boundaries. KKR would be mad to drop him,3
Russell should have tried to bowl 18th and Ferguson 19th with Mavi finishing. Now if Russell can't bowl they'd be in the position CSK was yesterday.,0
Swanny's friendship with Altroz is over. Pirate umpire is his new best friend.,2
Who is going to score 20 runs in one over?,1
"If they keep taking twos like this every ball, SRH fans won't have to be disappointed till the last ball.",1
"Don't do what RR did yesterday, bowl your best bowler the 19th. Don't keep him for the 20th over.",2
Can Samad do a mini Tewatia here?,3
Samad can't handle the heat,3
Honestly I'm relying more on Samad to finish this match if we wanna win than warner. Waner last year would put that full toss to six 8/10 times,2
"Come on cowards

Bowl kuldeep next",4
Maybe a nitish Rana over to confuse the opponents?,3
Never felt so unconfident with Warner on crease.,7
Warner works only in India,5
It's Mavi with 19th?,3
Not bowling out Kulya earlier is making me angry. Dude needed the confidence and he was bowling well ffs.,2
30 off 12 is hard but KKR doesn't have dependable bowlers left and Russell isn't 100 percent. doable,6
Does kkr has a unadkat??,3
"I think KKR should replace Gill. He's striking at 120. He plays nearly 20-30 balls everytime. If you think in terms of overs he scoring 30 in 5 overs in T20 match, which is 25% of their batting. He should get a move on once he settles or give others a chance.",1
"I jussst tuned in, but why the fuck is the greatest IPL batsman of all time, who's also a specialist opener, batting at 4????",0
Samad is just 18 years old man. SRH will be stupid to release him in the auction,1
"Ferguson has 69 on his jersey.

nice",2
"""He likes bowling spinners in the last over""",3
ferguson here really for the 100% lagaan,5
This match really shows how badly KKR have fucked their team selection this year,2
Warner‚Äôs timing is not good this tournament,0
For whose benefit are they playing the bollywood songs?,2
[deleted],-3
Smith made this mistake yesterday. Why is Morgan copying it.,2
Expecting a half-fit Russell or the wrist-spinner to bowl the last over is very brave,2
Samad De Villiers vs Jaydev Mavi,3

Shocking ball,1
"The amount of dissing of the DJ made me unmute. If you want to play ""Ankhiyon se goli maare"", play the original. The new one sucks donkey balls.",1
Mavi is a terrible death bowler. Bad captaincy.,2
wtf is this bowling???,1
"Honestly, if Warner doesn‚Äôt bring this home, I really think he should be benched and have the captaincy handed to Williamson. He hasn‚Äôt been performing at all and is not good for the balance. It‚Äôs the only way they‚Äôre gonna make playoffs, unless he steps up",2
Umpire is Paschim Pathak,3
Come on Warner. Now or never,2
"The amount of dissing of the DJ made me unmute. If you want to play ""Ankhiyon se goli maare"", play the original. The new one sucks donkey balls.",3
Warner doesn't want strike here lol,2
Lmao Jonny looks like a kid without beard. From bear look to boy.,3
Samad in place of Shankar would have made this easier,3
Samad make us Hyderabadis proud ffs,2

Who's gonna bowl the last over ?,2
I thought after yesterday the concensus was to bowl your best bowler in the 19th...,0
Anyone else here an anti natalist?,0
Vijay shankar must have nudes of srh owners. There's no other way to explain why he's in the team.,-2
I will dance naked if SRH wins,7
"WHAT IS HAPPENING? PLEASE KKR, DON'T SCREW THIS UP!!!",1
Want DK's team to win but an SRH win would make the points table more interesting,0
I thought after yesterday the concensus was to bowl your best bowler in the 19th...,2
[deleted],2
KKR did well so far,1
Swann is funny in a corny kinda way but sometimes he should skip the jokes and focus on the game especially during the important junctures of the match,3
No matter the result that umpire should be man of the match for that gorgeous hair.,3
Bairstow doesn't look like someone who would headbutt you with that full shave,1
"Bravo injured CSK lost

Russell injured KKR ____?",1
"You know as crap as Unadkat must have felt yesterday about fucking up, at least he's already known to shit the bed sometimes when bowling at the death and people won't be expecting much of him. With youngsters like Mavi, the very last thing they want to do is fuck up badly at such a young age and thereafter be labelled as a crap bowler",5
Team captained by Smith bottom of fairplay table üôÑ,2
REMINDER: DK is not the captain anymore!,4
"YJB looks so young now, it's very disconcerting",3
Really wish they turned down the awful spectator noise.,4
Trevor Bayliss doesn't look amused at all.,1
"Come on SRH ,keep IPL 2020 alive",4
Who's the umpire with the long hair?,1
U N A D K A T,0
Extremely risky to leave the last over to a half fit Russell.,1
Watching the umpire is like watching the Laxmi Bomb movie trailer.,7
That umpire has glorious hair. Wish I had hair like that.,0
Warner you goddamn bull,2
Abdul samad will be our budget ABD,5
Warner coming at no 4 is not a bad idea. He and bairtow are like the only players in srh who have strength to hit sixes frequently,3
"Some news channel is probably stationed outside the door of Samad's house, so they can barge in and interview his parents as soon as Srh win",10
Who is bowling the last?,1
He‚Äôs bowling well fam,2
That's some masterclass pressure bowling by Mavi,2
Morgan is going to give the last over to a wrist spinner,6

Ferguson you madlad,8
Swann and 3rd umpires !,2
fucking Ferguson has been a charm today,2
Gavaskar Jr can't wrap his tongue around penultimate,2
FERGIE ON FIRE!,3
The look on the umpires face is hilarious,7
DK is pretty good captain.the problem is people always just opiniate his batting skills!,1
What a catch,1
Lockie deserves Man of the match for this performance,5
What kind of instructions are usually sent at this moment from the dug out (gloves change) ? #genuinequestion.,3
I have a feeling Swann wont be coming back as a commentator next season. Hes a bit of a loose cannon. Suggesting that Warner mightve asked the umpire if they can split the bounty if SRH wins isnt cool.,4
Hope that is a clean catch. Need that dot ball.,2
We‚Äôre seeing this everyday,4
Fucking Lockie is fucking us over and over again,6
Them hair tho*,2
Lockie has single-handedly won this for KKR,6
Motherfucker,2
That‚Äôs out,1
Tf the umpire is a dude?,3
Lockie can do no wrong,1
Who is this scary umpire,5
We see one of these every game lol,6
Last over Russ or Kuldeep? Is Russ back on the field,1
Okay then Rashid time to do a 2018,5
it looks like he touched it,6
Kuldeep or Russell,2
Samad is just 18.  Man that's a solid Indian team prospect right there.,18
Samad c ~~Gill~~ Ferguson b Mavi 23(15),8
ffs,3
Ferguson can do no wrong today,6
"Morgan n kane against each other

Last over finish

First time??",17
Damn what a fantastic (regular) catch. This may turn out to be the difference.,9
Oh god,2
"CSK bros, give me a hug",5
Puji pickle juice anyone?,1
"Simple direct catches are not normal thia season, either you drop it or take a hard catch",10
I like this hairy umpire's signalling. None of those half ass signalls we see from some. What a man,7
I know its difficult to get a haircut during Covid but that umpire looks like has hasn't got one for 5 years,13
"lockie has had one hell of a game, hes everywhere",10
Ferguson has been a god for KKR this match,10
Why is the umpire wearing his Waynes World Halloween costume already ?,5
What does it rock and roll mean actually?,3
Gill has alpha energy,2
The camera angles really sucks,4
LOCKIE GOAT,8
"Wait, if Russel is injured, does that mean that Kuldeep is bowling the final over?",1
I need a hug,1
Just tuned in. Is the umpire man or woman? Hard to predict with the hair.,-7
"if this was the epl and var, it would be overruled just for the hell of it.",4
Umpire looks like the school bus driver from Simpsons,6
Virgin Samad vs Chad Lockie,4
That is horrible close,2
Lol does dk just talk to all bowlers in tamil? Regardless of whether they understand,7
"Holy fuck, the umpire is a man???",-7
No. 69 with that nice catch.,-1
Rashid plays pace better so Russel is riskier option imo.,0
Swann taking the piss lol,3
I wanna shoot myself in the foot,1
"Why do I sometimes see batsmen just chipping it in the air and getting out on the boundary, why not take a harder swing",2
Imagine Gill dropping that relay from Ferguson,5
that heartbeat sound makes me anxious even though I'm a neutral in this match,0
Umpire is saucy ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞),2
RCB the last standing South Indian team. Who would've thought,6
Hes deffo not touched it you can see the space,4
Swann taking the piss of the third umpire is hilarious.,2
The shoelace touched the boundary rope,5
Fucking hell this has been a long match,11
He‚Äôs not touching,2
Can't they zoom in on the shoes lol,4
Write Rashid down for 2 sixes,3
"Lockie Fergugod haha, ^never ^drop ^him ^again ^pls",7
IMHO they should make the 2 person catch not out..,-7
Pandey with that 11cr has been the biggest fraud,1
I think Scotty wants to blow Shubham,4
They should put next SRH batsman‚Äôs mask on Axar‚Äôs face and send him in,1
I hope Russel can bowl,1
"Idk why I support this joke of a team known as SRH. No way they don‚Äôt finish last at this point. Even their overseas players aren‚Äôt performing. Warner looks terrible, and the middle order is an absolute joke",2
"**18.6** Shivam Mavi to Abdul Samad, OUT, **a relay catch at deep midwicket!** Oh this is a leg stump full toss and Samad doesn't get a clean swing out at it. The soft signal is out. He reached out a touch and just flicked this in the end. Lockie covered the ground to his left, caught it, and then put in a backhand flick to long-on. They're checking it upstairs. His right boot, on the balancing step, comes very very close to the boundary padding. He is confident about it. And this should remain out given there's no way to conclusively say the foot touched the padding. There's hardly a ripple there. And yes, it does stay out. Samad will be disappointed he couldn't get that away **146-6**

Abdul Samad c Shubman Gill b Shivam Mavi 23 (15b 2x4 1x6) SR: 153.33",1
Anchors taking it deep is either very successful or very harmful no middle ground,1
Difference between Warner and ABd,1
Warner can‚Äôt hit 6s can he,1
This umpire has a lot of self confidence,3
Need another Rashid masterclass against KKR.,2
"If KKR wins, Lockie should be man of the match",6
Well played Samad,2
YRKFA,2
Wtf not Russell,2
FUCK. It is almost 4 hours. I hope they don't cut the feed to switch to the next match! They have a tendency to do it during streaming.,2
Lockie singlehandedly winning us the game,2
Good over by Mavi all things considered,1
Super duper wide by Dre Russ,3
What's with that run up!,2
Wtf is happening,2
Bruh what,2
But his shoelaces touched the boundary rope /s,1
lol Russell,3
"Ferguson has single handedly derailed SRH chase after that amazing start

3 for 15 n this amazing catch

What an addition he has been",2
They need to pull off an Axar patel now,1
In comes Rashid khan to finish off things....,1
Wtf...why would Russell bowl like that??? Hahahahaha,4
"The thing I don't get about the umpire's hair. Like - surely there's only so many umpires in the tournament, so where's the guy been hiding at till now. Have I just not seen him somehow? Is he brand new? Was it always in a hat or something until now? Is he not actually an umpire but just a random dude who walked into the wrong room and suddenly found himself umpiring an IPL match? Is he actually one of the other umpires wearing a wig and some makeup to hide from those that wish him dead?",1
Rashid gonna smack it,1
Wtf was that run-up????,3
That would've been four at Sharjah,1
Man... Sad to see Russel like this.,2
Lockie MOTM. Irrespective of the result.,2
Really would be interesting to see how SRH' batsmen did on Sharjah. They've only played one match there so far,2
Russell is just walking,6
Wtf Russell,3
Why not Kuldeep?,1
Bruh,2
Andre Russell will bottle this,5
Hookah Bar playing before final over,1
They should give 2 runs for that wide,5
Russell major uncle-in-the-park vibes this season,1
Okay I am done with this match.,1
Jesus man this is taking so long,3
What kind of bowling is this?,1
Dhawan and Axar did this yesterday,1
"Wait, why the fuck would you give the ball to an injured Rus?",1
The long haired umpire was also the first to wear a helmet. Has a temper problem. Was involved in an ugly spat with Gill in a first class match in January 2020.,3
"Russell bowling like he has already given up 
 
Why not give it to mavi?",2
Don't fuck it up Russell,2
Fml,1
Bruh,2
"Very irresponsible of KKR to bowl an injured bowler

Mitch Marsh esque",2
No ball!,3
LMAO WHAT A CLUSTERFUCK,8
Shit captaincy,2
lol!!,2
This umpire definitely spends his time off smoking Charas and listening to Led Zeppelin LPs,8
Fuck brain dead. Fuck this,7
wtf,2
Warner has played a disastrous innings and been very bad this ipl,1
Think Lockie has definitely secured his place for the next 2 games at the very least,2
They are seriously getting him to bowl in this state? Can barely jog smh,6
NO BALL,2
That run up was even more causal than pollard's,7
Lol,2
Wide and no ball. That's a big no ball,3
That siren is terrifying,6
Swann going berserk,3
"I applaud all the captains' commitment to the longest form of the game. With their over rates, they're determined to stretch a 40 over game to 5 days.",3
No ball alarm is so Intimidating!!,8
No ball and a wide ball,5
Lmao,1
That was a pretty good shot for a Yorker tho,4
"Fuck off, Russell",3
What a clownfiesta lol.,2
How do u bowl a no ball with 2 step run up üòÇ,5
"Bowl the same way to Warner


I dare you,I double dare you",2
Google is faster than Cricinfo.,5
Russell single handedly lost us this game,5
Imagine if Gill dropped that lollipop,1
You trust an injured Dre over Kulya. The fuck is wrong with KKR.,1
Dre Russ what are you doing mate,3
the fielder didn't move lol. talk about precision!,1
F,1
I don't like Russel's attitude at all.,2
Oh dre russ oh dear,1
You don't bowl a no ball with that run up.,4
Russel is the imposter ffs.,3
Man. Im placing my bets more on rashid than Warnie!,1
Cant even hit free hit.,1
LMFAO WTF. He looks my Lebanese friend bowling for a few pringles,4
Definitely time to send Dre Russ to the glue factory,2
You know the buffalo wild wings nfl ad. Feels like someone has pulled a lever to make this game interesting.,1
What an incredible ball lmao,1
Do extras stack,4
That should count as two no balls from dre Russ,7
Fixed? You can't be bowling such big no balls in the last over,0
KKR has some team spirit now.,5

"If Axar Patel can, why not Rashid",4
That's the stupidest shit I ever saw from KKR.,8
Why is Kane pissed but,3
Me getting killed by this fucking siren has more probability than getting killed by a gunshot,9
"The amount of people saying Bravo should have done this in the last game. LMAO!

I mean seriously, you guys don't know what he was going through. It's absolutely unfair to ask something like that of anyone.",12
Mohammed amir style no ball,2
What happened to Russel ? His runup looks weak.,3
Give me a SUPEROVER please,3
What the fuck is happening right now?,3
It‚Äôs 11 needed off 4,2
WTF man. Why ball Russell in this state,10
KKR should be freaking ruled out of the tournament. This is fucking illegal wtf,10
Why the fuck Dre bowling? He's ducking injured,15
"Is this a fucking joke, what an insult to kuldeep",8
Just started watching did Warner not open?,2
Pavel Florin had a better run up than this.,4
Bowling russel was a huge mistake,2
At least Kuldeep could have bowled a decent over,0
This is absolutely stupid,2
Oh brother this guy stinks.,2
What a joke lmao,2
He's clearly injured. Shouldn't have bowled him.,6
Warner has woken up.,3
I'm still terrified we're gonna bottle this,7
Imagine having a hamstrung bowler bowl the 20th.,6
bravo ain't taking shitty bowl-with-a-hammy orders from dhoni ;),3
It is 7 off 3,-1
Poor russell,3
Fuck this is close as,4
I have a bad feeling Warner might get out here,2
He‚Äôs bowling without a run up,2
 WC winning captain doesn't deserve this shit.,0
The players need a union to protect them from injuries. This is madness from both the sides.,3
That catch... oof so close for SRH,8
Russell needs a zimmer frame to get to the crease,2
Russel is struggling to bowl,0
Lol this has to be match fixing right,4
Game over.,0
McCullum is the one calling the shots,1
Investigate Morgan's captaincy here.,5
Dre Russ with the run up of a 6th grader that had 16 pints the night before,4
WTF is this a joke,2
Ma chuda behenchod,1
Russel just went from being KKR's best asset to their absolute worst.,3
"What a shambles from Morgan, why allow this",2
Watch Warnie roar after winning this.,4
What lollies is he bowling. Bc,2
Looks like Morgan watched yesterday's CSK match,1
Russel's bowling has evolved like Munaf Patel's over time,3
Why can‚Äôt players hit like this earlier. Why wait for last over,-1
Teams playing injured players just to extract everything from them- Stop it. Stop it. They are already injured,2
Why the F make him ball if he's injured!,3
"Even Kuldeep would have done better than this! WTF is this.
Just say no, if you can't bowl.",3
Utterly terrible bowling.,3
SUPER OVER PLEASE,4
"Eoin Morgan world cup winning captain, lmfao",4
TIL a wide no ball does not give you two extras.,6
Bazza is pissed,2
no way an injured Russell is better than Mavi right,6
Braindead from Morgan,3
Stupid brain dead management.,5
Just fall down and say your hammy's gone.,5
Baby over for Russell?,4
Lmao who thought bjowling Russel would be better than mavi. KKR think tank dumb as fuck,4
Jesus if SRH pull this off Russel is gonna get dropped,6
It was all good until the 19th over....,4
This is like in gully cricket when you throw a very slow ball to try and get him out,3
BABY OVER,2
"Morgan fucked up with bowling Ferguson earlier. It should have been 18th mavi, 19th Ferguson and 20th mavi.",5
8 off 3 off a one-legged struggler. ez for warner?,4
Russell's wants out,1

"At least MSD cared enough about Bravo to not force him to do this only for a match. It‚Äôs only a game, guys",12
I have a bad feeling Warner might get out here x2,1
"Fucking hell KKR what the fuck are you doing? Are you looking at that man,?",13
Bowl a bouncer already,2
This is pretty sad tbh.,7
If Russel never bowled when he was injured his last over would have been 4 years ago,6
This game took 4 hours. Holy shiet,6
This is embarrassing for Morgan now. He should've trusted Kuldeep to finish the task.,9
Andre looks like he has covid,1
Yha slow nahi chalta russell tera mini over,3
Why is Russel bowling cute little medium paces i don't get it?,4
"SRH theme song every time a boundary is hit be like, Go Go Go Go.... Darren Sammi /s",7
The amount of shit Karthik got last year on not giving Russell more time when no one is asking to drop Russell when he is so out of form this year is really hypocritical,12
dk wants captaincy back,1
Russell looks like an American trying out cricket for the first time,8
Can't make this shit up,3
shit bowling,2
Why are they using cameras worse than my 3 yr old mobile??,4

No excitement from the commentators wtf?,2
"Unfortunate really, KKR had the game ez",3
Super over ???,2
wow fuck this shit. Thrown away on a platter.,3
"Well, SRH did the same to Mmarsh in the first match. Looks like this will be the last match for Russel in this IPL.",1
There is no fixing here. Its just a stupid decision by a captain giving the ball to a clearly injured bowler.,2
"Star should have informed 8 nai 7:30 to team playing morning match too.

I paid for two matches , want refund /s",2
"2 balls 4  , this team gonna give me heartattack at 26",1
Wtf is this field man,4
What an absolute chut move this was...like wtf is going on here. It's crazy bad.,3
We gave away that match shitty decision making,4
DK captain would never,1
Ah yes an injured man bowling in death,3
Russell doesn't wanna bowl,1
Talk about a gift tho,2
All these 3 boundaries were field misplacement,2
Did Morgan Sniff glue today?,2
Andre Russell that's it that's the joke,2
Thanks KKR for keeping the top4 race alive,3
Russel just bowl spin now lad,4
Russell is the new Unadkut,3
Morgan definitely shat the bed with bowler selections. Rashid at the end of that Australia game and Russell at the end of this one.,4
Warner‚Äôs not even doing what Axar did yesterday. He‚Äôs just hitting fours,2
We didn't deserve to win anyway.,9
Who is responsible for forcing Dre Russ to bowl? Shame on that cunt,5
Ah yes an injured man bowling in death,2
Russell is overrated!,0
This is too funny,2
Dre-Lund,5
Traaaaaaaaash,1
Russell is today's Unadkat,-1
So whose gonna get fined today ? Srh or kkr .,2
Dude I hate conspiracy theories but looks like russel just completely threw this game. This is the worst over I‚Äôve seen,6
I have bowled with a stretched hammy. Not a good experience. Stupid call.,3
What a disaster for KKR !,5
Commentators seem weirdly unexcited.. Wth..,4
Sorry. Fucking remove Morgan right fucking now. I don't care if Rinku Singh is the captain but this is fucking shambolic.,0
Warner dude what are you doing. You were supposed to struggle bad and look like a fool with a douche moustache there.,2
Well run,1
Bruh I'm so sick of hearing that song,1
"People asking why Russ and Mavi

Kuldeep would have been taken to cleaners as well",3
Wth... Bloody farce,3
Lol.... Super over anyone?,3
omg SRH please win,3
If it goes to super over I might lose my shit,2
So who's third in the list to take over KKR captaincy?,4
Give DK back the captaincy,2
Danny Morrison is commentating like this is a test match with KKR having a 500 run lead,4
"Super over now?

It is indeed :)",2
This is karma for CSK and KXIP match,1
What a genius move it turned out from Rashid to take a single and give strike to Warner lmao,2
Just 1 please,1
DK should come at stumps now,3
(‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª,2
Can't wait for a superover,3
"What a joke of a team lmao

And some lads say KKR gonna finish in the top 2",0
Should have been Kuldeep,2
Bastard Russell getting a taste of his own medicine,2
What an absolute farce this is. Like holy shit I can't believe it.,5
Where is the bouncer,1
FUCK DON'T BE A SUPER OVER,1
I never knew Morgan can be this shit,1
"This is so painful watching Russell bowl like that, fuck off KKR",1
DK and Morgan both make these werird decisions.,1
Is he gonna go for the win or the tie?,1
Superover please,3
Komedi Komedi,5
IS THIS THE CAPTAIN YOU WANTED KKR?,7
I am so nervous,1
I can't take a super over.,1
Srh would do terrible in a super over,3
INB4 Superover fucks the broadcast with the next match,3
This is lowkey so disrespectful to kuldeep,4
That's a shocking decision by Morgan,2
Only Harsha would be happy for us,2
Two of KKR's frontline bowlers didn't finish their quota,2
Super over? We'll miss 3 overs of the MI KXIP game,3
Warner is looking totally out of touch.,2
I cannot believe my eyes,1
We need another no ball,2
4+ hour game. Add a superover also.,2
"For the love of god, don't fucking bottle this",2
Morgan didn't go for Kuldeep after what happened in the final ENG vs AUS ODI where he bowled Rashid and Starc subsequently cunted him,7
[deleted],1
"What will this be, the third game in a row where the fielding side have thrown away a win with poor bowling at the death?",5
Really need an answer from Morgan or Russell on letting Russell bowl the last over. It's painful.,5
give me a superover,3
We don‚Äôt have anyone to bowl a good super over.,6
"What is this, a benefit  match?",6
DK > Morgan,1
Oh god don't go to a super over please,2
Madness,3
Why,3
Lmaoooo,2
Wtf,1
"BC I want to watch the MI match, dont make it a super pls.",2
-_-,2
Super over ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£,1
Would be classic Morgz to cause a super over through his captaincy,6
"What's up with strange captaincy decisions in the death overs? First it was Kohli, then Smith, then MSD, now Morgan...",2
Super over üòÇü§£,5
SUPER OVER!!!!!!,1
Hindsight experts always want captain's head on spike,1
SUPER OVER BABY,4
Wait did they miss a delivery?? They missed the no ball on the second ball of the over,0
Thx for the entertainment russ man,3
Not Aggain...,3
We lost that shot ffs,3
**super over lmao**,3
Holy shittt,2
Third super over of the tournament are you kidding me,8
Lmao,2
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!,3
you can't make this shit up,2
Dead,2
Has Warner forgot to bat.,4
LMAO,1
SUPER OVER!!,1
Okay what match do we get to see now?,2
S U P E R O V E R,1
My heart can't take a super ower from here. Kill me.,5
MI vs Kxip : Are we joke to you,7
LMAOOOO,2
THREW THE GAME,1
[deleted],10
Wtf Rashid didn't even try running the second.,3
I want to see a Super Over just to see how they would manage to squeeze another match tonight,3
SUPEROVERPLSSS,1
"Well no shit Russell's bowling is awful, he's obviously injured. This is a failure of captaincy more than anything",9
RUSSELL MY MAN. FUCK THE HATERS WHO CALL HIM OVERRATED. AN INJURED MAN DID WELL THAN MOST FIT PEOPLE DO.,7
Russel to bowl the super over as well. Mitch Marsh and Bhuvi will walk out  to play him,7
lol im dead,3
Wtf they should have appealed. It would be dead and they win?,8
Why didn't they review it?,2
Warner couldn't hit that limp bowler for 2,7
Bruh,2
Man some dude predicted the super over because both SRH and KKR were involved in super overs before.,6
So who's gonna bat for KKR? Don't say russell,4
Superover lets gooo,3
I refuse to believe that Kuldeep Yadav is a worse bowler than Russell in this state,3
Man I feel so guilty watching this,3
Bottling by KKR,3
Super over?,3
This feels a little scripted ngl,10
Rofl.,2
Why don't they just run? What are they gonna lose? Could just hope for a misfield.,7
How did that end up being a super over. On a super Sunday!! The writers never dissapoint us  do they?,6
Second super over of IPL 2020? Did I miss any?,1
This year‚Äôs IPL has been appropriately ridiculous for 2020,2
Any intent from Pandey or Shanker would have won us the game,2
Lol that was the most less intense finish going to a superover ever,3
Nice script.,3
"Br√ºh no matter the result, that was a fucking sensible innings from Warner",2
I'll still say that Russell fucked it up,1
what a shame. peak warner would have smashed those pies to the desert!,3
This is Brain dead Management,3
Fuuuuuuuck. This match has gone on long enough already,4
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA,1
Bottle job from KKR,1
The tournament is still ALIVE. Good to see the glass body being treated like glass and not diamond.,1
Fuckin hell superover. Warner should be chasing this,1
Woooooo super over,1
I swear if KKR win the super over. I fucking swear,2
Ok who's nudes does russell have?,3
Rashid has to run there wtf,6
"Wtf warner, can't hit lollipops now?",0
Fluffed it,1
Nice to know that I would only give 16 runs away bowling to Warner.,3
"Wait, first ball was a noball and a wide. But only one run was given. Is that a rule?",2
Why not appeal for LBW,4
Bowl russel in super over too /s,8
Oh god 3 super overs this season.,8
LMAOOO here we go again lads,6
"You're being listened to whether you want it or not. Is that unsettling, or reassuring?",1
That ball was there to be hit damn,1
"We dont have a bowler and they have ferguson , we lost :(",5
frickk,2
Ferguson plz,2
JB/Warner/Samad for batting? Lockie will bowl for them surely,2
Eoin vs Kane ends up in a super over. Surely the first time it has ever happened.,13
Son of ****** botteled a fricking match. Now open Russel for Super over Komedians.,3
Most boring match to go to a super over?,4
Will Karthik haters crucify Morgan now? World's best captain ‚Ñ¢,4
"Morgan v Kane in a Super Over, flashbacks making me hard",15
This is a shitty result.,3
Why the fuck Rashid didn't run the 2nd?,7
What happens with other match?,2
This is going to fuel so many dumb fixing theories lmao,5
Ben Stokes,3
[deleted],0
KKR will win this unless Kanos destroys Ferguson,6
"So Rashid is retarded? Got it.

Edit: because he didn‚Äôt even try running 2nd and stopped Warner.",0
Ipl script writers never disappoints. üëç,2
"KKR did everything to try to lose. 

SRH didn‚Äôt want any of it!",5
Everything is fixed? /s,3
Ferguson over cummins for super over,2
Both teams doing their absolute best to clutch defeat from the jaws of victory,5
Andre to continue bowling in the super over.,3
Morgan can twirl his mustache now!!,3
Great. Now I'm gonna miss Rohit's 12-ball 50 because of the super-over.,6
"Lmao.. what a match.. both teams doing their best to make it entertaining.. I love super overs..

Also, bowling Russell was the dumbest decision I have ever seen a captain make.. even Kohli does better.",6
LOL SUPER OVER AHAHHAHAHAAHA LETS GOOOOOO,0
Wow that some listless commentary from Danny Morrison. This was such a thriller and he was just droning on,4
"""Kolkata have done their best to throw this game away"" Factual statements have never been said before.",6
Let's not let this Super Over distract us from the fact that the KKR on-field leadership decided to have a hamstrung bowler bowl the 20th over. That was shambolic.,7
Why didn't they attempt the 2nd,2
Worst mistake to make Russel bowl last over.,3
surely the direction to force dre russ back on the field is someone up higher and not Morgan. Disgraceful to put him back on the field,3
Kanos time ?,2
"Warner doesn't seem to be able to hit cleanly, like before. What happened to him? Lack of match fitness?",2
Russell isn‚Äôt going to bat for sure,2
"Lockie should bowl, Samad and Warner to bat possibly",7
SRH surely have the weakest super over team,8
[removed],3
"If he would given it Kuldeep , you all would have trolled him like Dhoni when he give it to Jadeja. 

You all unreasonable.",11
KKR is going to send Russ to bat aren't they?,2
Bruh another match has started,3
Dhenier Warner.,2
Warner looks hopelessly out of touch but he has somehow taken it to the super over,4
"I am pretty sure if Rashid Khan was on strike in the last over, SRH would have won it easily.",-1
Lmao I'm pretty sure this season has the most number of super overs.,2
You can't miss 2 from 1. Fuck,3
Iol Morgan and Williamson on the two ends of a superover. Where have we seen this before?,11
"Warner got SRH this far and then did a KLPD. 

Should have just whacked it like Pooran did the other day.
And like he had been hitting this entire over for boundaries.",3
Super Over to keep the tournament competitive. What drama,2
"Who bats for SRH Samad and Bairstow? 

KKR- Morgan and Russell?",1
Morgan will choose russel to bowl the super over,2
Rashid got this in the bag. SRH need to give him 10 runs to play with,1
Gotta be Lockie to bowl,3
"SRH: Rashid Khan bowls, and Warner, Bairstow and Rashid to bat

KKR: Lockie Ferguson bowls, and Dinesh Karthik, Andre Russell (if fit, otherwise maybe Morgan) and Pat Cummins to bat",1
"Russell has almost costed KKR this game. The most depressing attitude throughout the over. Injured? Say NO, I can't bowl.",1
Guys who bowls super over? Natrajan or Rashid?,1
Morgz attracts super overs like a magnet,3
Scenes if Russell bowls and bats in the super over.,7
"I swear if Cummins bowls this over, I'll kill Morgan",2
Rashid or Natarajan?,1
You watch Mumbai play and its like a completely different sport to both these teams.,2
Why is the announcer explaining the rules to pro players ?,2
Morgan might let rRussell bowl or bat in the super over,1
"If Lockie doesn't bowl the superover, KKR fans should ask for the sack of Morgan",4
Ok now I can't watch the other match because the stream is still showing me the super over.  ü§î,1
"Warner, Bairstow, Samad for SRH - Natarajan

Morgan, DK, Russel - Russel/ Lockie",1
I say send Abdul samad and BAIRSTOW for super over,3
"KKR is gonna win this. DK, Morgan for batting and Lockie for bowling",4
We have morgan guys!!!...,2
"Can we make this a combined match thread here?

Wanna discuss MI KXIP. Rohit hit a 4",1
Gonna get downvoted but anyone else feel this match kinda fixed. Idk just seems fishy and the commentators aren‚Äôt hyped at all,3
BC how to open two tabs in HOTSTAR to watch both!!!,1
"Russell injury in the field hit us hard

No way he wud be conceding 17 the way he was bowling in prev games

Just hoping Ferguson does the job for us again",1
"I‚Äôm no expert but it takes two to tango. Russel was brought back on the field 4 overs ago, it was always going to be him bowling in the end and the entire management knew this. The only one who could‚Äôve said no was him",3
Rashid Khan to bowl for SRH and Lockie Ferguson to bowl for KKR. Let's goo!!,2
"I think Bairstow and Samad tbh, Warner not clearing the boundary at all",2
KKR will go with Ferguson,2
"100D underwater backgammon from Morgan (who's won every super over he's captained) for letting the game get to this stage, knowing full well that Williamson is on the other team.",16
Someone is KKR coaching staff going to Morgan saying we should give the super over bowling to Russell,2
"To all the people saying Russell is injured, can't he just have refused to bowl other than bowling these half hearted stuff.

I just hope he doesn't bat in the superover.",5
Wait wasn't that a wide and a noball? Is that just 1 run?,2
Captain DK should have known Russell is injured and kept Ferguson for the depth. What a horrible captaincy,-2
Morgan & Warner : Fuck!!,5
50 year old Wasim akram bowled faster than that in the All stars matches.,3
KKR is gonna winüëå,3
Wtf is up with Russell? Why is he bowling like this,10
This had the same vibes as that rpsg vs mi final,2
They should declare an intentional two person catch illegal because its not a real catch.,-3
Gawddd I am tired,2
"Who would bat for kkr in super over? Gill is kill, rana is dodgy, Russell is no go. Morgan, Tripathi and dk looks good but don't think they can take on rashid.",1
Superover with Eng and NZ captains once again against each other,8
Both teams performed like shit today tbh,8
Morgan should bowl Russell in the super over,5
Deadest match to be a super over,9
That looked like an LBW btw,3
So mi vs kxip is delayed right?,2
It‚Äôs Ipl in uae that basically translates to bookies paradise,3
"Holy fuck, that looked close. Why didn't they appeal",6
[deleted],2
Kkr have Ferguson on form so they definitely have the advantage,4
So just like MS in middle of decade both Kohli and Warner have slowed down. Makes ABD look even more impressive.,3
They have Lockie we have shit,4
We haven't won one Super over ‡ºé‡∫∂‚Äø‡ºé‡∫∂,5
There was a small chance if them getting back tbh,1
"is KKR going to give **Ferguson the super over**

Kiwis and super overs don't go well",6
We have no one that can bowl in a super over,5
"A match went to super over and the commentary was so boring, as if this happens everyday",3
Watch Ferguson get absolutely rekt in super over lol,6
Lockie's gonna fuck SRH up,3
This has to be the calmest super over yet,7
"We're lucky it's going into a Super Over. 

Pak pls ffs let's fix our relations with India. I want to see Shaheen bullying these bullies and Babe Azam coming in after Banton. 

Also will greatly help the shitty bowing in this tournament. You won't need to bowl as many domestic Unadkats and give the last over to a 7 crore unfit fragile piece of Compound V glass who bowls like an American trying to keeping his arm straighter than the statue of liberty.",8
Lockie surely bowling it! Right??????,2
"Why the hell didn't they review that, it wasn't far off.",3
This would be SRH win if Ferguson wasn't going to be bowling the super over rofl.,2
Lmaoo poor mi and kxip fans,3
[deleted],2
Is that a LBW?,3
"Cool, he gave it to Ferguson. It's what Kane should've done in the WC final.",5
Thank fuck Fergie time,2
"I don't know if it was Russell being injured, but that was the least exciting climax to a tied match I've ever seen",4
"Why didn‚Äôt they go for the second run? Sure it was gonna be a run out 99.9% of the time, but there was no reason not to go for it",4
We have no consistent big hitters and we are are going to lose terribly in the super over,4
Russell is in terrible form. Hope they don't send him in.,3
"**Third Super Over of IPL2020**

DC v KXIP in Dubai

"What happens to the MI match now, will it be delayed???",2
Nice,5
"Lockie should bowl for KKR.

Rashid for SRH?",3
Guys I was told KKR would have a 100% win ran rate now that they're captained by the world's greatest captain to ever exist. What happened?,5
The bottom 5 teams: Win? Why would we want to win? Winning is overrated,11
I always think what would have hapoen if lockie bowled the super over in 2019,5
Warner bairstow and samad,1
"Cracking match this!

Bairstow to join Warner perhaps?",2
"Williamson v Morgan in a Super Over.

Can't make this shit up",13
"They definitely had more in the tank to try a desperate second run at the end, even if it meant a run out",1
"Surely Samad, Warner & Kane should bat for SRH?",1
Super Over! Bad mistake from Morgan to bowl out Ferguson and hand the 19th to Mavi.,2
FFS not BASIL THAMBI!!,2
"Rana and Karthik should take strike, IMO.",1
That not out ?,1
Bairstow Warner and Rashid Khan is what I'd go with.,2
Gald we are continuing to see this match instead of the dead rubber,2
Russel to bat and bowl the super over,6
"Unless Russell convinced everyone he was ok there is no justification for bowling Ferguson the 18th, disallowing 2 from Mavi",2
"Don‚Äôt put this on Russell, he was clearly pressured to return back and bowl.",5
Ok I remember this shit happened before. Fluffy of boundaries and single for final ball. But I don't remember the teams,3
It's easy to this all in retrospect now but he had to give it to Russell. We saw what happened to Jadeja yesterday. Spinners are always more risky,5
Star India's broadcast schedule getting fucked today,7
Morrison forgot to snort his daily dose of coke before this game.,6
KKR have lost all 3 Superovers they played in,2
Who's gonna bat for us? I have no fucking clue,2
If DK was captain he would be getting death threats rn.,8
Russell was pretty much gifting the ball to score. If any other player was on strike who had faced 20 something deliveries he would have score 20+ score easily in this over. Very poor from Warner.,2
Super over is just a delayed win for KKR is all,3
Literally every KKR and SRH fan right now:This shit is out of syllabusüò≥üòÇüëçüèΩ,6
They finally picked Ferguson,1
Bring in Shankar to bat,1
Where can I watch the MI match? It's already started,1
DJ playing seductive songs in the stadium to bring Loki into the mood,4
Why didn't they appeal for lbw? Was there an edge?,3

It is four hours already and there is going to be a super over too. Broadcasters must be furious. On the day of double header too. Hopefully this will change something. Has to.,2
Morgan dropped the ball there. Poor decision to have him bowl the last over,2
Muralis belly looking pretty good.  These guys must be smashing the hotel buffet on the reg,8
2 super overs. You heard it here first.,4
Not a Kiwi for a superover. Just bowl Cummins.,8
Why didn't they appeal for an LBW on the final delivery?,2
Fuck off super overs,4
Not even an appeal!!,4
"Morgan on KKR's Side and Kane on SRH's side.




Fuck.",10
KKR to break their super over duck,5
Why did Davey stop Rashid from trying for the double!,3
Why didn't Rashid Khan try running the second run? That was a poor decision. They could have won without the super over if they tried.,3
Expected more enthusiasm from Danny Morrison tbh,5
[deleted],2
Look at this howard stern motherfucker,0
This is the shit why people say IPL is fixed,15
warner should NOT open lol.  he was struggling throughout his innings,5
"Morgan, DK and Cummins for KKR?",5
"If anyone is confused about broadcast (SD channels):

Star Sports 1 & 2 - MI vs KXIP

Star Gold - KKR vs SRH",0
Wtf . why not KW. This is so dumb,0
"This is brain freeze of all brain freezes. 1st KKR opted to give a last over to injured Russel instead of Kuldip, then on the last ball batsmen decided not to take the risk for 2nd run to win the match, what is there to lose and hope for an overthrow or something. SMH.",6
Worst over I‚Äôve ever seen in my life oh my god,1
KKR better send out Shahrukh Khan for it. 36 runs confirmed if so.,4
DK Morgan and Tripathi for KKR? Who opens? Tripathi and Morgan?,1
"If it were any other captain, he‚Äôd be crucified here for the decision to give Russel that last over",2
Ya Warner and bairstow is the right choice,1
He needs to bowl Russ in the super over,3
"Whoever the commentator on sky is, is fucking shambolic and sounds like he‚Äôs ready for bed",3
Morgan is rated super highly and rightfully so but what the hell was the decision to bowl Dre in the last over? hes injured and kuldeep has 1 left to bowl? does Warner have Kuldeeps number or something??? cant have been much worse than what Russell just produced no?,5
KKR has never won a super over in IPL so far,4
Ffs why not Samad,3
Morgan should be fined for slow over rate.,3
"Guys, which match should I watch?",3
Just realised Russell can't bat lmao,2
no bolwer for srh..,2
I know he's Lockie Ferguson but at the end of the day he's a Kiwi,3
"I suspect neither team is that excited about the tie because they've both got away with fairly sub-par performances, the last over was just SRH's mediocre batting vs. KKR's bizarre tactics",1
Morgan and Williamson : *hey I've seen this one before!*,6
Warner Bairstow need to go bang bang here,3
Morgan the glass holder,2
Today was the perfect opportunity to take advantage of review system. Kkr fucked up.,3
Why is simon pegg walking out?,3
Bairstow should have come in,1
"Dread it, run from it, Bairstow and Warner opening for srh is inevitable.",7
How old is Warner? Feels like we're never gonna see peak Warner again(I know he almost won them this game but still this is no peak Warner),3
Should've run two,2
"Super over. Morgan on one side, Kane on the other, we know who wins.",9
"The first was also a wide, apart from noball. Why didn't they give it?",1
I hope for Kane's sanity that he doesn't lose another super over to Morgan,3
Shouldn't Rashid have run on the last ball??Who knows it would've been an overthrow??What did he have to lose (apart from his wicket ofc),1
What would have happened if KKR had reviewed that last ball for LBW?,2
Let YJB take strike,1
"When choker meets choker then this is what happens, super over!",1
Wasn't the past delivery out? Why didn't they appeal or take DRS?,1
Long haired umpire should know that the long hair needs to be complemented by a bit of muscle on the arms.,3
"Such an obvious noball/wide first off. Then that single off the last ball! 

Who's writing these scripts! Same guy who writes the cliched bollywood movies??",2
Williamson suffering from PTSD rn,2
So 6 teams have been involved in a Super Over this season?,2
"Morgan and Ferguson, and Kane and bairstow know it, oh wait..",2
Warner should have not come. Huge blundered. I can't believe I am saying this but I have watched him bat in this match. His batting looks out of touch.,2
Captain Morgan & super overs - name a better duo :),2
"Bairstow going to hammer Ferguson all over the park

Warner is going to sledge him 'Remember the WC'

Kane is going to be upset again",3
Looked as if warner didn't want to hit two there.,2
Lol he wiped his forehead sweat with the ball,1
"3rd Super Over of the season, what's the highest in a season?",3
It will be really hard to score too many against Ferguson,2
Danny Morrison was lifeless during the final over,1
"Why give the last over to fuckin insured Russel?

Russel's run up was so casual that he put even Pollard to shame.",1
"Just wanna say that even as a neutral, my heart is absolutely racing

This is great stuff",4
"Ok so if im using a ~~legal~~ stream, i cant watch MI i guess? untill this game is over",2
ATTENTION BROHIT IS PLAYING THE OTHER GAME,1
Oh god it's Lockie. Bairstow's gonna get bowled,3
Is Kanos injured ??,3
Twist : Baz is actually writing his autobiography,4
Trash Warner lol.,4
Why was the ending so casual this match!? Is there another commentator present even?,10
Ferguson you madlad,7
Hahahaha fuck off warner,4
Oh shit SRH!,4
Lockie Ferguson! What a start!,6
Lmao wtf,3
First ball gone!,4
"Bc what was that. Fuck,",2
"The main problem for SRH is, who will bowl. Surely not *Baal Bujurg*.",3
Beauty,2
Mustache for the W,6
Lockie gets ‚Äú3 gunaah lagaan‚Äù for this performance,10
Oh fuck,5
Plot Twist -  Rana to bowl  the Super Over,7
Who are SRH gonna bowl? Nattu or Rashid??,2
What a game this man is having,9
Fergie have my babies,7
What shit,5
New Zealand pacer bowling super over under England captain's captaincy...,14
Both the teams kinda deserve to lose,3
Warner look like gets Warner,1
Lockie locked the match i guess,3
Screw this,1
Give this man 10 crores right now!,6
Ferguson has been unplayable,3
Imagine if koach did what Morgan has done today.,4
Got him. Who the fuck is winning this?,2
Lockie U beautyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy,3
Get fucked Warner,1
Man ferguson has been a gold today,3
"No point tuning in other side, MI have already scored like 10 runs on the first over lol.",3
How good has Fergie been today holy shit!,8
Rip srh. Ferguson can do no wrong today,7
WOW.,2
Game over. Tournament over.,5
eggheads managing both teams today,7
Jesus christ,1
Wtf was that shot Warner lmao,4
"Fuck yeah, Lockie!",2
YESSSSS. LOCKIE YOU BEAUTY!!,0
Lmao Warner,2
Just like watching Broad again.,3
Lockie is amazing,3
Rofl,2
This is over big time. We hit can't shit of Lockie.,6
Lockieeeee is a REVALATION,4
Wtf was warner trying to do?,2
The graphics for super over is sick. Looks like a graphic card,5
Me switching both Star Sports channels to catch up both games,1
Lockie having one hell of a game,3
"If anything those lenskart ads prove that fielders can fuck up even simple run out, poor cricket from Rashid",4
Kane dead?,2
Lol,2
Ahahaha ffs Warner,3
Locke take my energy („Å£.‚ùõ ·¥ó ‚ùõ.)„Å£,1
Yes Lockie. You win the battle of the staches,3
Lockie was warming the bench for 9 matches. W.O.W.,7
How much is par for a super over to be enough?,2
Ashish Nehra creaming himself seeing Lockie get wickets from length deliveries,5
Lockie for captain,2
"That's why in super over, you send fresh batsmen only",2
I‚Äôve watched a lot of Warner and that has to be the worst I‚Äôve seen from him reaching 40+... Russell basically gifted the game,2
lol Warner actually thought those boundaries against a half fit Russell made him a better option than Samad,5
What was he trying there,2
[deleted],5
And KKR couldn‚Äôt fit Lockie until now. smh,3
Tell me who paid 15 cr for Cummins and not for Ferguson,5
Well played warner LOL,3
This towns only big enough for one ridiculous moustache,10
"Lol

Lockie gonna wrap this up in the next ball",3
It's painful to see Warner struggle like this.,3
They need atleast 12 for a chance,3
Ferguson for the man of the tournament,4
top of off is literally the dream,3
Williamson about to go 13 Reasons Why on SRH,6
Speed of this first ball?,1
Can someone plz tell me score of MI match? üôèüèΩüôèüèΩ,1
Today's match is SRH vs Ferguson.,2
That‚Äôs like the 82736492726337th time I‚Äôve seen Warner getting bowled in that way.,2
Lockie about to take revenge of all the bad memories of superovers.,4
"Ok Hyd boys, who are we rooting for now that we are out?",2
"Why is this nobody bowling the super over instead of Andrew Russell?

Lol, horse-shit captaincy from Eoin Morgan.",2
Should've been Ferguson bowling the super over in that final.,6
If he gets 2 wickets in the super over is that technically a 5fer?,9
Lol. I predicted this same based on Warner performance in this match. Poor coaching decision.,5
r/deathrattleporn in Super Over makes me so happy.,2
Why was Ferguson on the bench all this time,3
Has got to be Samad if Williamson is injured?,5
"We dead, press f to respect",6
"No ferguson, what about the revenge with morgan?",7
Where have we been hiding lockie???,2
fancy pancy scorecard i like,1
"First match over-extends into the second game            

IPL: *confused screening*",2
LOCKIE FERGUSON YOU BEAUTY,1
"There have been 90 T20 matches that have gone to a Super Over. 

44 won by the team batting first in the Super Over, 46 won by the team batting second in the Super Over. 

*Cricviz*",4
"Ok, Ferguson just too good today",2
Are you even an alpha if you don't have porn stache and bowling wits like lockie?,3
~~Nokia~~,1
Good ball by Lockie but WTF was Warner doing? Leave those shit shots to Uncle Manish.,5
"At this point Ferguson should be arrested,for harrasing an entire team ü§£ü§£",5
That was a lenth delivery from Ferguson...poor shot from Warner...,2
It should‚Äôve been samad and Bairstow. Bairstow should‚Äôve taken strike. What is Warner thinking,5
Uncomfortable Mustache b. Quality Mustache 0(1),4
Who will bowl for srh.,1
Samad over Kane wowwwwww,2
"Warner never looked in touch through the innings, a barely jogging Russell made him look better at the end tbh!",5
Something about Ferguson tells me he should have played in the 1970s 1980s era,6
MI 15/0 in 2 overs,6
McCullum is a fucking moron of a coach. Our entire side feels more shaky than an earthquake in LA,4
Lockies Chad moustache > Warner‚Äôs virgin bum fluff,9
"MoM - Lockie Ferguson 

What a way to make an entrance!",6
Do super overs count towards a players stats?,2
"Samad?? at 0-1!

Man you take a risk and if that goes bad you play safe.

You dont play safe and then take a risk!",3
KKR deserve to lose this tbh. Horrible planning and execution,0
FERGUUUUUUU,5
"Now that I think of it, Russell‚Äôs been limping for like 4 games at this point",4
Stupid fucking idiots,7
LOCKIEEEEE,3
And that‚Äôs the game,2
Ferguson was unplayable today,3
üî•üî•üî•üëä,2
So disappointing,2
Press F to pay respects to mah Bois,5
Fuck,2
YOOOOOOOO,3
Incredible,4
Exact same as the first super over lol,5
Man ferguson is on another level,5
Wow. Won the super over on his own,7
"Jfc, ferguson is insane",4
"WTF was Warner trying? 

Two times in two balls, trying to edge it and nudge it around. 

All the while he was swinging it so beautifully in that final over and now trying cute nudges ffs.",9
That's his fiver,4
"holy fuck Lockie, you madlad",3
holyyyyyy,3
Ferguson where did u come from bruh bloody brilliant,8
LOCKIE FUCKING FERGUSON,10
5 wicket haul for Lockie,4

Fuck this for SRH. KKR 's match now.,2

Fucking hell,3
I'd give the ball to Nattu Kaka.,8
Why would you fucking GIVE HOPE IN THE FIRST PLACE,1
Wtf you slog like that idiot. Should've given strike to Bairstow,4
Game over,3
Bruh,2
Lockie doing what Rashid did to us in 2018.,5
LOCKIE YOU LEGEND,5
"Holy shit Lockie, you god of mischief.",7
"Lockie is on roll today , phenomenal üî•",5
Lockie Ferguson. So many bowled out.,4
Lmfaoo,2

"MY MY OH MY!!!

Warner chokes in a big moment who saw that coming...,2
They didn't play lockie for 8 games..,6
Ferguson GOD!,5
üîí üîí üîí üîê,6
"Samad is an absolutely fucking terrible batsman. Seriously, he missed out so many pies earlier. Please bench him for the rest of the season",2
Lmao,1
Incredible decision by Morgan to bowl Ferguson in the Super Over. Keeps the haters quiet!,1
"Lockie Ferguson u beautyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy, pls be KKR captain, coach,Bowler, Fielder.",7
LOCKIE !! LOCKIE !! LOCKIE !!,1
What a fucking match he has had,3

Sunbottlers Hyderabad,2
FUCKING BEAST MODE,4
Why has Ferguson not played in previous matches wtf,5
Wtf is this guy for a month,3
Motherfucking Lockie Ferguson. Remember the name.,5
bullshit,1
Ferguson is a god,5
Rabada eat your heart out,3
Good night,2
Guess we saw what would have happened if Lockie bowled the super over in WC final,8
English captain entrusting a kiwi to bowl in a super over is peak IPL :D,6
I feel y‚Äôall SRH bros,3
WTF Ferguson has bowl NZ's next super over,1
LOCKIE FERGUSON!!!! REMEMBER THE NAME!!!,7
Pedo-stache guy does it again!,2
"Lmao what a disaster, is that the worst super over ever?",5
Lol SRH have shat the bed here,2
DC MI RCB KKR top 4,2
5 wicket haul for Lockie,6
"I don't understand - why did Rashid not go for the 2nd run? I think Warner was about to go for it but Rashid raised his hand. What was he going to gain by remaining not out? There might be a misfield, an overthrow etc.",6
Hahaha what the fuck is happening,3
"Hyderabad fans, one question, WHY? All this effort for this!",6
Holy fuck,6
Are these wickets counted in the bowler's career tally?,2
Are super over wickets included in the bowler‚Äôs tally?,4
Ferguson !!! What a bowler,5
Narine exit seems to have worked wonders for KKR,2
I'm wondering why Lockie Ferguson was locked away until this game.,5
"Bmac is poor at making strategies , brilliant match by Lockie",3
That's it boys. It's over for Russel and Naraine.,3
GG KKR. Uninstalling hotstar,4
Where was he ??!? why didnt KKR use him earlier?,11
What a game for Lockie,5
Embarrasing,2
Fifer for Lockie... What a match!,7
Lockie is a God jfc,3
Not even YRKFA can defend this lol.,2
Man unbelievable fergi you are gold dude baz is discussing why was he not playing before are we fools,2
"Lockie ""length gendbaaji"" Ferguson.",7
"In hindsight, they should've settled for a single the previous ball...",3
Do these superover wickets count in a purple cap???????,3
"Well that's the top 4 decided then, I guess",3
Ridiculous to not send Williamson,2
"Bowls Wicket to Wicket, gets W 2 W",5
I don't know why Bairstow didn't open the super over,3
Rashid can bowl a maiden?,5
LOCKIE TO BAT LOCKIE TO BAT LOCKIE TO BAT,5
Why on earth would they not send Williamson?,1
"They were right.

Ferguson is God Indeed.",5
The only guy who is in pressure here is pat cummings.,6
Lockie getting the 15 crores next auction for sure.,12
Give the ball to Rashid and insha'Allah,3
Wow,1
KKR LEGEND LOCKIE FERGUSON,9
What was this mustachio doing in the bench for 8 matches? Mustachio>Cumdog,5
Samad is garbage,1
5 wicket haul...but super overs don't count.....why???,8
5 wickets for Fergie today,5
Morgan and DK please.,0
5 wickets in a match still not a fifer only a KIWI can achieve this.,11
Burn SRH.you deserve to loose.,5
Fuck this. Fuck my life.,3
Another anticlimactic as fuck super over. Insane deliveries from Lockie though.,4
Lockie Fergusen literally was unplayable today. He single handedly won this for KKR,5
SRH didn't deserve the victory anyway. Russell basically handed them the super over.,7
Kanos living superover again but he didn't give the bowl to Ferguson,6
Russell was bowling absolute pies. Warner should've been able to finish it.,5
Williamson was their best player and they send a rookie,2
Swann please stop interrupting binga it‚Äôs annoying as hell,5
Wow Lockie.,3
Unbelievably pathetic this from SRH.,4
Imagine doing all that work to take it to a super over and then losing both wickets in  3 balls,5
Goatie Ferguson,3
Fuck it send Lockie out to bat and watch him cunt the first ball for 6,10
If only NZ played Lockie during that super over lmfao,8
Lockie with a fifer in his first match.,3
Double r/deathrattleporn in super over make me [go.](https://tenor.com/view/quagmire-family-guy-giggity-gif-4084933),5

"‚ÄòLock, Stock and Two Smoking Deliveries‚Äô excellent commentary",6
they paid Cummins 17 crore to high 5 Ferguson,8
"**David Warner in Super Overs in IPL**

vs RCB, 2013 - First ball ü¶Ü

vs KKR, 2020 - First ball ü¶Ü",5
Lockie to win purple cap in record number of games?,5
Ferguson got no time to waste,5
I'm gay for the Lochness Monster üëπüòç,5
Morgan - don‚Äôt want to bat now. This is cheating,3
"Lmao 5fer for ferguson

N 4 bowled",5
I FUCKING LOVE YOU LOCKIE,10
Who's bowling for KKR?,6
My mam warnie just tanked the last ball of the match,6
Pan the camera to cummins now,3
poor jonny think you‚Äôve gotta have the englishman facing against the kiwi in a super over lol,7
"Damn as a neutral supporter, feel sorry for SRH. So close yet so far.",3
And to think this guy was benched for 8 games lmao,7
"No kane at the superover? 
Understandable have a great day.",1
Salute to mr. ferguson. Stumps taken out everytime.,2
KKR need to pull a punjab,1
"How amazing would it be if we get a 1/2 

Peak 2020, a man can wish",5
Useless superovers this year apart from the MI v RCB one. 2-2 in two superovers.,6
"On balance I think KKR deserve to win anyway, SRH were never getting close in that run-chase until KKR messed up their bowling options with Russell's injury",8
He is number 69.,4
Surely gill needs to bat here,3
Lockies a proper lad,4
holy fuck what a disaster for srh,6
"The highest pressure situation, do you bring out an 18 year old, or the captain of the New Zealand International team?

Ofc the 18yo",10
Lokie's performance is actually going to get nominated for AVN awards 2020,5
Do these wickets count for total tournament wickets for Lockie?,4
"Lmao what the fuck, such a chutiya super over",1
RIP SRH,1
And you thought he keeps his porn stache just for looks?,6
"Loki ferguson be like : BOOM HEADSHOT, BOOM HEADSHOT",5
Rookie mistake by SRH. You don't play a superover with Williamson in your side; not since THAT match,13
[deleted],2
"This is what kkr needed, a bowler who can bowl Yorkers and attack with pace",3
In before Natarajan 0000WW,5
[deleted],4
Warner should have finished this from 4 off 2,4
Lockie did a Rabada,6
"Dear Unadcunt , this is how you bowl slow Yorkers.",3
Don‚Äôt worry Vijay Shankar got this,4
Give over to Rashid and expect a miracle,7
Fergusen is jersey number 69. Of course.,11
Will that count as a 5-fer? Lol,7
"Lockie MoM, what a performance for the first game in!",3
F,2
"Lockie  man, what a winner",3
Williamson rn: Damn if I used Lockie for the super over we would be world champions by now,6
I'm guessing Natarajan will bowl the over for SRH?,3
So kkr is basically in the playoffs,10
Imagine Narine coming in and bowling  like he used to (now that umpires look silly for reporting him for something that shouldn‚Äôt be he will probably bend the elbow even more) and Ferguson bowling like this. KKR won‚Äôt need batting anymore,7
Feels bad for srh,3
"Idk why they call him Lockie, Lachlan Ferguson is so much cooler.",2
"*Walks onto field*  

*Bowled*    

*Two*

*Bowled*  

*Walks straight off*",6
"Why was it announced as Final batsman?

If more than 1 wicket falls, the 'over' is finished?",3
"De Kock just hit six in the other match, for those with no streams.",7
Bowl Rashid khan here,6
All those people claiming Kane should've batted now would've shitted on the SRH management for letting an injured Kane play...,7
You'd find more IQ at a trump rally. Absolutely embarrassing this from SRH,3
Quick qn does these 2 wicket count in player's record,2
Lockie‚Äôs been bowling slower balls the whole match. Both Warner and Samad should‚Äôve expected it. It‚Äôs more on Warner criminal that you get out first ball of a super over.,6
"Pour one out for Kane, Morgan‚Äôs done him again",10
"Damn. Tuned in just for the super over.

Well that was anti-climatic.",3
"Ferguson is going home to NZ, he doesn't want to ruin IPL auction value

it can only go down",9
Another match of stupid decisions!,2
Abdul Samad ...who the f is this guy ? What a dumbass,-7
That rule is wack. Only get 2 wickets? Fuck that. Use all 6 balls,3
Why did Johnny not took the strike? What the fuck is this?,4
Warner looks dead inside,7
Warner about to cry,9
"Man, Lockie having the game of a lifetime.

Dude's just become an IPL MVP out of nowhere.",17
Entire KKR team to grow moustaches now,12
[deleted],1
Why the fuck is everyone handing free points to KKR?,18
We should have not tried to win in the first place .,4
Morgs DK and cummins for super over i assume,3
Finally a bowler who bowl you miss I hit balls,9
"The right strategy would've been knocking around till the 5th ball and then attacking the last ball. Anyway, we were never in this game(other than the batting PP).",2
Samad over Williamson..  wonder why,4
Ferguson has locked up this game for KKR,5
"Bkl kuch tho sharam karo. 3 in super over, what shit is this. Just get 8th in ipl. Fucking we deserve to lose",0
"Where have you been Lachlan? Where have you been?

Fire all the coaches who thought he should be on bench.

Beast of a bowler.",3
"It‚Äôs ok SRH, it stops hurting after a while",5
Warnie is furiousssss,3
Warner looks dead from inside,3
Inb4 Morgan 6 first ball,2
Inb4 Rashid takes 2 in 2,2
Swanny is gonna take this umpire home tonight,3
Eoin Morgan-king of the super over,2
Compensatory Over!! Who is honna take the blame,1
This match is more about who makes less non sensical decision rather than being most good decisions lol,1
calling it: 4 off the first ball,2
Batted beautifully for Warner. What! He was struggling all game.,2
SRH really pulling a KXIP here outta nowhere,3
"Why the fuck didnt Rashid run that second. On the off chance that kkr fucked up the run out, you SURELY run that",9
Been crying my throat hoarse since the start of the torunament that they should play Lockie in the XI. Glad that our management corrected its ways before it was too late.,3
And Lockie was benched till now.,1
"Lockie is a good man, doesn't want us to miss Mumbai's match.",7
"Macha Ferguson

- bowls at 150 
- deadly looking moustache
- wears 69",12
I think Rashid can pull it off,0
NZ player doing well in Superover ‡≤†_‡≤†,3
Lockie Ferguson - 3 wickets from 4 overs and 2 wickets from 3 balls in Super over. What a pleasure to watch him bowl !!,3
RASHID üòç,1
Scenes if first two ball wickets,3
SRH batting is just horrible. The managements going all in for Manish Pandey has been a disaster!,3
KKR! Can I bat please?,1
Effectively a 5-er for Lockie.,1
"So Ferguson wins the ""porn stache"" derby, right?",5
Release Kane you losers. Can't even utilise him properly,3
Poor Bairstow didn't even get to face a single delivery.,6
"Every time williamson will look at Morgan's face , it will just give him PTSD of all the super overs he's lost against him",5
Will rashid bowl or natrajan?,2
Good slower ball by ferguson,1
"This sucks, good on you Warner.. it was SRH Vs Ferguson today.",2
Fuck it. KKR should send out Lockie to bat too,7
Surprising that the batsmen weren't prepared for slower balls. That's mostly what Lockie has been doing this innings. Thought the batsmen would have noticed by now.,1
Maybe Ferguson should‚Äôve bowl the World Cup super over,28
"Well this is a waste of time. Might as well've not scored those 17 runs of that last over.

Also super overs should not exist in table games. Knockout games only",1
The last time a fast bowler singlehandedly won a match for KKR with some ferocious pace was Shoaib in the first IPL. This performance by Lockie is not so far off.,22
I am dead from inside,4
Rohit Sharma Out.,2
Just ‚úå,2
Bairstow not even seeing a single delivery lol.,7
Man I want to watch the Post match presentation & see Warner,5
Which team is trying to throw this game harder,8
"Morgan vs Rashid Khan 2.0, let's see it.",6
"Ferguson, nortje, rabada, bumrah. Freaking express pacers. I love this year's ipl man",10
What was Warner trying to do,7
"What do we reckon, could Dhoni win this super over?",4
Eoin Morgan simply does not loses close matches. It's insane,9
I wonder who will get man of the match. Tough call today.,2
No way a spinner defends 3 runs,1
End this match fast. Just throw it above keeper to the boundary.,10
Bairstow should've taken the strike,2
It‚Äôs actually fair because KKR should‚Äôve won the first time around,6
"With current KKR form, they can still lose from here",4
"MI vs Kings xi 
2.4 overs 
23 runs",5
Every other team is struggling to choose their playing 11 due to so many options while we are still picking Jadhav for no apparent reason. Fuck you CSK management,4
Srh practicing as if its gonna be a bowl out!!,5
Can someone volunteer to steal Baz's notebook? I want to see all the doodling he is doing...,10
Scenes if srh win,6
Can KKR do this? üôÑ,6
Never seen SRH so disjointed and defeated.,5
Send in Rana/Karthik and Morgan,3
"Who will win?

100 eggheads and their stinky decisions or 1 fast boi?",5
üîê furgeson,6
Next year kkr should retain Lockie for sure,7
"""welcome Lord Hyderabad""

--  Lord Chennai",7
Did Ferguson play World cup finals?,4
Morgan just wanted to win in a super over to fuck with Kanos,10
Perfect for Shubham gill now. A nice 3(6) will get them home here.,14
"Morgan

Dk

Cummins for kkr

Cant trust other",5
"Looks like the writers wanted the super over. Guess what? They are running out of time.

'Send in Lockie and get it over with quickly!'",5
Warner is dying inside,4
"No way a spinner defends 3 in a super over, has to be Nattu",2
Can Ferguson and Cummins switch contracts?,6
The game has more stupid decisions taken than all the matches combined in this season so far.,1
Shubhman Gill?????? I've seen everything,3
"Rashid can take 2 wickets for two runs, brace yourselves for another super over",1
"Russell defended the last over, Lockie made a decisive blow. So KKR is gonna be the 4th team.",3
Meanwhile Bairstow at the other end just watching a shit show,7
"4 of his wickets have been timber, fucking gold",3
BC sharma out/???,2
Don't fucking send in Gill,3
Damn Rohit's gone already. Lol.,1
Wtf Gill?,3
KKR better not screw this chase atleast,2
Warner will remember this the next time NZ tour Aus,1
Time for Rashid Khan's redemption arc vs Morgan,4
Tried to upload the 4.3 overs of Ferguson on Pornhub. They deleted saying it is too extreme.,9
lets see who bowls - interesting game for sure,1
"r/watchpeopledieinside

David Warner",11
Perfect time for Gill to open n prove his class,3
I hope we should finish last this season atleast this way management will open their eyes.,2
Only reason this game is in super over is because of braindead decision from KKR management.,6
Please don't send Russell in.,1
Put Lockie in to bat he can do no wrong,3
Why do I keep waking up at 6 AM for these disappointments,9
Seriously speaking this looks like scripted.,2
"Hold on guys, I see another twist incoming",1
Jonny should have been on Strike in the first place,1
2/2 is the joint-lowest Super Over score in IPL equalling KXIP against DC earlier in the season,7
"Terrible management decision to send Samad, who has never timed a fucking ball in his life, over Rashid. May as well let Thampi bowl the super over",5
"It's lost!
It's freaking Gill. What's the management smoking!",1
Damn Kanos always on the wrong side of super overs üò§,8
"KKR fans will riot if Lockie doesn't keep playing for the rest of the season, even after Narine comes back. Take Russell out if you have to, don't touch my boy Lockie.",11
Batting 2nd in super over is a massive advantage because you know what approach to make,3
Lockie Ferguson was unplayable today,13
Never seen two teams trying to lose a match harder,10
One good thing is that there are even more shit teams than us and we are still 5th LMAO after 6 losses in 9 games,4
Inb4 Gill comes in and plays 3 dot balls,7
reminder that if morgan‚Äôs team ties with williamson‚Äôs morgan wins,12
Perfect Super Over for Tuk Tuk Gill,6
Why didn't Rashid attempt the 2nd run?,7
"Absolute no brainer. They have to drop Russel and bring Narine in. Lockie Cummins Narine and Morgan. Solid bowling, good batting. No more of this steroid nibba.",8
Warner going to kill someone today,7
Allow kedhar jadhav to bat u cowards,8
f-ing send lockie to get the 3 runs!,14
"~~Sunrisers~~ Sunsetters Hyderabad

The problem is as a team we couldn't string 2 boundaries together.,4
"SRH was pretty consistent in the other seasns till now, this looks liek a bad season for SRH , shit happens. Hope we bounce back next season! :)",6
Ferguson vs abd. Battle of the titans. Cant wait for that match-up,6
Strategic superover by alpha Morgz to remind everyone that he is the superover God,3
 Gill padded up,3
"Gill is going to score the 2 runs and get into form like Kohli, after the least pressure super overs",7
The educated thing to do is play for singles and not hack slash. I hope they have some sense.,3
I think I just figured out CSK's script for their next match,2
Narine-esque over incoming from rashid,3
Was Williamson too heart broken to bat in superover?,10
Warner is distraught!,3
Ferguson's mustache is so much better than Warner's,7
Ferguson vs ABD next game then,6
Hurry up! Want to see MI match! And Star Sports 2 is not workingüòÅ,2
Gill surely? sub100 SR is his area of expertise.,8
Remember when Alzari Joseph for 6fer on debut,1
"OK, please tell me y'all are rooting for Kings XI in the other match. Bottom 4 teams with the same points will be fun.",4
Vijay Shankar is like a killer disappointment in batting.,3

KKR playing shitty cricket and still winning. Name a more iconic duo.,4

"Based on this match performance I am sure SRH will never qualify as fourth team. First three teams this year will be MI, DC and RCB. The fourth team will be KKR based on the performance of Lockie Ferguson.",5
I can't remember his name but there was a guy who played for MI who took 6 wickets for 14 runs against SRH and became injured in next match and did not play again. What happened to him?,3
Mavi‚Äôs penultimate over was everything,3
[deleted],2
"If Rashid Khan bowls this, Gill and Rana should come in",2
Gill over Rana makes no fucking sense.,3
Gill should retire from IPL already. He should follow Pujara's lead and play county.,1
KKR haven't won a superover yet in IPL,2
"Morgan DK and Rana, pls find a rope and tie Gill on to the chair just for 10 minutes",2
Do super over wickets count in purple cap?,5
WHAT. IS. THIS. GULLY. CRICKET. BULLSHIT??? THIS IS LIKE SOME CASUAL EXHIBITION MATCH BETWEEN SOME STAR PLUS SERIAL ACTORS!!!!,10
It‚Äôs the power of that 69 jersey guys,4
How do you have an 18 year old as your biggest  hitter is beyond me. on the other hand 11 Cr for Manish Pandey who does nothing. What a horrible decision from the management,4
Ferguson with that mustache and 69 shirt number is the ultimate chad out there.,10
Is DK still vice captain?,2
Morgan and dk wow,1
Warner looks tired and frustrated as Rashid Khan limbers up to bowl,1
Warner looks dead inside,1
Morgan and DK batting? Gg,1

At least one kiwi is winning super over today,6

Morgan bunny bowling against Morgan,3
"In IPL, SRH will be remembered more for their consistently worst middle order than their bowling",3
"Eoin Morgan and DK to open for KKR, Gill will be their third batter

fuck",3
It would take some KXIPesque chasing to choke from here,6
"Another super over ,another loss for Williamson.

Thankfully he isn't the captain this time,but will still affect him.Kinda feel sad for him",5
This mustached bowler took 5 wickets in a T20 match with this one simple trick. SRH hate him!,14
"Bringing in Ferguson today by KKR is just ""What a change over mama""",5
SRH look like a bunch who are gonna get dick slapped by murali in the changing rooms,10
How the hell did SRH mess up this chase,10
Who is SRH coach with the sunhat?,4
Aren't you supposed to tell the umpire your batsmen and bowler before the super overs begin?,1

Ferguson- Cummo >>>>>>> Boult-Pattinson and Rabada-Nortge,6
You can watch other match in another channel.,3
Lockie is super chad with that 69 jersey number and the porn stache,10
Just finish this shit. I want to watch the other game.,9
"Williamson crying NZ didn't play Ferguson in the WC Final, he could have won them the super over",16

The no. 69 seems apt for Ferguson today. Fucked SRH.,13

"4 losses in a row season over. Next IPL is in 5 months time to just plan for that, Samad is going to be a big part of the team. I would drop Manish and give Virat Singh a chance.",8
Lockie better get a huge fucking payrise next year.,12
Why are captains taking this 3000 IQ decisions?,6
"OH MAN, LOCKIE CHANGED THIS KKR SIDE",11
Gill next up is genius cos he scores at twice the RRR,8

Morgan just wanted to tonk Rashid Khan again. Brilliant captaincy.,5
Jabaradasti ka drama by Morgan,3
Wtf is cricket even,8
Star Sports really milking the most out of a poor match,7
This superover is another reminder of how shit we are.,8
Bro SRH are really stacked with captain. They have Williamson they also have WI captain holder. And he can't get a game. Just release them ffs. Holder would be an automatic pick in most teams.,7
i mean like c'mon dk should have been on strike. he is better against spin than morgan for sure,1
How dumb. There were 2 runs there,2
KKR are lucky they arent KXIP,7
Lanjavudu,0
"Morgan v Rashid

Classic combo",3
I'm pretty sure Morgan waited to see who'll bowl before deciding that he'll face the over.,5
Lmao Lockie with the number 69 too. Memes for ages.,9
Karthik and Morgan batting. This is just so funny.,8
"Fuckin hit a boundary and finish this. 
Don't you dare take this to the last ball.",7
"SRH fans the song you wanna hear right now is ""In the End by Linkin Park""",6

KKR making 3 runs look like 300 runs,36
This is the most downbeat super over I have ever seen,14

ok. complete PAISA VASOOL!!!!,2
Aight I am an rcb fan now,10
Lmfao what a mess of a game,7
SRH deserves credit for making even the super over a boring affair,10

Ah well, Morgan beats Williamson and Warner again.",7

"Why was Manish Pandey, Warner, Garg not fielding inside circle? And Sandip Sharma was??",7
Give Ferguson all the awards in this match.,35
Warner looks so clueless about hitting boundaries it was close only because of an injured Russel bowling,24
