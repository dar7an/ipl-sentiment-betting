His pace is also part of the issue, he's fast enough so that the ball easily comes onto the bat to be dispatched (especially off his standard back of a length delivery), but he's not a  consistently 145kph+ bowler like Nortje or Ferguson who can overwhelm batsmen by the sheer speed of his bowling.

If he went at a lower price I'm sure that he'd be playing far better than he is now, he currently has to deal with the pressure of performing every time for a high price which he did not demand himself.",4

The soft signal is out. He reached out a touch and just flicked this in the end. Lockie covered the ground to his left, caught it, and then put in a backhand flick to long-on. They're checking it upstairs. His right boot, on the balancing step, comes very very close to the boundary padding. He is confident about it. And this should remain out given there's no way to conclusively say the foot touched the padding. There's hardly a ripple there. And yes, it does stay out.

That was a pretty shitty captaincy at the end. Mavi should have bowled 18th & 20th over, and Ferguson the 19th over. People praising Morgan's captaincy now would have criticized him had KKR lost.",20
