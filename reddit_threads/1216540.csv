They have similar team like MI, long batting line up with explosive batsmen... One of world's best fast bowler and we all know Narine.. And impressive young indian talents.. Don't know how things have gone wrong for them.. They seemed like table toppers this season",2
Haha Swanny calling KKR clowns.,3
I understand that SKY has been playing good last few years and he deserved a spot in the team. But doesn't  justify to shit on all other players.,5
Faf would've caught that,3
Ngidi and Chahar are bowling out next few overs,2
Kkr has the least fans in r/cricket,8
I wish our team would use Rashid as a floater. Dude comes after all wickets are down and required rate is too high. We should utilise his batting skills as well in a perfect way like Narine.,8
This is going to be another boring chase.,3
Bring on Ngidi.,3

Sunil and Pant are two sides of the same coin,3
"**8.3** Santner to Narine, OUT, **taken at deep midwicket.** Tosses this up slowly at a middle and leg line. He's hitting into the longer side. And he can't clear the fielder with the slog. Floats nicely out to Jadeja who takes it inisde the line **60-2**

Aight bois imma head out. Ez win for CSK,0
KKR demoting tripathi to no 4 is one of the dumbest moves ever. He's a top order batsman. Nitish was perfect at no 3. Why do they need to tinker with the lineup?,8

Just when I got inspired to write a poem about Rinku Ji. My life is over.,7
"So kkr has wasted 18 balls for 18 runs and 2 wickets, do they not realise this is a must win match",8
Why is he even playing,1
"Guess Baz writing a Book
 *101 ways to screw up a batting order*",9
Shouldn't have taken that wicket!!,3
I legit thought Rinku was hired help...,5
and so ends rinku singh's IPL career,9
RAMBO^^TM Generator disabled temporarily,3
That would have been a 6 in Chinnaswamy Stadium where Rinku truly belongs.,3
Poor Rinku plays 2 or 1 game per season without making any impact,10
"Sorry guys, Chill !! Rinku can't read Reddit messages when batting!!",1
Murugan (Morgan) finally walks in. He should have come after Narine,5
"WTF, why didn't they take the timeout after that wicket. Assholes!",-2
Someone please remind KKR this is a must win game for them.,5
come on CSK get Morgan out early and limit their score to 150,5
Rinku is basically like a up gangster who dances with the actress in a desi song,5
who tf interrupted these ads with cricket,6
"DK as a finisher, where he is best suited in. KKR learnt the lesson too late.",5
And finally Quick Gun MorGun walks in,4
Captain Morgan for the win,1
"There is an unwritten rule where slow innings of batsmen especially those up the order are criticized less than big overs given by bowlers in large chases.


Rahanes infamous knock in t20 wc semifinal and Manan Vohra 67 of 45 odd in IPL final are 2 innings I can think off which deserve fair criticisms and cannot use the 'in hindsight everything is clear' excuse.",2
Nowadays it's a surprise with KKR when Nagarkoti doesn't walk in at 5.,6
Comms went from shipping Morgs+Big Mac to doubting Big Mac's influence on Morg in a matter of 3 matches.,4
KKR will be happy with 160-165 from here on,5
"13 matches, 1000 pages of notes later, KKR still haven't got their batting order figured",14
Heeheeheehee hasde re Rinku ke papa,2
Atleast they are playing DK in his natural position,6
Mccullum as a coach is like that guy in the club who tries too hard to impress and get rejected by everyone.,6
Rinku Singh still played better than Virat Kohli yesterday.,9
"A friend of mine is having a party tonight and was planning to watch this match, fully, whilst hosting 20 foreigners who would think ""IPL"" stands for ""Immigration Protection Laws"".  

Forget calculators and papers and NRR. This is the new level of dedication from CSK fans.",13
Just give the trophy to MI and end the tournament. All the other teams are playing like shit.,7
Does KKR have to win this game to have a chance at qualification?,4
Scenes if KKR collapses now and everyone praises rinku for preventing one,7
"Wonder why has Tom Curran saved Sam's number as 'Sam Curran ENG' does he know any other Sam Currans? 

https://mobile.twitter.com/TC59/status/1177188893453705216/photo/1",6
KKR vs The World,8
[deleted],4
"Altroz shows up
Swann: ""meri ek tang nakali h me, hockey...""",7
"If Carun Vakravarthy doesn't fuck up CSK's batting order, they have this in the bag.",1
This gotta be the mist bizarre line up KKR have tried this season,10
When you have Tripathi who has been in some decent form you send Rinku who is playing his first game. All in a must win game.,15
Seriously has no one asked McCullum what he keeps  writing all the time?,5
KKR can still qualify if they win 1 out 2 matches. Only if they're lucky enough,2
"Baz writing SRK's next movie , coaching gig was just for tax purposes",7
Rana needs to accelerate,1
"Everyone is shitting on KKR, but they could make 120 and CSK would still struggle to chase it down",7
Karn sharma bowling action looks like he will bowl 140 km/hr,1
Just give 9 uncapped players with potential to mi (we keeping boom and pollard) and watch them win all games,0
McCullum was one of KKR's four captains in 2009. He must have smoked the good stuff with John Buchanan.,6
"McCullum : Good keeper, Better batsman and Best selling author",2
"Kohli scores at <120 SR: *Tuk tuk behenchod*

Rana scores at <115 SR: *Regained his touch. Batting sensibly*",9
"Rahul Tripathi delivers MOM performance against CSK opening the batting.
KKR: Their bowlers have no answer for you. You deserve a handsome reward. 
Rahul : A permanent opening spot? 
KKR : The coveted number 8 spot the next time we play CSK!",8
This Rana 50 gonna burn the hopes of KKR in Playoffs you heard it here first.,1
"Yeah if this team can't realize that this is a must win game and they need boundaries instead of singles, then we don't deserve to make the playoffs. This shit is just stupid.",5
"On an off note, what's your favorite lays flavour?",7
Bowl Curran ffs!,1
Kkr is just trying to play 20 overs without losing 5 wickets.,9
Hey! this is the first time I have ever been cheering for CSK!,7
Need atleast 80 from Rana,2
Yo I missed the third wicket. Who was out and how?,2
"So Chahar -2, Ngidi -2 and Curran - 2 after this",2
I wouldn't be surprised if Baz has been writing an Adult Love story about a cricketer,1
Below 170 will be troublesome for KKR,3
Bloody hell 14th over and still haven't reached a hundred,6
Tactical ™,3
Sangakkarra not mincing words about Rana's low strike rate.,2
Karn Sharma has been good today,1
[deleted],8
We nearly saw Karn bump into Curran,8
New lenskart ad right there,3
No need to take that  catch and bring death over DK to the crease,1
Anyone watches tmkoc ?,-6
Getting Rahane's 40(35) vibes,2
150-160 looks like the target's gonna be today,1
" KKR is finding new ways to disappoint fans in every match, what a franchise!",5
"KKR have one of the dumbest thinktanks.  
Rinku Singh was a stupid disaster and Morgan has an IPL s/r of 124.  
Unless CSK absolutely CSKs this we will lose by the 17th over",1
I think KKR played Rinku Singh jist to add to their arsenal of left handers to counter chennai spinners which doesn't look that bad on paper tbh. Buy what is the point of saving your best batsman for so late.,3
" **KKR's slowest fifty this season**. Fifty - duck - fifty for Rana,",1
Oh ffs Curran is not gonna bowl his full quota again,6
Karn Sharma is a KKR bully. I still remember he derailed them in 2017 Qualifier 2 while playing for MI.,4
"@RCB fans

Do we support CSK for qualification purpose or KKR for rivalry purposes?",3
"**Morgan & Baz leadership**

Expectations - Super Aggressive cricket

Reality - Bad management decisions",14
"Nitish ""I can only sweep"" Rana",6
Smh Dhoni not giving Jadeja any tips,1
Have you guys ever eaten at a 5 star restaurant??,-1
Boring teams,2
"Obviously every team plays at their absolute best against us, incidentally when we play at our worst. Just DD things",2
Jaddu bowling pace as a changer :),1
Dhoni scared poor umpire again. /s,3
Where is mohit sharma (aka nohit sharma jr) these days? he always wore a sad expression on his face while playing,1
"Baz is writing his own version of The Art of War.

To confuse the enemy you must first confuse yourself. If you can't anticipate your next move, what chance does the enemy have?",5
" Tripathi, DK and Cummins are there and they sent Rinku to waste 11 balls.",4
Was about to give wide then he remembered he’s umpiring against Dhoni,5
"Umpires shit scared of calling wides in front of Dhoni, it seems!",6
"On 14.4, felt like umpire was  about to stretch his hands to indicate wide, but saw MSD on the other end.",4
"1e+147

If you know you know",3
"Wide surely, arms twitched I swear. Dhoni putting the fear of God into the umpires again.",6
150?,1
"Rinku's chapter is over for KKR. He played so many seasons for KKR, but never for once did he made an impactful innings, not even once.",2
Wanted KKR to win but then I realised CSK winning would help us out!,1
Morgan should just hit the wickets with the bat to let the finisher DK come in.,1
where is rahul sharma these days? he never batted an eyelid when bowling against a tough batsman.,1
[deleted],1
Guys unrelated but a question - so many test bowlers are known for unerring accuracy when bowling good length balls . Why aren't they accurate for bowling Yorkers then? Why is it more difficult to be accurate for Yorkers.,2
"Last 5 overs should be 

Curran - 16 and 18

Ngidi - 17 and 19

Chahar - 20th 

No need to risk spin from now

Edit : Karn ffs. This is absolute nonsense from Dhoni",2
Is Jagdeesan playing?,1
"are reviews only for wickets? or can the teams use them for other contradictory rulings? like wides, etc",1

How many points does srh need to get to make it to the playoffs for the FairPlay Awards? Where are the finals being held?,6
Rana has been good today but he needs to minimize the amount of dots he plays,3
thats like 2 sixes in 30 seconds,7
Why is hotstar still playing whitehat jr ads? Weren’t they banned?,11
Karn showing his balls to Rana,16

Oof that was a gut punch over for CSK.,3

i still wonder why karn sharma was selected on that Oz tour... and why pankaj singh on that Eng tour... and Dhawal kulkarni on that NZ tour... and why tinu yohanan was once in the squad,7
Should've taken the catch earlier. Rana gives no second chances.,5
"KKR had actually built a great top 4 around Lynn, who struggles against spin. Narine, Uthappa and Rana all spin bashers who 'protected' Lynn.",8
Damn that new Josh ad has just raised the level of cringe,7

That's a four. F,6

Rayadu almost showing his inner *2D*,2
Ranaji get that 100 today,3
"Still no idea, why captains and management are taking this super high IQ decisions. Changing a out of form player with similar player is understandable.

"_Fun fact:_ nobody, apart from Baz in the very first match of IPL, has scored a century for KKR.",8
The only way to make the fair play table have **any** significance is to award a 20% bonus if you are also in top 2 of Fairplay. 10% bonus if you're at 3 or 4.,1
Rana has played really well for last couple of IPLs and he can bowl few overs too. If not for Virat he should have been in team,-3
Ranaji for century ⊙﹏⊙,4
So are we doing \#RanaForIndiaLOI tonight?,11
"I'm pretty sure if Rinku Singh goes to Mumbai Indian, he will become Yuvraj Singh because they manage their players so well and build their confidence.",2
"For a strike bowler, D Chahar has been very ordinary this IPL.",1
"If Morgan wanted to take singles, why not just go in place of Rinku. Seriously, what the fuck?",2
Rana's very visible weakness is a quick short ball targeted to his body. CSK today just doesn't have a bowler who can bowl at that pace and trouble him.,3
What's par score here?,1
How does a commentator who is paid to be there not recognize who is batting?,2
Why would you bowl chahar when you got lungi and curran with 2 overs each remaining lmao,-1
Csk can’t chase anything above 170 without faf and 170 is looking like a cakewalk rn,1
What is Morgan even trying to achieve here? You're playing an extra batsman today.. should look to get a boundary every ball,5

"So Sam Curran bowls 2 good overs up front, is CSK's best death bowler (Bravo's injured so doesn't count) and yet he only gets one at the death?

As I say this, Morgan spanks him for 4 lmao",8
Jagdeesan kinda looks like Bumrah,3
"https://youtu.be/zu4K_zDAC-I
Be brave to listen to this",3
Ouch!,3
"Mom: We have Jadeja at home

At home:",10
"Yes Morgan, pound that ass",4
Karthik at 6 is different gravy,11
Sam Curran will.star in next season of cuties: the cricket version,9
Morgan has pounded him before,10
175+ and KKR are set,4
"Hope KKR atleast score 175.

With no pressure will be interesting to see how much intent CSK show today.

Not like it matters even if we lose.",3
DK does what he does best.,8
Now this is the spot for DK.,6
"This innings shows exactly why DK needs to be a finisher and not bat at 4

Brilliant start",5
16(5) have we seen this before ?,2
Kartik is a finisher. Finally he's playing how he should play. FINALLY BAZZZ,10
They are just toying with CSK now.,5
DK is a good finisher. Who would have thought?,6
THIS IS DK THE FINISHER! FUCK YOU BAZ!,6
I cant describe how happy i am,4
CSK be like: lol ya thought we'd help you?,2
Dk selected for aus?,6
So if kkr wins today are the other bottom teams out of the playoff race?,4
Dk just confirmed his spot for the next season,8
Every slo mo of Curran's reaction to his bowling looks like he just nutted in his pants,11
"So finally, FINALLY KKR have their batting order correct huh.",4
"As a Delhi fan, I want my team to smash everyone and so it doesn’t matter who makes it to the playoffs.

But then reality dawns on me and I realise we will lose to whoever makes it to the playoffs.

In both cases, it actually does not matter who makes the playoffs for me!",1
Just a reminder DK not in the squad going to Aus,1
"fun fact - IAS exams of 2017 had a question - ""Which sub-contintent bowler caused most nervousness among Indian cricket viewers?"" And the only option available was Ashok Dinda.",2
"DK playing well at 6.

KKR: should we open with him next game?",6
Where are the fuckin Yorkers man.,2
This is the DK I like. 10 ball 25 runs kind of a DK,3
Swann is talking nonsense all the time its irritating,4
"Dhoni really has nothing to lose.

He won the toss decided to chase.",2
I just hope DK transfers over to RCB next year. We need him and he seems to be done with kkr.,2
Last 21 balls 53 runs hmmmmmmmmm,3
So 2 no ball 6 and two additional sixes in ngidi over?,2
Jokes on other team fans wanting csk to do well today. Eat shit snowflakes ha ha ha,5
No Way CSK are chasing 175+,5
India is lacking a player who is a finisher like DK and bats at 5-6. Shame on Selectors I say!,4
Imagine sending Narine and Rinku ahead of DK and Morgan.,0
"It's almost like if you let batsmen play at their preferred position, they perform well.",16
Karthik on nidhas trophy mode,6
"honestly man, DK is just as good of a finisher as Pandya, if not better, at his peak. He’s got a lot more variety / flexibility, which makes him harder to bowl to. KKR should have played him at this stage more.",8
So Curran and Chahar going to end up with 3 overs each?  So why keep Karn till the 16th over. This was just asking to be hit.,8
[deleted],2
6 bowlers and still getting hit 😭😭,5
DK playing well as a finisher. Watch him sent at one down in the all important next match.,9
"I tuned in pretty late, why is Curran not bowling his full quota?",5
Go berserk here score 25 off 8 and kill the match,6
"smh, just hoping at this point CSK keeps it close so KKR's net run rate isn't crazy",8
List of top 20 run scorers this tournament?,8
graeme swann has officially lost it,17
Tamil partiality from umpire,17
"With every run DK and Morgan taking here, I feel like they are kicking out SRH and RR out of the tournament as well.",12
DK wanted that ball to be wide 😁,6
Lol DK trying to fish for that Wide,6
Chill umpire Lmao,10
DK talking to the ump in Tamil,8
"1 good innings and people start saying this guy is perfect get him in, now DK would be best at this spot but this is just 1 innings he has been pretty average the whole season.",9
Why is the ump talking in telugu,37
Telugu lol,34
[deleted],15
Maybe dk falls into the same category as root. Good batsmen but gets burdened by captaincy,16
I think weighed average is a better metric to judge a player. We should obviously give more weight to recent performances. Realised this after people are using career stats to diss on players,5
Lopala chala lopala,10
is it better for rcb if kkr win,2
"DK AND UMPIRE CHILLING IN TAMIL WTFFF!😂😂

edit: yeah it was telugu my bad :(",14
Dk not picked for Aussie tour. Poltiks by big bully Kohli,17
The Umpire spoke in Telugu wtf,15
Can CSK actually be the master chasers they once were in their hayday? Lets see.,7
DK and umpire speaking in Telugu. LOL,16
DK you are no MS,8
"175 is still great from here , anything more will be bonus",6
 Is 175-180 a good score on this pitch?,2
Who would've guessed that if you play Snake Karthik in his natural position he would get you the required boundaries?!,12
WTF the ump is speaking pure Hyderabad telugu to Karthik  !,7
Why do they keep panning to Gill,5
TIL dk can speak Telugu,15
"Moreover, DK in finishing plays very selflessly - the think needed the most for any finisher. Never worries about his wicket, and always thinks about the team.",17
Shameful by Kohli didn't pick DK & Rana mud on the face performance.,5
"The stage is set for CSK to play a test match innings, hit 3 sixes in the last over and then lose by 17 runs.",18
In before another DK apology thread,7
Lungi's nips are always hard,9
"Lungi using the ancient Greek ""nipple distraction technique""",9
I think DK did well in every match where he came in to finish. Right? in IPL 2020,5
Have you guys noticed that we are t getting those overconfident Delhi fanboys here now🤔,3
Sky is not in team DK is not in team Pant is not in team. What's the point of touring Aus I say 😞,6
"Lungi, no 30 run last over pls!!",6
Morgan has sr 123 in ipl. Interesting!,8
Chahar not bowling the 20th????,3
"Well, DK did say he liked Bommarillu",9
"Dhoni after the match: I think it played well in the first innings. Unfortunately, slowed down dramatically in the second innings to about 120ish which we scored. We have to go back to the drawing board and focus on the process. Thank you.",15
"Some comments here say Telugu, but isn’t that Tamil?",3
Watson grandpa need a stick to jump,4
"Umpire was like ""Lopula chaala lopula ... chance kuda ledu"" or something..",5
"nobody : 

armchair experts : jaldi jaldi match laga deta hoon phir players ko gaandu bhi bolna hai.",16
Morgan has a very smol dick energy as a finisher.,8
Dk should have run a single at last ball of 19th over,4
What are the chances that watto cries after his last match in ipl. I think he will definitely cry.,6
Is it laras day off @ dugout?,5
Legend Ngidi is back after conceding 27 in 2 balls 😍,6
"Bibhu Prasad Jayguru on CricBuzz says he is a MSD fan and wants to see vintage MSD tonight, or will tear up for sure.

I say, spoiler alert, he will tear up.",6
Hope Watson retires. It's honestly sad watching him like this. Used to enjoy watching him taking bowlers to the cleaners and field fantastically during uni.,6
DK is so much better as a finisher. I've never seen him build a big innings coming in at 20/3. But he's one of those players who can start hitting from ball 1 when he has the license.,41
"Irish Eoin vs English Eoin

Styris vs swanny",7
"Me (starting to watch the match from 16th over, finally thinking of supporting csk for once), sees Tahir left out and KKR not messing the batting oder: Aight, KKR it is",6
Irish eoin gone!,5
"A player scores 50 in one match

r/cricket : Kohli was stupid to not pick him for Aus tour.",47
Ayyyy Tripathi the finisher,9
Morgan should step down from captaincy to focus on his batting,9
What could Morgan possibly say to DK in the final over? What the ideal score would be?,6
"Ohh, we have Tripathi too :(  
RINKU WASN'T NEEDED AT ALL!!! Should have played Kuldeep or Mavi.",13
This is the perfect position for DK. It's go time and he knows how to go,6
DK's mother tongue is actually telugu and not tamil.,10
Wtf? Why isn't Tripathi at 9? Cummins and nagarkoti are left,7
i thought ngidi wasnt a part of this season wtf,6
"**19.2** Ngidi to Morgan, OUT, **taken at long-off.** Full slower ball wide outside off. Walks into the off side this time and is still forced to reach out. Wants to loft over extra cover but gets it only a couple of yards to long-off's right **167-5**

EJG Morgan c Gaikwad b Ngidi 15 (12b 2x4 0x6) SR: 125.00",1
"Dk as finisher 📈📈📈📈📈
Dk at 4 📉📉📉📉📉",18
Why are there two Karthiks batting rn?,8
KKR been clowning on Tripathi the entire season.,9
Morgan and DK talking after Morgan's wicket. fIxIng COnFiRmeD  ?,8
I love the way Scott pronounces Ruthuraj.,6
"Rinku experiment failed,like everything else KKR tries",19
Use dk the right way and he will not disappoint. Be it for india or kkr,35
Wtf has Tripathi done to deserve this treatment by the management,5
"Commentator : These 6 balls you just want to throw your bat at everything.

Instant flashback to Pollard nearly smacking Starc with his bat.",8
Kohli fans are so passive aggressive on this thread. Still salty about yesterday!,10
Why is it every time Morgan performs DK sucks and vice versa,16
CSK will miss kedar jadhav : the immovable object. He was their best test player. He could play a lot of dead defences in this score.,15
"KKR played Rinku as an antidote for Monu, but MSD change the team at the last moment.",15
It all depends on Ruturaj and Watson. How they open will decide the fate for CSK. Their middle order has been shite this season.,9
Pretty sure they put ngidi in csk just cus he has lungi(sani) in his name,8
"Oh look, Opener Tripathy opening when 3 balls are left",14
DK and DK doppelgänger playing together,19
Tripathi batting demeanor reminds me of dk,9
I'm gonna ride the bandwagon and say Rana for the indian team 2020,2
[deleted],6
Ngidi bowled well here ngl,10
[deleted],7
"It honestly just sad and painful watching CSK be like this. The entire team was absolutely lethal and always performed extremely well.

Just sad tbh",6
Great last 3 deliveries from Ngidi - i love me the South African bowlers,7
"Calm down guys, Tripathi was in for a collapse. Didn't happen today though.",14
Rahul tripathi is reverse sehwag he started as opener and now plays at 7.,14
Rinku Singh Ji ko please Australia le jaao.,9
"Curran went from finisher to opener for CSK 

Tripathi went from opener to finisher for KKR lol",30
Is 172 above par here?,7
Surprised Jadeja didn't go for the catch there.,6
"Yeah, just 3 fours  lol",1
"Decent Total.
Now watch CSK play for NRR and get all out at 124.",16
Is 172 good enough?,4
Kholi and Indian selectors are so shitty they overlooked Ngidi for the the Aus tour. Even Morgan would be handy but they picked Umesh Yadav ffs . Kholis ego will hurt team india 😔,28
"With a remodelled action, Thala finally has an opportunity to score a boundary off Narine",7

66/2.. wow good going CSK,5
Big dick Tripathi finishes with a SR of 150,11
"KKR is 15 runs short, I think. They will have to bowl really well to win this.",17
How much water do you think Lungi loses in one inning?,6
"CSK, please for the love of SPARK, chase this down and do everyone else a favor",23
Most of these players look like they are ready to go home.,3
"Juhi's still got it, damn",14
CSK will pick up DK next auction,7
"KKR, Stop costing these 15-20 crucial runs by changing the batting order.

Gill-Rana, Tripathi, Morgan, Narine/DK, Cummins should be the batting order.",22
Where's Nitish Rana apology thread??,4
What's par score on this stadium?,4
Excellent job by Rahul Tripathi the opener in carrying the bat for his team,8
Choke Specialist Kings are gonna get bowled out at 116 and Thala will blame lack of sparks in the dew on the pitch,10
"172. Not bad KKR. Not bad at all. 

We have a wonderful 2nd innings to look forward to",12
Dare I even hope? :(,2
As if CSK are going to tuk tuk their way anywhere close to this total.,10
As a life long CSK fan since I saw the latest probability post..this performance means so much to me,6
10 runs short,3
Yea this feels like one of those games where we lose by 10-12 runs. I hope I'm wrong tho,8
"Gosh darn it, I am a DK fanboi",13
"I feel like DC will be the one to drop off the top 4 and kkr and punjab will make it in. Dc has no real match winner in batting. Pant has been terrible all season. Iyer is, well iyer. Stoinis is all muscles no brains. Hetmyer gets good starts but fails to build innings. Also their running between the wickets is bad. Their bowling is good tho.",12
Turns out DK can score some runs when he’s batting at the position that suits his game! I’m shocked!🤯🤯,31
[removed],-19
What has Kuldeep done to baz to be treated like that. They included Rinku in squad who did nothing valuable for the team today had they included Kuldeep their bowling would have been tremendous.,10

Let's go KKR!",9
Downvotes are to the left,-27
"Morgan should come in the middle overs (at number 4). Morgan is not a finisher, but DK is.",2
When every other want csk to win they won the toss and decided to chase.,3
Imagine caring about CSK,-2
"I know KKR batting line up is fucked up but the hypocrisy of these commentators and experts is apalling. When Karthik bats @4 they call him to bat as a finisher. When a youngster is send @4, They are saying a youngster shouldn't be at 4. If Tripathi would have been sent, they would have said this is not his natural position. He should open.",9
Heard this sub is giving free money? Where do I sign up?,6
"very solid score, KKR should definitely be able to defend it. Or perhaps we could see some Dhoni heroics today. Push for a half century, could be his last chance",4
"Just imagine havin brendon as coach,  morgan as a captian,  shubman gill, nitish rana, rahul tripathi as openers, sunil narine as middle order and dk as finisher still having the worst batting performance",33

Mr East India Company has to get in Watson's face and it's smooth sailing for Chennai,3
"Goodbye, I am not gonna watch this match, Watson will become fucking chris gayle against us. Unfair for us, This year is not for kkr, So lets go to sleep and hope we win the last match for a morale victory",5
"lol, Bangar got triggered for no reason",3
Lol why can’t Sanjay admit the problem but then give examples of guys like Kohli who absolutely own short pitched express bowling,-1
Has any bowler ever bowled a wide that was so high it went for 6?,9
Pat Cummins 15 crores turning me a socialist,7
Safe to say KKR aren't going to waste 15.5 Cr on Cummins next Season. Will probably buy him back at a lesser price,8
Ah shit. A new josh ad..,8
"The belly's putting a bit more pressure on the uniform than it used to, and he huffs and puffs a bit after a quick single, but by God it still looks good when Watson hits a clean boundary. Beautiful striker of the white ball. Really hope this IPL isn't the last we see of him.",5
"which one?

https://i.imgur.com/q0N2D9t.jpg",4
"Sanjay Bangar embarrassed us Indians by saying "" indians play short ball well""😭😂😭😂",8
Gayle and Mandeep exposed CEO of East India company last match. Batsman should take him on with confidence now.,5
Why doesnt kkr bowl ferguson in the pp?,1
I almost forgot that rinku is the specialist fielder,4
Lol I love Styris. Respectful but brooks no bullshit.,7
"I'm jealous of IPL ""commentators "". Live a good life",5
I want an ODI IPL,13
Anime slo mo shot,2
Bangar still thinking he is Indian batting coach.,9
11 dot balls in the first 18 balls of powerplay,4
That length is what Watto would put deep into midwicket if it was any bowler but Narine lol,4
"Ah players not being mic'ed up in the field, still remember Shaw saying cant hear, hello when asked who is better Dada or Punter",20
may be last time we see watto if he gets a score here,6
Peak Narine,2
[deleted],1
Is Narine even spinning the ball any more? Looks like medium pace to me,18
"As someone who likes wearing two caps but has been ostracized for it, I want to thank Morgan for making it socially acceptable.",12
"Kohli's on field behaviour doesn't mean he'll be pissed at SKY after the match.

Okay maybe he will be, but he'll act Civil.",9
Yes SANJAY! good job on calling them out for wrong perceptions,7
Watto is gonna put pressure on poor ruturaj with these Dot balls.,4
"Today's threads looks a bit boring, looks no-one excited for this match",10
"Not looking good for KKR till now. If they get set, they might take the game away and build pressure on KKR.",1
Has the “why tf Ferguson ain’t bowling” rant started yet?,10
"Watson with SR of 100




KKR is in big trouble",3
"Watson: 125 SR 
Dhoni: par beta baat toh 110 ki hui thi nahi?",6
let me be honest csk matches are boring to watch,3
"Irrespective of what happens today, enjoy Watson's batting because it maybe the last time we are seeing him in IPL.",4
Yes Watson do what you did in that match against us,6
"Slow start from CSK, both batsmen playing at 100 or below SR. Those 5 wides make it look much better than it is",6
3 wicket spell incoming from Ferguson,4
"Watson vs Narine (T20)

16 innings | 85 balls | 89 runs | Nine dismissals | SR 104.7",7
No spark btw,2
This is why Lockie doesn’t bowl in the powerplay,8
Dae spark,7
I can't handle this much spark,7
Unrelated but I think Dhoni took Spark idea from that old F50 ad with kid Messi,2
Why does Gaikwad always stick his tongue out when batting,2
Ruturaj is 1.41 times more effective than Raj,5
He got a chance and this is happening,4
Wow what a shot from Rituraj!,5
:/,2
Sexy,3
Nice to see youngsters taking on experienced international bowlers.. heart warming to see..,6
Gaikwad straight batting Ferguson for 4 is gonna be a highlight in this IPL.,9
Gaikwad always puts his tongue out after hitting a boundary😂,6
150 pace ain't enough against that man born with SPARK^TM,7
"I figured Karthik would fire today after that GG prediction. Man, that guy should be a mascot for the jinxing people into form.",5
Morgan on why Ferguson doesn't bowl first up: Lauki is the main course not appetizer,9
Ferguson either bowls fire or shits the bed there's nothing in between,17
"Hope Watson & Gaikwad doesn't do the same thing, what they did against KXIP :(",4
Kkr players would be blinded by the spark if jagdeeshan plays with gaikwad,9
Is it just me or whenever i hear 'Taking it deep' I think of a Blowjob.,6
"Unpopular Opinion: Instead of we Indians screaming who should be picked or not picked we should also raise our voice on our batters weakness and how they can overcome it. Here's list of players and their weakness on top of my head:





Mayank, Iyer, Vihari- Short pitch balls



KL, Virat: Leg spinners


Shaw, Dhawan, Rohit, Rahane, Gill: Full pitched inswingers",11
Language Freddy. You're on camera!,5
What the watto!! go big or go home,2
"Bowls at 151.2 kmph

Kartik: There was no pace for him to pull",11
"Lmao, did fergi just say ""fuck me"" 😂

Chad cameraman",7
"I guess even in the next IPL, people will be using the Spark meme.",7
"Lol @ Lockie ""Fuck ye""",5
Those 5 wides helping CSK stay ahead of run a ball,3
What a shot! To a 150 kph ball.,2
Lockie: spray and inshallah,2
"Just an opinion, can CSK keep Watto, I'd miss the guy. 

I know they might keep only one of Faf or Watto. But he's been such a likeable bloke since 2016",10
"Low key, Ferguson has bowled a pretty mediocre over",5
Gaikwad and DDP scored the most runs in Syed Mushtaq Ali trophy. I think we judged Gaikwad too soon. He looks like a good lad. Get murli Vijay kinda feels from him.,5
And ppl were complaining why KKR doesn’t bowl Lockie in the PP,3
"Why is this Watto's last match, CSK has one more to go",3
Here comes indian adrian pimento,12
"Gaikwad is showing way too much spark, my eyes are starting to hurt now.",3
Every boundary Gaikwad hits makes MS Dhoni look that much more stupid,-1
Rinku singh's face is very assymterically symmetrical,4
Legit no way csk chase this,-3
"No one:


Cork: Gaykwar is on strike",5
L LAG GAYE :(,2

Damn I'm blind.,2
Gaikwad plays some lovely lofted shots down the ground,3
Holy BEAUTY there Gaikwad,5
That's a classic shot mate,5
This kid is elegant af,5
genius gaikwad,3
Fucking Jadhav played in place of this God,9
"Bhenchod, what a sparkling shot!",3
Jeez. That is pure text book from Gaikwad,7
What a shot!!!!!,4
"Need Wickets, Come Fast. Quick.",1
Gaikwad and Curran should open next match.,1
[removed],4
The sheer timing on that shot. Wow. Hope we get him back to the dugout soon urgh!,9
https://www.reddit.com/r/CricketShitpost/comments/jiih1p/excaptain/,1
Just one wicket and CSK will eventually be too much under the pump,3
That was a delightful shot.,9
Pls let ruturaj play from the beginning next season.,9
Kkr's strategy is beyond anyone's comprehension. Every front line bowler has at least bowled one over inside powerplay today,7
How the fuck it went to 85m?,7
"*chuckles* I'm in danger 

- KKR probably",9
All CSK players are likeable. Hate to see anyone go :(,17
If Kuldeep says that he wants to play for a team where he can get all matches which team can that be? Maybe SRH?,2
Somebody tell Curran Kolkata is the erstwhile capital of India and CsK is set,9
"Wow, that straight six by Ruturaj, written Sachin all over it.",12
Quite the contrast between Gaikwad shots vs his mouth movements lol,8
It is very rare to see players step out and hit sixes these days. That was a shot and a half.,13
Gaikwad had no trouble hitting boundaries against chahal and sundar and here he is playing well against varun.,13
"Can anyone take a hat trick?

Ranaji can you help us again please : (",1
"Earlier: IPL is a tournament where 7 teams compete to play finals against CSK.

Give Jadhav's money to ruturaj pls.,12

"Gaikwad cant just smash us out and dip, get to 50 quickly pls",7
"The spark has grown into a fire.

Gaikwad is poking a finger into the eyes of CSK selection now.",10
CSK have scored just 11 so far off singles. They can’t keep getting away with boundaries as powerplay is done. Something’s gotta give in the coming 2 overs,1
Shoutout to KKR to keep SRH hopes alive,4

Ugh Narine is such a run cork,1
Ruturaj is reading Narine better than any other experienced players in csk.,9
But Karthik baba MSD only told No Spark,4
Where's obligatory complaints against DK's chatter?,7
"I respect dhoni but he should be coming to bat after Jadeja, Rayudu, Curran and Santner imo.",5
Narine taking his cap back from Morgan's head looked funny lol,2
What's Narine bowling? Doesn't look very threatening. I think players are playing it safe against him because of his reputation,2
"If we get to a stage where we need around 100 of last ten overs with Narine bowled out , we might actually chase it down.",-2
Good start from CSK.,1
"I like how CSK is pacing the innings. 

Win this one for Kings XI :)",5
I respect Dhoni but he shouldn't come to bat at all,5
"With DK & Chakravarthy, KKR is more Chennai than Chennai themselves. Lol.",10
Meme that! Meme that!,1
Would've been quite the innings if dk was the wicket keeper and murali vijay was playing,9
Warner really fucked up Rabada's tournament economy in that game,4
DK and Varun are OG chennai boys.,1
"If one of Jaggi or Ruturaj can cement a mini-Hussey/Badri role, it'll go a long way in CSK's future balance. Freeing up a overseas opener slot to replace Bravo's death bowler slot.",2

Watson wasted so many balls and put pressure on ruturaj. Next game send Curran to open.,1
Bruh ashish is literally a astronomer he predicts future lol,5
That should be the end of Watson in IPL. He looked totally spent.,4
its gaikwads tongue v/s varun's stare!,7

I definitely see some spark in Gaikwad. But watson did not look comfortable and its good that he is gone.,2
Oh come on,3
Ffs Watto. Faf died for this shit,2
Rinku Ji ka swag dekha. Savage.,2
SRH fans: Adios,1
Narine and varun work very well together. Narine builds pressure so batsman targets varun and gets out.,1

This was a difficult catch made to look easy.,2
So nonchalantly taken. Good catch.,1
Swann being a sore loser. Lmao,3
Watto has a T10 league left of him. And that's about it....,1
Did Swann just make a wank joke lmao,8
VC and Narine will choke CSK if not for Gaikwad..,5
"Watson was great for last 2 seasons but this season he has absolutely been a match loser sadly.

Would have been much better him getting out first ball than knocks like this",8
"Btw, Rinku Singh is a terrific fielder; and has taken many blinders for KKR. He doesn't drop those. But if his fielding was required, he can easily come in as substitutes. His batting is very ordinary. KKR most likely doesn't want to waste 1 spot for a specialist fielder.

(I saw he is a part-time spin bowler too. So, will he bowl an over tonight?)",8
"Kkr fans got the watson innings they asked for

Srh are the only sufferers ig",11

I'm so glad Ruturaj has played back to back innings that are at worst decent now that he's batting in his preferred position,5
Sucking the life out of this chase.,8
CSK is likely to slow down considerably. KKR must use this phase as much as possible.,4
"One of my neighbors had a female dog who he named Juhi. A young boy was bit by her one day and he came to my friend shouting in Marathi :' Uncle mala Juhi Chawla, ball ghyayla gelo tar Juhi Chawla'",5

Can someone please hold Rayudu? I'm looking for 3D glasses. Can't see the technique without them,2
Why is DK loud and mad all d time ??,2

"Lmao Dominic Cork and Scott Styris were mocking how Ferguson was gonna bounce out Indian batsmen in the dugout commentary today.

Gaikwad is making them look like proper idiots.",14
"Yeah we lost. This was a good IPL lads, see you again in 5 months.",12

CSK fans saying Dhoni was right after Gaikwad failed a couple of innings ago: do you feel like idiots yet,12
DDP and Gaikwad opening for India one day.,8
Lmao imagine commenting that their youngsters have no spark when you play them in wrong positions.,12
Gaikwad is hitting sweet spot almost every delivery. That is what confidence does. I wish CSK had put more confidence on him earlier.,17
"No one's gonna say this, but that Rana over is the definition of Dream11 game changer of the match",12
Gaikwad's the the Spark™ that will blow into a flame that will burn down the ~~First Order~~ Mumbai Indians probably,4
"This match was so slow, even serial downvoter fell asleep and didn't do their thing, fortunately. Atleast things are picking up now",8
"David Hussey looks fine and fit for a man his age.

The way everyone is going on, you would think he looks like Boris Johnson.",9

Ruturaj will score a century and pee on Dhoni during live interview,11
Please bowl Rana again,12

Gaikwad targeting Ferguson and cutting the hype to size.,15
"Funny how we see someone play well for 2 games and writeoff Dhoni's statement. 

Almost as if MSD and Fleming don't see them train day in and out with them and happen to be one of the most experienced captains around.",-2

SPARK™,3
GaikGod,4
"Bhenchod, Gaikwad ki batting dekh ke dil garden-garden ho gaya. Amazing short arm cover drive with a smallish follow through and a nice short arm jab pull to match too. 

Really well made 50. Perfect platform for a 170 odd chase",8
Not a single dot ball in the last 21 balls.. Is this CSK??,27
"WICKETS, COME ONNNNNN",1
sparks sparks sparks,4
Well played RG ! Impressive.. good future csk player,6

"With all due respect to Gaikwad, if Gavaskar could he would even praise Gaikwad the way he pisses. Just shut up pls",5
Murali Vijay played 3 matches for CSK this season.,6
Gaikwad has some beautiful set of shots,9
KKR fans who were complaining about DK captaincy - y'all gonna complain about Eoin now?,8

awesome shot Rayudu garuuuuuu,3
Bahubali shot,3
What a fucking shot.,3
The dugout guys were saying earlier that Fleming is indispensable and should be retained as coach. Agree/disagree?,0
These two are setting up a good foundation so that Ngidi and Karn Sharma to finish it off in a blaze of glory.,2
Proper Rayudu shot from the MI days.,6
"Playoffs hopes are diminishing for KKR, with every run scored.",7

What did Scott say? Missed that bit,2
Santner can hit big.,4
Rayudugaru💦💦,4
It’s sparkling boys,3
I always thought Ruthuraj was Tamil.,6
Now we're gonna see Rayudu throw his good innings unnecessarily now.,3
"Dugout critiquing KKR bowling decisions after the timeout, and rightfully so.",9
Momentum is back!! Sparks are becoming fires.. Omg csk where were you 2 weeks ago,7
Only Thala can save KKR right now.,12
"When these two are hitting shots they look so good. Gaikwad is just a proper, beautiful to watch Batsman while I love watching Rayudu do his typical step out of the crease shots.",10
Honestly I am not impressed with Nagarkoti and Mavi for LOIs due to limited variations. Test is where they can shine.,3
DDP and gaikwad a will be the new rohit dhawan for india. Perfect left right combination.,3
Baz writing down notes and communicating with walkie-talkies must be the most comical sight this season,3
We want msd,1
Why tf are they bowling short balls???,2
CSK Grandpa is over the moon,11
Death taxes and Baz fucking up KKR leadership,11
"Rayudu & Raina have been such strong players for CSK, such a shame Rayudu performed poorly just before WC & got dropped",6
I hope they promote up Curran,6
where were you when kkr was kill? lol csk winning this,3
How come the bottom 3 teams winning everything now.,8
CSK: Can we have 10-12 matches more,12
"Dhoni should try to not bat today if he wants to win, no disrespect to him just stating facts",15
Damn if only CSK had given him a chance earlier in the season at the top and won two more games even it could have been some season.,7
CEAT ad is kinda creepy.,7
"I agree. If CSK continue this and work on their batting a little more, they could be lethal again next year.",6
Bowl rana one more over and seal the game,5
Csk: let's restart the tournament. We've gathered the sparks,16
Nagarpotty,7
"TIL Gaikwad is a common surname for leather tanners. He's certainly tanning some hides tonight, amirite?",-6
This is not a spark. This is a wildfire.,9
Turns out all CSK needed to win was the ✨spark✨ from the youngsters,3
In b4 Sextillion7thPower becomes a meme!,6
Atleast now we have sorted opening position for next season IPL.,2
"Everytime Rayudu or V. Shankar performs the other player gets the shit. Neither of them deserves it. Rayudu was a player let down by a lot for things - His own State Board, Laxman, Not getting chances while in the team and no backing during that 2019 period.

Shankar didn't do anything wrong to his place in the WC either. He was a player who could do a bit of this and bit of that and not enough of both. Wasn't his time to rush him in!",10
You can thank RCB for bringing CSK back to form.,9

Every shot Rayudu is playing makes me regret that we didn't have him as no 4 at the WC.,4

Bowl rana you cowards,7
Haven't watched a match for the 1st time this IPL. Is the game like the Scorecard shows? And why tf Tripathi down the order again?,3
"Come on csk, do it for kxip",9
Gayakwad is my Sextillion7thpower striker of this match,16
"Remember when Ruturaj stepped down the track first ball and got stumped? 

In hindsight, stepping down looks like his natural game and he should have got more chances",6
I guess BMac is more loyal to CSK than KKR.,11
I hope KKR is realizing that CSK is running away with this game.,6
Lol I just wanna jack off to Blake Blossom and go to bed but the sparks just won't let me go!,2
Csk strikes back,3
"That Rana over changed the momentum in favour of CSK, KKR overcomplicates everything and finds ways to mess up the situation",6
"KKR needs big changes in management , absolute cluster fuck of a decision to go for Rana and then Ferguson",6
Lmao why would you even check that,4
"If we release Watson, Jadhav, Vijay, Tahir(deserves a different team), and some others, we should have enuf purse to go big for the auction
Edit: Also Chawla lol I forgot about him",9
"In this season of hurt, Curran & Gaikwad are the only silver linings for this season",21
Getting Watson wicket was a huge mistake for KKR.,13
Dhoni has unironically may have made gaikwad's career right here.,21
CSK gonna win 2021 ipl with Gaikwad getting orange cap,18
Lmao why would you even check that,10
"Kishan, take notes

U don't have to cunt spinners for a six every over",16
Kkr does not deserve to be in the playoffs,9
Guys where is manvinder bisla,8
ZERO weakness against spin for Ruturaj.,18
is there a place where I can watch IPL without the background crowd noise they artificially include in the display? I want to hear the sweet sounds of bastmen stroking the ball well.,6
"Seek help, if Gaik-wood lasts longer than 10 overs.",13
did scott styris put his money on KKR or something lmao he mad,15
So who do y’all think CSK is retaining next season or whenever the mega auction is taking place,3

No heat for Mogran now??,11
Ready for Ambati Rayudu Apology Thread about the Unapology Thread of the Apology Thread?,11
"Well played Rayudu, good running.",7
Remember when Peterson was critiquing rayadu for not running well between the wickets with intent... look at him running today.. Wonder what changed.. whatever changed was for the better..,11
Gaikwad should be considered instead of Surya Kumar Yadav.,-6
"If Dhoni gets in now, CSK are losing. This is the tricky phase when they can't afford to lose steam.",3
Dhoni chose to lose matches and get out of any playoffs chances so that gaikwad gets to bat without pressure. He made gaikwad's career just as he did for Rohit. Thala thinks for team India. Thala respect. Thala god.,18
Kkr just take these two out of the game you guys have won it.,3
"If KKR fail to make the playoffs, does Morgan get any blame at all??",6
"KKR hai Tayyar!

>!ghar jaane ke liye!<",8
Looks like dk Just wants to go home . Prolly his last season for kkr. Then he has srh csk  and Punjab left before he can retire having played for 8 franchises .,3
5D move by Dhoni with that spark comment to ignite spark in youngsters,7
5D chess by Dhoni to inspire youngsters. What a mad lad!!!❤️,6
"Instead of playing that stupid Jadhav, CSK should have played Gaikwad from the inception, would had a much better result.",2
Which was the worst performance by a team in a season? Pune Warriors back in the day or DD few years back?,5
That was a pretty stupid field placement in the last over. The field is too open.,6
I am so mad that Dhoni & Mgmt thought Vijay and Jadhav deserved more games than Gaikwad and Jaggu!,12
"Get replacements for Watson, Chawla, Bravo, Bhajji, Jadhav and Raina? in the mini-auction and CSK will have a decent squad to make a comeback in 2021.",10
"I doubted Ruturaj because he looked absolutely clueless until the RCB match where he batted like a different man. And continues to do so. Humbled.

Best part, he hasn't been given a reprieve so far, still going unbeaten.",9
Ferguson had to choose only the game against SRH to perform.,17
"Fairly certain that CSK have sewn this one up.  
The decision to bat Rinku above Tripathi and give Rana an over both seem stupid now.  
Baz is a bad coach. His need to always try something funky is his BIG weakness.  
  
At the end of the day, I got 2 things from this match:-  
  
1) How the fuck did KKR get to 12 points in the first place? MIRACLE  
2) With every passing day Gaikwad makes Dhoni's ""spark"" diss sound more and more stupid",8
In a parallel universe Sextillion7thPower is RRs sponsor!,13
I'm supposed to be up for them here but man I hate this Chennai team,3
Can someone tell me the name of the girl on the Skore ad?,-3
That earth mover ad shows why Facebook needs to be finished for good .,5
The sound from Gaikwad's bat is orgasmic,3
"KKR, now I know how Republican supporters must've felt for last 4 years after every passing tweet.

You don't deserve the playoffs.",-2
Well KKR playing better under kartik than morgan tbh,4
So imagine Sextillion7thpower sponsering the six shot sponsor,5

Still remember how everyone was Dhoni was right with that comment when Rutu and Jagadeeshan got out on 0. Aged like milk,12

Dhoni dhoni . Come in get 4 off 12 and then finish on 26 off 25,4
Omg if Dhoni comes bye momentum,8
I think csk should exchange Raina with Williamson next season. It’s a difficult decision but a logical one.,0
Bois it's over.,8
Dhoni is walking in.,2
amazing innings,3
Oh no not Dhoni. Not Dhoni please,2
KKR might have half a chance if Thala walks in,5

Everybody expecting Curran / Jaddu. We are getting Jagadeesan or MS,2
"If CSK lose this, it's considered a choke",3
As far as I remember the players dont put their value for 15.5 crore it is the management of the team which decides that it is fine for buying him for that amount. If anything the management should be criticised not the player.,0
For 2 million dollars Cummins have looted King Khan the last time that happened was in Don 2 and it was all SRK's own plan 😞,2

And you all jinxed,3
Just a reminder that Thala batted well with Sparky last match,3
BC cricbuzz chutiyas are so fucking irritating in CSK matches,4

Rayudu I was going to sleep early man. Now this match will go till the 20th over.,2
Brain dead captaincy right here man,2
Hope today is the day Dhoni finally scores a 4 against Narine .,2
Ballsy from MS not sending Curran instead. Respect.,5

Will they release Cummo and buy him again at a lower price?,6
Controversial opinion but I believe CSK would fare better had Dhoni not been the captain,6
"so that CSK fan was blowing whistle, I was thinking why I kept hearing faint whistle every now and then",3
Only Dhoni can win this for KKR now,6
Big mistake not sending Curran. Csk will most definitely lose if Dhoni plays 10+ balls,2
"Please Thala, help us.",5
Dhoni has come early because he is sure CSK will win this,9
Narine vs Dhoni,1
Here is me hoping that Dhoni doesn't tuk tuk and hoard the crease from wining this match.,2

"It's Kohli's fault Gaikwad wasn't selected for Aus tour.

"Kedhar gone from team Jagga in

That is Dhoni's 200th run this IPL,4
"Dhoni walks in at a tough time of chase: Please, not Dhoni! Tuk tuk is here.



Dhoni walks in close to a win: He comes in now only to improve his avg.",13
Guys thala came in so people won't be blinded by the joint spark of Jaggu and gaikwad,9
Now watch Dhoni put too much pressure on Sparky and then they choke from this very winnable position,2
Jagadeesan could have come in the last match atleast. No pressure situation and a good time to give a chance to him. But wasted by MS as expected.,3
"Dhoni: ***Run rate is too high, I must do something now.***",6
Cummins is apt for movie roles. A few exchanges with SRK and Preity and he'll get a cameo role in some cheesy Bollywood flick.,6
Dhoni is the only one who can win the match for KKR now. Please don't let me down Thala!,6
Gaikwad is gonna have to be the aggressor,1
62-1 in the last 5 overs. Very uncharacteristic.,1
You guys think gaikwad can get to his century?,1
I came here looking for spark but i found gold,3
[deleted],8
"Step 1 : KKR Release Cummins

Step 2 : Cummins unsold in 2021 Auctions

Step 3 : Coulter Nile “injured”. Cummins called in as replacement by MI

Step 4 : MI field an attack of Boult, Bumrah and Cummins.😈",15
Gaikwad with a clinical single. Must have the main batsman on strike.,1
I can't back this up with either humour or stats... but fuck you Pat Cummins,6
Lol can’t believe my eyes so many CSK supporters upset about Dhoni coming in to bat,7
This is right up dhonis alley. 6 overs 53 he ll take it to 20 off last over but this time around won’t finish it,2
Dhoni to make this an even contest.,8
[deleted],11
Feel bad for jagadeesan. He should've been sent now. Relatively easy situation and dhoni comes in eh,4
Now both the spinners are gonna comeon and choke Dhoni.,4
"Dhoni in the crease, KKR now back in the game as long as they do not get him out early",3
"This is an important partnership right here. If Dhoni can make an occasional boundary and just rotate strike to Gaikwad who can play more aggressive, CSK should see this one out.",1
"With KKR losing today, DC fans can finally chill a bit.

The only way DC are getting knockout now is if they lose to both - RCB and MI

And SRH win against RCB and MI. SRH have a superior NRR

KKR won't be a worry for DC as DC have a far superior NRR",0
20 needed off last 2 overs. KKR should save Cummings and Fergurson over.,3
I feel like KKRs jersey should be brighter. It looks so dull.,1
Cmon Big D give us some sixes,1
Thala has come out to extinguish the spark.,3
Dhoni gonna please another Thala super fan by getting out to him.,2
"MSD gonna score big today vs terrible fast bowling so that his fans can bang on every available plate in the vicinity for a Thala Party.  
Gonna use the goodwill to coast to another season as captain while he rakes in more endorsements.",3
Absolutely mematic if Thala hits Narine for a 6 today,7
Dhoni tonk it now.,3
Hope CSK don't choke like last time,1
Haha Dhoni to make KKR win,1
This is the over which decides the game.,0
HERE WE GO BOIS,2
Tuk tuk started.,2
Tuk tuk starts....,5
Feel sorry for N Jagdessan... Been in the team for 2 years hasn't got a chance to play and when he finally does CSK batting line up starts doing a RCB,2
53 from 36 with 8 wickets in hand but the fans are still worried bcoz of the one and only Thala.,4
Dhoni might electrocute himself batting together with the spark.,6
"Don't do that Dhoni , don't give me hope",8
"Good God way to suck the momentum, even Fleming thinks so",1
"Guys, I too have MS Paint. I think I will paint CSK orange and share as analysis",4
Visible distress on Fleming's face,7
Banger indirectly spitting facts.,7
How is he picking out fielders with such precision,4
Dugout trying to manufacture stats out of that one boundary dhoni scored in the last game off a short ball,6
Dhoni is like to momentum what a black hole is like to light,4
CSK needs to improve their NRR inorder to not end up in the last position.,3
"MS ""Bat Deep"" Dhoni",1
"Should have been Sam Curren, knowing they have another over of Narine left. Thalia can’t play spin.",0
When I see batsmen play spinners without helmet I remember vj shankar getting clanged on the helmet while running . That would be sure death without a helmet .,6
Next over Narine please,1
Mofo won't stop playing dots. Screw you cunt.,2
Tuk tuk here we go,1
Thala for KKR rescue.,2
"Am I the only one, or does Gaikwad look like Dinesh Chandimal?",0
YAAASSSSSS,2
Rutu has become Virat,2
"CSK cruising....


Dhoni: No, we need to take this deep, let me walk in.",1
Wow,1

"Dhoni, if you can hear r/cricket..imagine its sri lanka infront of ya in 2011 and swing the damn bat",2

BigDaddy D💦 gone. Second time by Varun. Bravo,0
KKR just made a huge mistake.,2
Thanks God. Good for csk,0
"Dhoni plays dot ball

r/cricket- I feel my heart crack",2
I'm tensed af don't play dot bowl's,2
I felt bad for Dhoni.,6
This is just sad,3
"Goneeeee, sr <100 won

Who would've thought",6
What in the hell...,4
"I think it's more painful supporting KKR than supporting CSK this time. At least CSK fans had no hope, KKR fans have all the false hope to contend with, and then the team destroys its own fans' hope.",3
:(((((((,3
KKR fans :Ye nahi karna tha,11
Wrong wicket,2
THANK GOD,2
"Maybe Sam should have been sent in. 

Varun has an over and Narine another. 

He hasn't been the greatest against spin for a while now.",3
Damn that ball was something,2
You've just lost the game for your team son,9
Woah Jaggi playing!,2
Yov thala,0
This wicket has done more good for csk,8
Okay KKR loses now.,12
"Thank god, even CSK fans should be happy",10
What a ball by Varun. 107 kmph oof. CSK right back in it now,10
FUCK YEAH,1
2 in 2 for varun.....,2
Haha lol,1
Bruh,1
Dam KKR y'all messed up by bowling out Dhoni.,18
"Trying to work out if this is hilarious or tragic

Probably both tbh",2
Thala in 2020-Thala form,9
This is good for CSK lmao,7
Oh shit kkr fucked up : (,9
when will Gavaskar stop sucking Dhoni's dick?,7
"Oh no...

Anyway..",12
Dhoni is really clueless to Chakravarthy's bowling.,11
Fuck. We move on. This guy is clueless.,8
Wtf,6
Now lets start winning the match again,14
What a Delivery that was! Ball of this IPL definitely.,10
Thalaaaaa,3
loda GONE,1
"NO VARUN.  
With Dhoni's departure, KKR's last hope of winning the game just ended",16
Dhoni bringing KKR back in the match!,3
CSK don’t fuck this up please,5
WOW Dhoni... WOW,3
Mr.Dhoni where is YOUR Spark???,9
SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT,6

Oh no. KKR is going to lose now.,6
Bruh moment,3
Chakavarty won't get ms t-shirt now :(,8
Thank you kkr,5
[deleted],8
"Dhoni relies only on 6-7 players , mainly international players to win him matches all the time. The remaining 4-5 are just fillers. This plot was working until this season.
Had he invested in Indian youngsters like Gaekwad from 2 seasons ago , they would have matured enough to turn into matchwinners by now.",7
Good for CSK.,4
"Varun doesn't celebrate Dhoni's wicket, that's some respect.",11
"Yess!! 

Curran in!!",8
"There he goes

KKR fucked now their only beacon of hope is gone now",18
I never thought I would say this.. but thank god he is out,7
Hahahahahaha.,1
CSK fans are happy with the wicket. How the turntables,6
Varun got dhoni's wicket 2 nd time this season,5
Blessing in disguise for CSK,9
"I know people are going to shit on Dhoni now but that was just Ana amazing delivery, 9/10 batsman would've gotten out.",2
Ah shit here we go again...,3
Noooooooo!!!!,3
Good... Ended before he wasted 2 more overs.,2
"Thank god, he's gone",1
Flemming looks like that grumpy uncle at Thanksgiving lunch arguing about politics,3
107 kmph lol wtf,3
wtf,2
Kkr really shouldn't have taken that wicket!!,4
Curran and Gaikwad 😍😍😍😍,3
Sad...,1
Kkr you guys have ruined it for yourself here.,4
"Can anybody explain why Thala has to adjust his gloves like...... after every ball? Also, it's over for KKR now.",4
"**14.4** Varun to Dhoni, OUT,  **121-3**

MS Dhoni  b Varun 1 (4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 25.00",1
Oh noooooooo,2
"People asking why Varun is given chance

Varun- because this!",4
Chakra will tell his grandkids how he bowled MSbigD twice,6
khudme spark toh hai nahi,6
Varun Chakravarthy just brought the game back in CSKs favour,6
"At least he didn't waste too many balls. Having said that, WTF Dhoni forgot how to play spin.",5
Ofcourse MSD plays his best innings against KKR,7
Varun what are you doing?! Now KKR is going to lose!,2
Dhoni looks absolutely fuming,2
Varun Chakravarthy won the match for CSK,6
KKR misplayed here,4
embarrassing!,1
"No Varun, what have you done? Lost the game.",14
"So, Jagadeesan is the specialist fielder..",5
Alright let’s get the momentum back now,1
Yesssss!,1
Dhoni really gave him a death stare before leaving lol,12
Sad to see MS like this.,5
Selfless innings from Thala. He got out to let the team win.,6
He's gets bowled to Chakravarthy second time this season,6
Advantage CSK,6
Dhobi gone. Advantage CSK,1
KKR should have let him bat. Now we have Sam fucking Curren coming out.,2
Dhoni single-handedly brought KKR into the match.,3
Fuck sake Dhoni absolute clown,3
"Thaala. 🍽️

Bati. 🍵

Glass. 🥛",2
Dhoni Gone. CSK back in the game.,9
Chakravarty got the wrong batsman...,2
Better that its the 4th ball. Atleast there is time for the next batsman to settle.,1
Chutti Kuzhandhai!!,5
Match looks like it's going to towards final over... Maybe a repeat of the last match both teams met,2
Sunny G hyping up Dhoni & he's bowled next ball. Peak bias,17
That was a really good ball,6
"As a CSK supporter, this is a good thing . Else Dhoni will surely waste 2 overs .",8
Oh! MS out! Finally the match would be over before the last over,13
Thala needs to find his own spark first,17
"Varun got Dhoni both the times!!!

Get this guy on the plane for the Australian Tour..... Oh, wait.",11
THANK YOU VARUN. LET'S GOOOOOO CHENAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII!,4
"As someone who supports KKR in this match,I don't know whether to feel happy or sad about Dhoni getting out",5
Naughty Gavaskar successfully jinxed Dhoni there.,1
Thank you Dhoni very cool,2
Varun bowing faster than Pollard,6
How will KKR win now?,3
"KKR fucked it up.

When Dhoni is there just let him play his tuk tuk and win your match. 

Relegate dhoni to lower order",6
Dhoni should come in only after the spinners are done bowling their quota,2
KKR wish they had Jadhav to rescue them,2
Dhoni out means CSK will win lmao,3
"Good news for CSK, Dhoni gone without wasting too many balls.",1
Ngidi clapping when Dhoni walks back to dressing room after 1(4) all you haters can't digest this ❤️,7
Peak 2020 CSK,3

Sunny G always hypes Dhoni before Dhoni shits the bed.,3
Thanks Dhoni for consuming only 4 balls.,3
"Watson, Steyn and MSS have just been a shadow of their former self this IPL",4
spark and the fire batting together!,2
Dhoni tf was that,2
"Dhoni’s technique was always wonky. Now that his batting reflexes have waned as well, I guess it’s a deadly combo.",6
There's lack of pinch hitter like Pandya and ABD in CSK line up... Things could take a wierd turn,4
"I am taking my mind back to 2004 when we saw Dhoni with his mane, genial smile and smacking bowlers around like we have never seen before then. That's how I would like to remember him. 

Unfortunately, the problem begins, when people only think of that and keep tolerating this done and dusted version (since 2016 for India imo)",9
This little maneuver may cost KKR the match,10
[deleted],4
"Man proposes ,Thala disposes",1
I miss scooter,2
Varun is a mole in KKR ^/s,4
What's with Dhoni and Kohli struggling against spin?,5
One over of Narine should be the difficult part. 50 of last 5 should still be in favor of CSK,2
Blessing in disguise for CSK tbh,11
Ah fuck,5
Dropped the match?,6
Sam baba has come,1
Dropped the cup™,6
"At this point calling it Commentators curse is also funny.

Because every time SunnyG praises dhoni he fails instantly.",7
"Morgan be like I saved Narine over for MSD, and then he ruins all my plans!",3
"Has Varun dropped the match?

Big drop",5
Congrats to those who betted on Dhoni having a less than 100 sr lmao,8
Top over,1
"DK and Varun talking in Kannada?

Edit: thanks, it's Tamil. I am a kid trying to learn how to distinguish among all the 4 south Indian languages, got confused on this. No offence meant to any language here btw.",-4
"I want dhoni to play at least one good match :( 
It’s sad to see the cricketer I grew up watching  shit on so much ( even though most of the criticism is warranted )",10
KKR - Not sure if we should be celebrating Dhoni's wicket or be pissed because tuk tuk phase is gone,5
Varun looked distressed after taking Thala's wicket,3
O wow....csk trying super hard to lose right not,3
oops. is that the match right there?!,2
Chakravarthy to hire 4 bodyguards and stay at that CSK painted house for his own safety when he gets back to Tamil Nadu.,12
"Dhoni has a set mechanical formula. He'll not lose the wicket to certain bowlers. Doesnt matter even if he doesnt score of them, but generally he'll score at 3/4



He'll target certain 1 or 2 bowlers and score 14/16 off them. Problem is he is not able to get his target bowlers away and is also getting out to the good bowlers.


TL;DR: Dhoni has expired.",14
If they get Sam Curran out. THEN THE MATCH IS GOING TO BE LEPT TOWARDS KKR,6
Feel bad for Dhoni,5
Dropped the match there mate,8
That dhoni smile.,5
Csk pls,3
Damn this guy is goooood!,3

How can something be 'healthy se bhi zyada healthy'? Lol.,9

Narine wicketless after coming back. Surely they can try banton or tim seifret to make batting stronger.,1
"Sooo Rana over was kinda unnecessary, eh?",9
4s in the gap between 2 fielders in the deep are so beautiful,3
Earlier Sunny said all bowlers are good off their own bowling and Karthik did the unthinkable and disagreed. I hate to think how smug he is now.,3

Gaikwad needs to be drafted in in place of Rohit in ODI's and T20's tbh.,-1
Sam Curran chews gum like an Aussie,6
Lucky,1
Jadeja is csk best striker this season...pity he gets less than 30 balls in most games ..,3
Sam curran is massively overrated. Fight me.,-10
This has been the only thread without constant trolling from fans of all other teams 😌,11
Grew up watching vintage Dhoni smashing the shit out of bowlers....but for the rest of my life I'm gonna remember more of his failures than his success sed life,4
This next match is like watching my two children at war,9
Sam Is looking chilled af,8
"Guys, Will we have a mini auction for IPL 2021?",3
They're going to do it. They have wickets on hand and are power hitters. Bring it home boys!!,5
"It's a no brainer, ball Cummins and Lockie and hope for less than 15-17 runs in those two combined. And give Nagarkoti cushion of 15 runs in the final over",9
If Dhoni is  Thala is Jhadhav the Vaalu?,5
"Koach should drop Rohit and Dhawan as Dhoni did with Dravid, Ganguly in 2008.",-12
"Stage set for Kamlesh Nagarkoti.

Come on boi, fuck em up",9
Can definitely see CSK fucking it up from here,7
i missed Rayudus innings. 39 of 20? wow,9
Tight as a duck's arsehole but i trust in sam curran,8
At this point everyone should know Dhoni is simply in the team for Marketing and PR reasons,16
Tomorrows match is gonna be exciting!!,2
"Damn, Morgan's looking for blood with Cummins in now",2
Fucking this makes me respect Tom Brady even more. dude dominating a physically more intense sport like nfl at 43.,1
"Gaikwad scores 2 back to back half centuries

CSK fans :- Gaikwad can be next Hussey Gaikwad can be next Raina",1
Win or lose just glad to see Gaikwad play well. Hopeful for next year.,10
"https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/jk158d/reddit_prediction_will_dhoni_score_at_more_than/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

So did you lost or won and if won then how much?",2
Please CSK don’t screw this up,8
"If KKR lose, are they out of contention?",5
I dont have any confidence on RR tomorrow. Tyagi and Rajpoot will get smashed all round the park.,7
Dhoni lowkey pulled a jadhav but no one noticed,6
It is better for KKR not to take any wickets now. Curran is good with spin only. Jadeja is a danger man for KKR.,3
"Come on Curran, cut this chase",3
Wtf was that throw Cummins??,8
Wtf throw was that,7
Nice throw Pat,6
Factory shot smh,5
"*ngl, Varun Chakravarthy will be the architect of KKR's victory if they manage to get these 2 points*",6
Throw wild af,4
Wtf was that shot LOL,5
The fuck was that Curran,1
When Tendulkar retired he was not peak Tendulkar but still performing. He had some value for sure.,6
Biggest over of Nagarkoti's career so far.,3
Can't rule out the utter shit fielding from kkr,5
[deleted],-7
Cummo! 11- anything would be good. Lesgo,7
Might have just slogged the ball right into the fucking stumps,9
Cummins and Nagerkoti now,3
Thanks Pat,1
"Sad that Jaggi hasn't been able to show his Spark.

Hopefully he and Gaikwad will open next match/ The last one",6
Want KAMLESS to get in and give us JYADA-MORE runs lmao,1
Curran trying too much... Just maintain your balance and hit through the line as opposed to dancing on the pitch,3
"mfs really found a way to lose this, didnt they",20
Dhoni didn’t see a spark in Gaikwad. And he sees himself in mirror every fucking day.,14
Is this the match,8
Fucked. You are fucked csk .,6
we were rooting for you CSK. we were all rooting for you,12
There's the match guys.,3
One shot too many Rutu,3
"No need for that Ruturaj

You were batting so well ffs",9
YESSSS CUMMINS FINAALLYYY,5
Ooooooofffffff.,2
Time to stop watching,6
Lol why would you play that shot man,7
Oh no no no no,6
"why tf are they playing this cutesy shit, they're not Mr.360",9
Just get jadeja and match is set,2
Fuck this,3
Santner and Jadeja can still tonk,2
[deleted],3
Gaikwad plz never again play uncanny shots if u can perfectly hit traditional ones,17
"Cummo is now a death bowler , things you see in 2020",11
15 cr working now,6
"Hayden, Hussey, Bmac, Watto, Faf... Who is the next great about to retire/retired international going to be picked by CSK next?",3
Who were those two chicks!,0

Pain,1
"With Ferguson to support him, Pat is 5x better now",4
CSK bottling after losing their top 3... Tell me something new,3
Damn! KKR back in serious contention for playoffs,2
"**17.2** Cummins to Gaikwad, OUT, **splits middle and off stump!** **140-4**

RD Gaikwad  b Cummins 72 (53b 6x4 2x6) SR: 135.84",1
"Why tf are both of them trying to hit it behind? Just play like you've been playing till now ffs.

Fantastic innings from Gaikwad though.",3
We're winning this.,0
Oh fuck.,1
Misbah ul Haqed,2
Not bowling the yorker worked for cummin😂,1
Went for factory shot.. wtf is factory shot BTW?,3
"Come on KKR, be a good sport for once in your fucking life. It's for the greater good.",-1
Ooof all on the currant now,1
Jaddu gonna win it?,3
"Ok guys,  time to play for NRR.",1
I love how terrible the disconnect is between the TV director and the commentators. They're literally never ready for any of the graphics / Altroz / whatever they decide to focus on,3
"lmao only CSK and SRH could toss this away. A salty part of me want to say this is fixed, but it’s probably just brainless cricket from CSK",6
"Rituraj does a Misbah ...
Misbah - atleast i connected ..",8
Showed lots of spark if you ask me,4
"Pls CSK win this, don't let KKR come in our spot",5
Script writers want kkr to win.,3
"Gaikwad no, it's patty Cummins not another bowler, you can't do that to him",2
"Gaikwad still a great find for CSK, incredible batting",3
SIR,1
"Jaggu will come in and win it


Right?",5
Fast forward to 2021 Ashes- Curran would be playing this shot against Test match Cummins as well.,3
2 times they've bottled the chase against kkr after getting a very good start,5
"~~So if KKR win today, one of RCB/Delhi are confirmed qualified.~~",3
Fudgebuckets :(,2
Who comes up with those puns over the big board? Been seeing them since forever.,3
"Pat yourself Cummins.!

My dirty mind...

Cum yourself Pat!",30
Is Jadhav playing today?,1
KXIP fans sadder than CSK fans right now.,8
Why are ads becoming worse as the tournament goes on?,3
Sunny G screaming about *FACTORY SHOT* somewhere rn,3
"'Pat yourself Cummins' is the worst of those stupid scoreboard puns yet

Absolutely shocking",14
LOL! CSK Why you no play lika this against RCB!!!!,8
Has any single player managed to go from universally liked to detested like dhoni has?,1
Im scared of Jadeja. Please don't fuck this up KKR!,1
The name puns range from terrible to meh,2
"You still have jaddu, can turn the match around either way lmao",1
Chennai is rightfully at the last place,3
Dude Mark Nicholas is literally doing commentary straight outta Circket 07. This is great stuff lol!,6
whatever the result its just an year to forget for CSK.,2
Come'on CSK...,2
Commentators forgetting there's a certain Jagadeeshan in the dugout.,5
Please retire Dhoni. We don't want to remember you like this,1
Another bottle job!! SMH!,1
"Dhoni after the match: As I’ve said, our youngsters need to back themselves to finish matches. Lack of SPARKY",5
"Yo, Curran and Jadeja, now is the perfect time to prove your mettle and show your SPARK",2
[deleted],14
Cummins returning what KKR paid him,3
"Jadeja ne kabhi India ke liye finish nahi kiya game, CSK ke liye kya Ghanta karega!!",5
Lack of experience from Gaikwad,8
CSK already choked their first game against KKR looks like they'll do it again,10
10 coins ka nuksan hogaya Dhoni ke chalte :(,3
CSK: Spark is dead and everything is worse now.,10
CSK trying to do a typical CSK 2020 chase?,4
Can still win it let’s go CSK,7
I don't see them winning it from here.,3
"Cmv: India won't win another world cup until Shastri goes back to the comms box.

Iconic commentary in both the 2011 world cup final and the 2007 T20 world cup final",8
[deleted],8
That was Cummins 8th wicket this season... Only cost KKR  1.92 crore for that wicket,10
Lockie needs to bowl next over. Need to get wickets.,1
[deleted],2
Cummo has bowled an absolute brilliant over here,4
"The one time CSK could actually be a useful fucking team, they bottle a piss take chase. Thanks for absolutely nothing, CSK",9
I'd still say fergi for 19th and plan will be to nail 145+ yorkers,7
Dead inside rn,5
Pat yourself cummins smh,2
"Playing lap shots when you are set? Hit straight FFS. Good fifty, Batted for 18 overs, still left the team in a pickle.",6
Dhoni's 1(4) shifted all momentum to kkr,18
Toink a 6 pls,2
Gaikwad should've stuck with the elegant cricketing shots that've served him so well  this innings. Good knock nonetheless,5
Six now and they are back in!,6
This is why CSK needs Dhoni. Fuck this shit.,-3
Best Cummins over this season?,9
Jadeja only has one 50 in IPL.....,2
Rituraj Back sweeping at a 150 kmph bowl KEK,3
Kkr have been heist specialist this season ...is another win from jaws of defeat on the cards here ??,3
"long off and long on are covered, why even attempt that shot",3
Will Nagarkoti bowl now???!!,2
Yeah that's what we get for rooting for CSK.,6
Spark Extinguisher did his part.,6
Come on Jaddu pls,2
This over was just too good,7
What is to be said about CSK that hasn't been said before. At least they listened to criticism and made changes this time. Tough game.,6
FFS CSKKKK,2
4D chess not to let MI qualify with this win by CSK,9
"Teams to CSK

KXIP: You have my sword

RR: And you have my bow

SRH: AND MY AXE",7
Damnnnn.... Tight over from pat.,7
My Reddit coinsss (ب_ب),2
Cummins actually bowling good death overs lol,7
Million dollar over right there,7
This is actually sad,5
Great over by Cumdog,4
"Meanwhile Jagdeeshan and Santner:

Ha yeh karlo pehle.",4
Some really good bowling from KKR in the last couple of overs,3
"Cummins...

**Italian chef kiss**",2
I think this twist in the game is credits to KKR not CSK. They always manage to turn a losing game their way.,3
"30 in 2 overs...

CSK frustrating fans of RR, KXIP, SRH. Prime 2020; or any other year really, but for different reasons.",2
Lol csk feked up now,3
No one can bottle it better than us,3
"Gotta bowl Lokie for the 19th, but with KKR, you never really know.",3
15 cr over,6
This is seriously good bowling,3
Good luck getting 10+ runs of Ferguson's over.,3
Common CSK don't fuck us all,4
That Sam Charan Teja always plays well against us. He gotta imagine that hes playing against MI.,2
CSK bowled very badly in the death,3
Kkr got this,2
"Jadeja went from being the only guy in the team with lack of intent (T20 WC) to being the only one with intent (WC SF, IPL 2020)",3
Watching other teams depending on the outcome of this game is more exciting than CSK winning.,4
Surely lockie bowls now,1
"CSK to the rest of us: hum toh doobe hai sanam tujhe bhi leke doobenge

T: we’ve already drowned, and we’re taking you with us",3
Cummins repaying 15crs,5
Pat Cummins wants to be retained at same price.,6
"hahaha, funny to see all other fans getting pissed off at CSK.",7
"Right now, KXIP fans would be more worried than the kkr fans. We anyways don't have much hope from our team.",4
They're still in it. 1 six and 1 four and they're back in it.,3
"The only day I wanted CSK to win, of course they never would have.",6
"KXIP v RR tomorrow

Whose win benefits SRH?",4
Wtf lockie,6
Ferguson and nagarkoti and we need 30 of  last two overs. Looks like this is another choke in the making,6
"We’re just letting you know the results of your prediction, and unfortunately your prediction didn’t come true. Your prediction of 10 Coins has been distributed to all prediction winners. Play again soon!",3
Why isn't Michael Holding part of any IPL commentary panel... BCCI sure can offord them...,2
"If you're a KKR fan, you should say all those big monies on Patty paid off.",3
"Sam's gonna pull this off.

(And if he doesn't, I will. Fnaar-fnaarr.)",4
Lmao ofcourse CSK fucked up the chase. It’s all over. 95-5 KKR,3
Need a blinder over from Jadeja,2
Just 5 sixes needed :),7
"Commentators blaming Curran and absolutely absolving Dhoni of the shit show he has been all season.
Thats whats called sucking up.",5
Need minimum 20 for nagarkoti,1
Today I have felt what other CSK supporters have felt all season.,5
"Offtopic But is the Oppo ad guy, Robin from Mirzapur?",4
"Even if KKR win today, if they lose their next match they will still likely be out",3
impossible for csk to win this,1
"Please CSK, please don't let Kings XI down :(",9
Show me a better combo than CSK and choking. I am waiting,6
I still feel csk are gonna win this somehow,2
*CSK not letting MI qualify. Lmao the old cherished rivalry*,12
CSK dont wanna win because MI will get the Q today /s,10
"Wtf is ""tikha"" Fielder",4
"barring Kamlesh's over, i think KKR got this in the bag.",5
Jaddu mama dont screw up,5
Curran went from 22(7) to 9\*(9) in 2 months time. Learnt from the best.,24
Is Lockie a one match wonder?,2
Come on CSK. Win for Punjab.,4
That Cummins over might be worth at least 50 lakhs,11
"I am not really happy as to how much people here are giving attention to a certain former WI player. Considering that he’s plugging in his brand every post, he’s just using Logan Paul school of marketing himself. 

I wish posts about him(whatever it may be) stop for now.",7
Fleming’s expression: how could we lose yet again!!,7
"The Script: CSK will get real close and then lose. Raising and the crashing the hopes of other teams,,,",9
Has 29 off 12 been chased before? (Unadkat and ABD is one example),3
28 off 11.,2
"CSK wins and the next match becomes must win for RR
KKR wins and it becomes an virtual eliminator between RR and KXIP",3
How did they bottle this? God this team really deserves the wooden spoon this season,7
"If kkr wins this, I would say the price tag on Pat was a bit worth it",1
"Highest individual scores by uncapped players for CSK:


72 - RUTURAJ GAIKWAD vs KKR, Today

65* - Ruturaj Gaikwad vs RCB, last game

64 - S Badrinath vs KXIP in 2008

64 - Srikkanth Anirudha vs KKR in 2011",6
Cmon 2 sixes by Jaddu and it *should* be over,3
Lol how have CSK fucked this,3
"Common kkr, do it for me. We can't let kxip through",2
21 for the last over,1
Good death bowling this.,3
Everyone except KKR want CSK to win lol. Please come through,3
Literally no audience in the stadium and yet camera person regurlarly manages to spot pretty chicks in the stadium. That is sheer art.,9
Guys do the teams get any money for qualifying like the teams do in PL ?,1
Great bowling lesgoo,2
We need new signings. Need to replace 7-8 players.,3
Come on Sam that's a full toss,3
How did CSK manage to fuck up such a comfortable equation? This is some September KXIP level of fuck up,7
"Not even good bowling, just fucking completely brain dead batting",9
Rank full toss wtf,1
CHOKE,3
Why are they trying new shots :(,4
"r/Cricket: Dhoni should get out so that CSK win this

*Dhoni gets out and CSK lose the plot*

r/Cricket: Surprised Pikachu face but still gonna hate on Dhoni next match.",9
Jadeja Asking for 2 XD,2
23 for 2 in overs 15-18. CSK going to make the KKR management look like geniuses yet again,5
"dot!

28 off 10.",3
Goti muh meh moments,2
"Anyway, I would like CSK to lose it will make the playoffs even more interesting!",1
This is some good death bowling,2
Wonder why the fuck I even logged in. Stop bottling every fucking chase CSK,7
"Fucking Pat Cummins, Fuck yeah!",6
"In Lauki, I trust.",5
/SIGH,1
"Failed attempt number 4

How many more till they realise it ain't working today.?",3
PLAY STRAIGHT FFS,6
Obligatory shot of Fleming looking depressed..,12
Sam Curran turning from a hero to a villian real quick here,7
Chahar eating apple is mood,2
"15/17 off Nagarkoti in final over is doable, anything above that is done for CSK",3
2 of their best pinch hitters and this is what they do?????,4
What is the conversion % of a ramp? It's literally one of the most poorly executed shot among players,3
Wait and see how Curran is blamed for this. Meanwhile a casual 1 off 3 will be pardoned for not wasting any deliveries,5
wow bhenchod wtf,3
CSK has been attrocious hasn't it?,4
Dot. Dot. Dot. Dot........,2
CSK: Choke Sab Karenge,4
Bruh what is this trying to be cute fuckery. You don’t even have to slog it just try and play normal cricketing shots.,3
Yeah this is done,6
Why everyone's Misbah now???,3
Juhi channeling her inner Durga lol,3
This is the kind of battling you'd expect after you are down 8 wickets.,3
CSK's been successful at killing confident boy Sam!,7
"man I really thought CSK had this, maybe theres still time",4
Juhi Chawla praying,1
Wtf is Curran doing,5
Fleming wanting to kill Thala.,5
CSK have managed to turn Curran into tuk tuk,3
KKR's death bowling is saving them. Well bowled,2
Sam Curran 10(11) with a tribute to finisher Thala,4
Yup guys we fucked it up.,7
"after such a good start, the lower order is choking a dick here",3
"27 in 9!

Need a six every second ball :P",3
Who is bowling last over?,3
CSK messing with the entire points table now. Lol,3
How to blame Dhoni today?,5
"Ah Yes when they bowl a ball that can be smacked for six you try a ramp, when they bowl a yorker you just stay there",3
Feeling bad for Gaikwad. All his effort are going down the river...,1
Is RR out now?,2
lol.. even Rana bowling last over won't help CSK win now.,2
jaddu pls,3
Curran also ran out of fucks to give lol,3
Hope today you all got the pain and suffering of csk fans.,3
Fleming is going to bang Thala tonight. Careful Dhoni.,4
This is KKR's game to win now. These are a lot of runs to get on a fairly big ground.,5
"If kkr wins this, does srh still have a chance?",6
"Who bowls the last over? Nagarkoti? You think these guys can get 20 against him? 

Would feel really bad for the youngster if  that happened, my heart doesnt know what to choose",2
That was a bad ball!!,3
"this bowling has been choking the attack tho, hats off",3
it's not the battle between two world cup winning captains ffs. It's the battle between MICHAEL AND DAVID HUSSEY 🤩,2
SCurran...don't end it like this please,3
"Can’t expect CSK to get anything done, we’ll have to absolutely win tomorrow for some chance to qualify",1
lmao.. neither of the 2 batsmen batting at SR of 100.,3
KKR somehow manages to clinch the final moments and CSK is the other way round,3
Both kolkata and csk have done this before,1
KKR is the luckiest team of the IPL. Everything going their way without putting a good fight,3
"If we lose it from here, we deserve that fucking wooden spoon.",1
WE NEED 6'S AND 4'S PLEASE,2
KKR is a boring team,0
When Sam Curran came to CSK he had hoped to learn from Dhoni. And today he has shown that he learned well,6
"You either retire a hero, or stay long enough to see yourself become the villain",2
"If only youngster showed spark, csk would have won this match easily/s",0
"What a shit ball, come on lockie",1
23 off 8.,2
Curean finally embracing the csk way,3
Jadeja adjusting his cojones after spanking one to four. Chad.,2
Morgans captaincy won .KKR the game,-1
I need a superover,4
6 from these 2 and you have yourself a match,6

"Waiting for Shane Watson debrief tomorrow: They played very well. We tried our best. We had no answer. Yada Yada... 
Anyway YouTube is his primary job now.",2

Super over pls 🥺,6
Lockie brought kkr back into ipl and it is but poetic that lockie is the reason kkr is knocked out,1
"Superover, yup.",3
Can’t believe we lost this,2
[deleted],1
Jadeja remembered last year's WC semi match against NZ.,4
No way Nagarkoti wins this 🤔,2
normies have started the it is fix jokes,7
"Dear Scriptwriter,

Another super over please. Its been a minute.

Sincerely, r/cricket",6
Watch Curran try to hit it behind wicket and get out.,5
Rahul Dravid ain’t made for advertisement.,2
The difference between Jadeja and Hardik is that that full toss by Lockie would have gone for 6.,5
"Good bye guys, that's the playoff chances smashed🖐️",2
At this point I would rather call back Gambhir to lead the team again.. because we are just going back to our original form from the early years of IPL,3
Turn tables! Turn tables! Please turn tables,1
CSK shortening their fans life expectancy with these kinda close matches lmao,6
Super over please,1

Hope Nagarkoti is coming down with some lube,1
Dhoni is low-key the Bheeshma pitamah of CSK,1
Jaddu the batsman has finally arrived. 12 years later. Warne must be delighted.,3
Lockie Ferguson? More like Lauki Farzi Insaan,2
"A Bowler with economy under 6 goes for 54, Peak IPL",6
Haha haha dinda academy Ferguson. Ain't I hella funny peeps,6
Curran just has to play his usual shots instead of trying to scoop everything and it will be easy peasy,2
Curran ffs,3
That last over by Lungi Ngidi for CSK was clutch. Let's see what Nagarkoti does now.,3
9 runs of 1 ball was the difference,5
Here we goo... last over.,3
In the case for lockie lightning does not strike twice.,4
Sam *thala* Curran,6
"There's a RCB choke where you play well in a chase  but end up losing shit ton wicket at the end and lose the game

Then there's csk choke.. Keep a shit on wickets in hand and end up keeping a shit ton of wickets in hand only to lose the game",5
Cmon Nkoti,0
Get Jaddu on strike!!,3
Ferguson remember how you destroyed SRH last time..How does it taste now,6
Ferguson did his worst,1
"dot to start!

10 off 5.",2
"Oof Lockie 0-54 in 4 overs.

That's 1/3 of their runs in 1/5 of the match.",5
Sam curran ne harwa diya aaj,2
We need the prime nagarkoti please,1
"A Youngster left with just 10 to defend in the last over.

Very criminal.

 Thanks lockie",4
bc curran,1
Gotta feel for Nagarkoti,2
Sam pls,1
Curran removes his mask to reveal it was finisher Dhoni all along,3
Jadeja is making up all through his career for the deep wound from that horror show in Sachin 175 match v Aus,4
Let's see what you got Nagarkoti,1
bc Curran just hit and run,1
Those dead eyes,1
anyone know the name of the oppo ad song?,1
"CSK helping other teams in qualifying, this is the reason CSK is high on fair play award ranking.",7
This has all the makings of a match that will lead to a superover.,6
Give Jadeja strike man,2
Jhaant ka furguson,3
Cmon kamlessss,2
Oh man Curran please,3
GIVE JADDU THE MF STRIKE,2
Dk in spain,1
Jadeja loves his vegetables.,2
Hope curran gives him strike,1
"If Nagarkoti even takes this to superover, I will be shocked",2
"You're being listened to whether you want it or not. Is that unsettling, or reassuring?",0
This would be the worst character arc for Sam curran,12
when did hussey turn into boman irani?,4
Jadeja: Single le,8
"If I release a sextape, I would like Sangga to commentate it",8
Come on this is CSK's bread and butter. 8 in 4,4
gote in mouth status: ✅,3
Curran nearly pulled off a Jordan there!,1
Thought KKR would defend 20 runs in final over. Let Curran take two runs.,1
Aaj Dhoni ka CURRANT nahi chal paa raha,1
We just need to 2 boundaries. Make it happen!!,3
Nagarkoti to nail a maiden over and confuse everyone,1
Nagarkoti ki goti mu mein hain,2
Six pls Sammy boi,1
19.2 two runs. 8 off 4 needed.,1
I have 0 hope,1
Super over??,2
Someone tell Curran to run in a straight line.,6
Now this is a classic CSK chase.,2
I just noticed CSK has six wickets in hand. And they are still struggling to get to 173?,3
"tf they ran double for, give Jaddu the strike and finish it",2
Lol Sam went soo wide in that 2nd run,1
Another super over incoming,1
Curran running on third pitch lmao,3
Curran doing the Chris Jordan style run but making it into the crease,5

Aur banao isko cutie curran,5
Someone stop the whistling ffs,12
Thala wasted 4 crucial balls as usual,9
Such a huge responsibility on young Nagarkoti! Damn!,2
Damn Zuhi and Preity haven't aged a day,2
"I want CSK to win, but I really enjoy seeing Sam Curran struggle, he has troubled us Indians enough",2
Superover anyone 🤡🤡,3
Daddy love young boy..,2
"DK just thanking his stars that he is not the captain anymore!

Man, how he would have been crucified if he were the captain now for the 16 run Nitish rana over!!",10

Not today for Curran.,3
The eyes of nagarkoti are filled..,5
"Sam Curran really became Dhoni this year, he is imitating the latter half of Dhoni's career now as the season is coming to an end.",5
"Credit to nagarkoti

3 good balls to start",6
7 off 3!,6
CSK to fill their customary super over quota today?,7
"Bruh I've seen this script often, 7 from 3, there is a dot, a four and a 2 run",7
Juhi Chawla's prayers is the 12th man of KKR,2
Didn't know the S in S Curran stands for Shit,3
bhenchod tie karna hai kya,3
Curran is simply not confident enough at the death - batting or bowling. I hope he works on that.,1
Gentle Reminder- Nagarkoti not bowling full quota cos Rana bowled an over conceding 16 runs.,3
"CSK are out, but still shitting myself.",1
"Jaddu will hit a six now

Edit : bruh no

Edit 2 : bruh yes",1
Curran or Kedar? Who is this guy,2
Idiot Curran. Opening up when he knows bowler is bowling wide.,2
CSK ki haar ka curran Sam hai.,5

Lord curran twist ya spine and hit,1
Fucccckkkk,1
Wow,1
What is up with whistling? Why can't someone from the stadium staff stop it,2
If Nagarkoti  defends this then he has spark otherwise he is gonna go the Varun Aaron way.,2
"7 off 3!

Superover is quite within CSK's grasp. If they can't even get to superover, they might not make the playoffs I think.",1
S U P E R O V E R,1
Fucking hell,1
No matter which format India plays Jadeja is must!,1

Fucking anti climax,1
Some terrible batting in the 19th over lmao. Cannot have dot balls and singles bruh ....,2
This has been a superb over so far,2
Right call,3
This match essentially decides the whole ipl qualifying scenario,3
Top bowling from Nagarkoti. Gotta remember that this is his first IPL,5
"If KKR loses this, it was just because one bowler had a bad day. I think that is fine",4
Fucking hell man,4
Another dot and then six,3
Nagarkoti bowling the over of his IPL career right now.,3
7 off 2!,5

"This one's for you, kxip",4
Sir Jadeja puts Axar back into the box with this innings,8
Kkr never deserved the playoff spot. Mediocre in every sense of the word,10
CSK gonna win next year IPL hype thread fuck y'all I can't wait,3
What an absolute madlad. Incredible clutch performance.,2
What a Chad lad...,3
Hey we qualified !!! The last two balls are beyond me. Couldn't bowl yorkers?,5
Thanks Jaddu,2

"Mi qualified....I should be happy

Syd :(",4
Fuck yeah Jaddu!!!,5
KXIP and RR thank you Jadeja.,5
absolute chad,3
Get fucking innnn!,6
Jadeja the batsman has always been massively underrated,6
It's the hope that kills the KKR fan,3
Csk are the kind of men that wanna watch the world burn for fun...,16
Thank you Sir Jadeja,5
Ferguson fucked that up. 20 runs of the 19th over,15
Nagarkoti should have had way more runs to work with. Not his fault. Ferguson had a shocker tonight.,14
Hard luck KKR.  Jaddu was on fire. GG CSK.,5
This brings our campaign to an end.,1
Jadeja the new Thala!!,10
Everyone praise Lord Lauki for this win,6
Jaddu just shredded KKR in bits & pieces,8
"Bring this fucking form onto next year guys! 

The master chasers are back",12
Damn I kinda feel bad for Nagarkoti :/,4
"Thanks CSK, Appreciate the gesture.",8
Why is he pointing towards India Cements?,16
"Feel for Nagarkoti, 10 was never going to be enough. They lost that game in the 19th over.",17
Santner with those utra-hipsters glasses.,6
"Thank you Jaddu. 

- sincerely a RCB fan.",17
"I love you CSK bro absolutely epic, didn’t disappoint like DC did",14
Jadeja for mayor of Chennai,15
How fucked are KKR chances to playoffs?,7
Nooooooooooo 😭😭😭😭😭😭,5
Lmfao KKR walo bahar aajao,4
"CSK have helped MI qualify.

Let the memes begin.",18
"Dhoni's last horcrux, Sir Ravi J",21
"By hitting a six when 1 was needed, has Jadeja damaged KKR's NRR just that tiny bit more?",13
"Finally, a Classic CSK game!",7
Why is Jaddu shilling for India Cements now?,10
Bruh Lockie you fucked up on Poor Nagarkoti :'(,7
We have got the Q. Thanks CSK.,8
Thanks Jadeja,7
THANKYOU  THANKYOU  THANKYOU,9
Jadeja has definitely been the most important batsman this year for CSK,9
Ferguson cost the match,4
Only KXIP can beat this CSK lol,8
"This is how we used to win before, that too with Jadeja hitting like this.",8
csk please do the same against kxip,7
Fuck yes,5
I feel bad for Juhi Chawla,9
Why is Jadeja signalling to the India Cements sign? Is that a signal to fixing?,13
Weird way to advertise India cements,11
Nice work csk. feels for kkr tho,3
I’M SO HAPPY RIGHT NOW NO FUCKING WORDS,5
Sir Jadeja wins a match when fans of 6 teams needed them to,31
Always nice to see lungi happy . Such a wholesome smile .,12
I just lost 30 reddit coins,7
'India Cements' remember the name,19
"Rooting for King XI to make it to playoff. Will be fine if either RCB or Kings win.

Jeet ke aao Kings XI!",18
"Apparently, none of kkr's bowlers can bowl Yorkers.",10
CSK never thought id root for y'all but here I am <3,23
Good guy Jadeja putting over Indian Cements,20
Lockie Ferguson from super over hero to zero,6
If r/cricket ever again questions Jadeja selection ever again I’m gonna go off.,18
Jadeja is underrated as a clutch player,10
god jaddu,4
MI qualified on an even test without drama. Yay?,10
So is Jadeja > Stokes and Curran?,11
"Thank you Jaddu

*Srh fan",8
"Man Jaddu, such a unit",10
"So, RR n Hyderabad, both are in run for playoffs then?",9
DC : Live to die another day,13
"So MI loss knocked out CSK
Now CSK win has made MI qualify for playoffs.",15

"Whatta guy! 

Jadeja never looks like he'll play such innings but he'll make sure you  eat your words back if you've shat on him.",17
Won entirely because of Sammy <3,-3
Watson and Dhoni pls handover your match fees to Jadeja.  Thanks,27
"What a player!!! Fucking clutch!!!

Do your thing with the swords Jaddu!",9
"Everyone should thank Ferguson for that No Ball, that made KKR lose the match that they were handed to win",30
Csk classic finishes are back,9
That second last six was such an insane shot,22
"Jaddu loves his India Cements. All kidding aside, that was legendary.",35
Get fucked SRK,10
I miss seeing the CSK dugout so happy,24
"Welp, we are not making playoffs anymore. Congrats kxip on your playoff spot. Idk how you can be one of the best cricket players in the world and yet making decisions worse than the knob heads of r/Cricket",14
Thanks jadeja very cool,19
"Okay, altho it feels like there's some breathing room for KXIP. the bad thing is we will have to play against a better CSK lol",17
The fact that csk had the team to play much much better but just didnt field them saddens me,26
Yaaay my 10 coin bet on CSK paid dividends. MI qualify too. 🤩,9
What batting by Jadeja,8
"Morgan with mandatory ""20 runs short "" speech

Edit: I was wrong the runs on the board were good enough.  Sorry.",21
People still think Jadeja isn't a good T20 bat. His stats this season do not lie; avg. of 46.40 @ 171.85 SR.,22
Was Jadeja picked for the India Squad?,8
"Thank god . This didn’t go the previous CSK KKR way .

DK > Morgan .",9
"Good stuff CSK, just lose to us pls",12
"Where is Nehra ji now,....aur dalo length ball ...lol",10
"The only time in my life I wanted CSK to win (to better my team's chances), and my man Jaddu came though!",20
CSK saving KXIP & RR's ass. NEVER FORGET,11
Lmao Jadeja pointing to India Cements on the back of his shirt instead of his name is hilarious,49
**INDIA CEMENTS FOR THE WIN.**,19
"Lol, can't believe csk wom today.",3
Don’t forget nagarkoti.  Kid nearly saved the runs.,17
Man,1
MAD LAD JADDU,6
"""Suryakumar is better finisher than Jadeja""",6
Congratulations to SRH RR and KXIP,13
Genuine Q tho. How did the free hit happen? Did lockie throw a no ball and walk past the line?,6
[deleted],-16
"That No-Ball cost KKR the match... Before that, CSK was done and duster. Crazy how a single ball changes the match",19
"Fuck Yes..
Sending love to CSK from Mumbai..",11
"Thanks csk, very cool - MI fans.",9
Somebody should be suggesting Nagarkoti to change the length after bowling 4 similar deliveries,4
All because Ferguson bowled a no ball. The guy who saved KKR's season ultimately cost them a playoff spot. Simply KKR things.,29
"Jadeja giveth 17, Jadeja taketh 15 !!",17
"Since every captain except Iyer and Kohli are spared for their poor choices. Take Morgan's case This would have been KKR's game had they not decided to bowl Rana instead of Nagarkoti. Rana over went for 16 and changed momentum. KKR finds ways to put themselves in a bad situation, have themselves only to blame",22
Absolute scenes if RR wins tomorrow,9
Guys is kkr out of the tournament?,5
"Man, I really wished if Dhoni finished like that. The memories and excitement. Will always miss that dude.",19
next match csk vs KXIP 😈,7
I dedicate this win to India Cements,27
"actually CSK is doing better since their last two matches, makes me worried that they'll beat KXIP too lol",9
CSK always wins when I don't check r/cricket during the match,9
Who will CSK retain if the major auction happens next year? I think only Jaddu and Curran,8
Are fireworks real or cgi?,6
Jadeja is a better batsmen than bowler in white ball cricket imo,13
"CSK : Hum toh doobe hain sanam,,,",9
"Ok Jadeja, I will go and buy a sack of Indian Cement for you for keeping SRH's hopes alive",48
CSK could have been in playoffs had Jadeja come ahead of Dhoni.,27
You are the champions CSK. Made sure that we all stay alive.,22
Jadaja found a right moment to advertise India cements,23
Jadeja telling everyone that inside part of his bat is made up of India Cements. Ban him!,14
"Now KXIP has to make sure they make most of this gift from CSK!

Can't believe commentators and everyone was gunning so much for Morgan to be made captain and now no more words.",17
"Ravi Jadeja is way, way under-discussed when it comes to coolest cricketers. Lad is pure box-office.",14
"Thank you CSK. Sincerely, all of us.",11
Jadeja has been criminally under utilised as a batsman. Even for India.,11
These last over finishes really get the heart pumping.,5
Thank you CSK💛💛.,8
Gavaskar was all praises for Ferguson the other day. Oh how the turn tables.,5
"Thank you KKR, very cool",6
Dhoni took this tournament deep by disqualifying themselves then going on a winning streak.,12
If only he had finished like this in 2019 semis 😔😔😔😔😔,11
So tomorrow if RR loses they get knocked out?,9

Finally the 5 team 16 points drama is over,15
That one match when Cummins delivers....,12
Someone make that swole doge Vs cheems meme with Ferguson against CSK and Ferguson against SRH.,9
JADEJA YOU BEAUTY REMEMBER THE NAMEEEEEE,6
"This takes mew back to MI vs KTK in 2011. I saw Sachin score a 100 live only for Mahela, Mcculum and Jadeja to make a mockery of the target. Jadeja ended with back to back sixes in that match as well.",9
Bye Bye KKR. I cant seem them catching up to KXIP in NRR. So they need them to lose both their games. I cant see that happening.,11
"Do you guys feel the language barrier in between an Indian bowler and a foriegn captain sometimes works for the opposition... Like there seeemed like Morgan and Nagar koti weren't having huge conversations.. Had it been dk things would have been different..
Only because of the language????",7
Jadeja is my Sextillion7thpower striker of the match for sure!,41
Punjab had horrible luck in the first half and now everything is happening according to their plan.,8
"Ravi Jadeja, take a fucking bow",13
Striker of the match : India Cements,17
Now all we need is KXIP to lose tomorrow. Then we can fight for our own spot with that superior NRR.,5
"Ferguson the giveth , ferguson the taketh",21
So does this win help us in anyway?,6
"And to think, he was called “bits and pieces”. Mans a firecracker.",12
"We might even have made into playoffs if Gaikwad wasn’t hit with covid right at the start of the tournament. Sparks ? He has more lightning than sparks lol

Seriously what a talent . Faf and Gaikwad next IPL gonna be lit",28
"Karthik with big brain plays, drops captaincy, starts by batting well and he isn't blamed for the losses now",18
I hope Punjab goes in and then wins the final. That will be the return gift they can give csk,24
Pupils finally learned to take it deep,2
The only time r/cricket will celebrate a csk win. Just drink it in while it lasts fellow csk fans.,29
Well played csk but still dhoni is a choker.,0
"Damn I was rooting for KKR, was wishing somehow to dislodge one of the top 3 out of playoffs. Oh well, extraordinary from Jaddu 🔥",5
"FUCK KKR, Jadeja is so clutch. Come on Kings XI, it's in your hands now you've got this",11
I take back everything r/cricket said about you CSK. But srsly Jadeja what a guy!,17
Jadeja's batting has seriously improved over the last 2 years.,11
"That moment when Chennai win makes Mumbai happy. 

And Punjab have a chance to reach #2 tomorrow",11
"The dugout guys are spot on. 

Jadeja HAS to be played as Indian teams finisher now. He was the only spark in that shit ass WC match that never happened.",34
Peak CSK performance. Rollercoster finish.,10
Why does Morgan have such a sorry look on him?,5
Sir Jadeja's batting skills are underrated or I will say highly unutilized ! What a player !,15
"Morgan learning from Thala with his ""pitch got slightly easier in the second inning""",9
Jadeja take a bow!,3
Man what a turnaround this was. Swanny was predicting 80:20 in favour of KKR in the 17th over.,7
"Looks like this is KXIP's season. They have got everything, and now looks like going to qualify.",7
Today it's all about the Indian young players.,7
Dhoni shaking kkr players hands and consoling them that they are not the only team they will knockout.,12
How hard is it to not give 20 in an over Lockie ffs that’s above 3 a ball,16
I missed this types of win from csk,14
Jadeja finishes it in style.,6
So is KKR out?,2
It's been a while since I've felt this euphoric,9
What's the equation between Kohli and Jadeja?,6
CSK - we r out but we r not going to go down easily. We will take some other teams along with the ride,15
Preity Zinta laughs maniacally. Win tomorrow and it's only SRH that can stop them,10
"I wanted more drama in the points table but jadeja ruined it 

Well I guess kxio and mumbai can qualify now",4
The death of Dhoni saved CSK.,17
KKR lost the game when they got Dhoni's wicket.,25
"Love you CSK lol, thanks for helping.",13

KXIP HYPE!,3
"KXIP - we give our fans mini heart attacks almost every game by taking that shit to the final over.

CSK - *standing with a Dhoni jersey* - you merely adopted it, we were born in it.",49
Jaddu boi you just gave me 8 precious reddit coins. Made ma day honestly,20
Never this happy for a CSK win.. thank you Jaddu,12
Someone tell Jadeja India cements is written up and jaddu is written down,21
CSK weren't only playing for pride. They were playing for 7th spot. My money is still on KKR to finish last.,16
"Fuck me, get a Hindi interviewer for Jadeja. He'll he able to express his thoughts better!",14
Jadeja's voice always surprises me,14
"Jadeja should go down as one of India's better Limited Overs match winners. His bowling, fielding, and batting has brought India and his domestic teams out of the shitter more than once. He's just so clutch and fearless. Cometh the hour cometh the man. The moment is always made for Jadeja.",63
Thank you CSK.,10
Always feels good to see KKR lose. Always. No matter what the situation is.,21
Had bet 100 reddit coins on CSK wins on poll here. Won 183!,17
[deleted],-39
Why jaddu moves so much,6
"KKR should have let Dhoni stay on crease a while longer, he would have made sure CSK would never come close to target.",14

"CSK win helped nearly every other team directly or indirectly except KKR !
Well Played Bois 

Sir Jadeja you are breathtaking!",28
This win for CSK is like a nasty comeback you think in a shower a day after you are insulted,36
"Being happy for CSK is a weird but good feeling, honestly.",24
"Do you feel like you've lost the ability to feel emotions? Do you want those feelings back in your life? Just become a KKR fan, all you will feel is disappointment.",13
Jaddu reppin India Cements.,11
SRH next matches are against?,5
[deleted],7
Why do I even keep supporting KKR? Dunno the last time they had a satisfactory performance and made me feel proud of supporting them. It's just pain and tears supporting them. Loyalty is such a bitch. Even if they keep sucking as much still I'd keep supporting them. Man,5
"Looks like this time even the bottom placed teams will have 6 wins against them, I think it’s rare!",9
Jadeja has been a beast with the bat this season anybody talked about that?,24
[deleted],-22
Atleast got a glimpse of the old csk once this season,20
Dhoni made sure he didn't lose the match by getting out early,21
That's Sir Jadeja for y'all,9
Why do I even support this team anymore. Gemphir pls forget your BJP nonsense and come back.,29
Now i want rcb to lose against dc and srh for the memes,7
"KKR's loss makes this interesting, if RR win tomorrow, 3 teams would have 12 points, very tense situation. But of course if KXIP win, they qualify, no doubt about it.",7
"KXIP has won all matches after Gayle was bought in.

CSK has won both matches after Dhoni's spark comment.",16
"So, what does this leave KKR with? I am sure it depends on other matches or r they out?",4
"Morgan kinda messed up to be honest. In these situations gotta take your time, communicate with the bowler, tell him to bowl a bit fuller. As a captain of KKR, he hasn't impressed which is a shame considering he's captain of the best white ball country in the world.",15
"All teams except KKR supporting CSK : 
_APES TOGETHER STRONG_",55
Man feel so good for Rutu. Hope he becomes a CSK staple.,20
Morgan defending and backing Nagarkoti. So lovely,32
"About Nagarkoti, this is a good learning experience for him. He bowled a great over until the last 2 balls. 

Lockie, I'll give him a pass cause he won us the SRH game.",16
"India Cements,, remember the name",42
I think DC will shit the bed and two former bottom teams will qualify alongside Mi and RCB,8
Jaddu heroics means nobody is talking about Curran masterclass 13\*(14) lol.,19
Sir Jadeja.... the original meme cricketer,5
[deleted],7
Hopefully RR beat KXIP tomorrow so the table becomes even more congested,10
"*In 2018 at Chepauk, Jadeja hit a massive six against KKR to win it for CSK, the match where Russell hit 11 sixes*",14
"Ravi Jadeja you da man, him finishing games like this could be a massive boost to India's under-powered hitting abilities at the death.",20
Team India must utilize Sir Jadeja's batting skills!,19
"If KXIP loose tomorrow and SRH win, they straight up move to 4th place.",15
Unpopular opinion : Morgan and Rohit are not exceptional Captains. They have great teams.,18

"What I've learnt over the last fortnight of watching the IPL,

If you are facing a team at the bottom of the table, you will lose. No matter how good you are.",19
I had almost forgotten what successful run chases looked like,31
Why don't they talk in Hindi when the players are clearly not comfortable in English?,13
Jadeja jas worked on his power hitting. This is amazing for india,23
Jadeja reminded me of me trying to scratch my back,23
Your captain is as good as your team is,16
Why is no one bowling short to jadeja....,5
"Thank you CSK!! - Sincerely, RR, Kxip and SRH 🙏",23
Vintage CSK. Hope they come back stronger,18
KKR have made so many poor decisions. You could turn over the job to a random number generator and it wouldn't do any worse.,15

Are Jadeja and Kohli great friends? /s,11
Who are Kohli's favorites in the Indian team and who does he hate?,6
"As far as I remember almost all of the last few matches have gone in RCB's favour, except of course the ones RCB played",20
[deleted],-14
KKR really missed Jadhav,20
The fuck did this guy do to be the game changer,7
Jaddu had lauki ka bharta for lunch.,9
This is the CSK we know,16
To whatever happened to Juhi Chawla's prayers.,17
"Well, this is the end of our campaign and honestly, this KKR team doesn't deserve to be in the playoffs. Out of the 6 wins we've had so far, one was from a super over and two were because our opponents (KXIP and CSK) shat the bed. We've only had 3 convincing wins.

It's been extremely frustrating following KKR this season, and I honestly don't understand some of the decisions made by the management. It eerily reminds of the 2009 season.

For instance, why would you field a team of only 5 batsmen against KXIP? We were 10/3 and our tail started at 4 down. It was painful to watch. 

And what was the thought process behind that 84/8? Honestly, I would have taken 60 all out if they'd shown a little more intent over that shitshow.

Today, why did you have to screw with the batting order again? We could have got another 10-15 runs easily. And why would you bowl Nitish Rana right after the timeout? CSK were under pressure and they rightly tore him apart. Regardless of how Locke bowled tonight, I think that was the turning point.

I know I'm just ranting now but it's been really frustrating.",40
Dhoni just had a facial,6
This means MI are guaranteed a play-off spot. Only 4 teams can get to 16 points now.,6
"Calculators out for KKR now :(
Jadeja has given sleepless night to KKR :(",14

Thala finally sees the spark :),14
Dream XI game changer should go to Varun Chakravarthy for getting Dhoni out before he could have wasted more balls and won the game for KKR,36
Rituraj GaiCOVID ~By MS 😂,15
"I think CSK can contend next year with a few changes. Firstly, I love Dhoni. But he has to realize that he isnt the great finisher that he was before. Should have promoted Sam Curran ahead of him as Curran has a strike rate in excess of 200 against spinners. And, get an explosive opener at the top to complement Gaikwad.",23
Dhoni is the only player who gets criticized for his knock in a winning cause,14
"CSK wins

Darth Thala: NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!",12

"Saying that the guy had Covid so they couldn't watch him in the nets is a horrible justification. What was the point of having that camp in India that almost put the whole tournament in jeopardy then? Besides, it's not like Gaikwad is an unknown name unearthed by a local scout. He is an established India A player and was the second highest run scorer in the SMA Trophy. If the people on this sub have watched enough of him to vouch for him as an opener, then how come the CSK management, the ones who are actually paid to do this job, were cluesless about his potential?",39

"As far as I remember almost all of the last few matches have gone in RCB's favour, except of course the ones RCB played",43
I am waiting to see who from KKR will take the Thala's Jersey. My bet is on Varun with an outside chance for Rana.,16
"Morgan era has been way worse than DK era in terms of simple decision making. Can't remember ever seeing such bad captaincy, probably even Captain Kohli is better in IPL. Morgan doesn't know how to use the bowlers properly.",5
Do you know what the worst part is? KKR can go to the last position too now :'(,1
KXIP BETTER WIN TOMORROW'S GAME !!!,5
Reminder that teams are so shit that Delhi can still make the playoffs.,11

And so the aging Lion brings down the Knight with him.....,4
"Punjab vs rr for 4th place now, they might even take rcb or dc position",3
"For KKR to qualify.

Scenario 1: KXIP loses against CSK, KKR wins against RR.

Scenario 2: DC/RCB lose both their games heavily (preferably DC). KKR's NRR woes will be less.

Note: SRH has to lose at least one of their match, they pose high danger.",1
