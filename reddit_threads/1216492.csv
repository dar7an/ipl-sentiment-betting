1. When Pant got out trying to slog in the 2019 WC semi final, all the commentators were castigating him saying what a dumb choice it was. KP was the only one to say that he would be praised and called brave had that shot come off. KP mentioned that it was poor execution, not necessarily bad shot selection.

2. In this game, QdK tried to ramp one shot in the powerplay and Gavaskar was heaping praise on him saying how clever the choice was. KP said that it was too risky given the match situation and the fact that there was already a man there.

3. Curran was bowling full early in the powerplay and got hit for a four. Again, Gavaskar called it a loose delivery but KP said that there was nothing wrong in bowling full to get an early wicket.

And no, I don't have machops with a gun on my head who made me write this.",11

CSK is classic example of a team greater than sum of its parts. I still think they need one more good batsman and not sure Vijay merits a place. But bowling looked good today.",28

2020-09-20T04:09:00+00:00,Jay9dec,"The game was with MI......but it was their poor fielding and bumrah's bad luck that lead to defeat....163 was quite defendable according me....Also when there was a chance of taking wickets due to pressure of first two wickets drop, team gave extra runs.",12

2020-09-20T19:20:11+00:00,meh-wholl,"I think in all, I won't be too worried with the loss for MI. They have the right temperament and the solid lineup. With some trial and error, they will get back in their winning stride. It was an off day when no one particular person fired. MI is a young, talented, and well led and managed team.",1
