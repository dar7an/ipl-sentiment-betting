"Here we go!!!

How are the Dhoni Fan boys doing ?,3
Feel like one those obsessed fans waiting outside a venue hours and hours before anything starts.,7
"lads, I have fully recovered from covid-19, just in time for IPL",215

"Oh my God match thread already 2 hours before kickoff!!!

Anyway, this has positively been the worst 6 months of my life yet and I'm really really happy that I finally have something nice to watch on the TV after work. And I hope everyone's doing alright in these days (even you CSK fans). We'll get through this time too and lastly, thank you IPL. 

I love you MI!! I know we're not going to win this time but I'm still glad to be watching this season. All the best to everyone and may we all have a fantastic 2 months ahead of us. Cheers!!",6
Where is the stream? It's my first time watching sorry,3
Oh I'm so early lol,1
FLAIR UP BOISS!,3

Fuck yeahhhh get in shitposters,3
"Ah shit, here we go again.",1
IPL just isnt the same without Mayanti😔,6
Where's Mayanti??,5
All 5 MI supporters on this sub have marked their presence on this thread already.,4
They really are trying to sell Dhoni here. Calling him Lion again and again is suoer cringe.,8
I must ask once again - Why does the match bot have a Lancashire flair,3
"**My XI for Mumbai**

De Kock (OS)

Rohit

Is dugout commentary available on Sky UK peeps ?,3

"Rohit Sharma expects reverse swing to play a part this season. Thoughts? 

Umesh Yadav and Dale Steyn will be particularly devastating if they can get reverse.",0
Wanna see Rohit score some today,1
what’s the start time in IST,2
Where is Mayanti? No IPL without Mayanti?,3
My body is ready. Inject me some IPL-juice!,3
Hello everyone. Hope you are all doing well. Excited for today's gameeeeee,4
Could anyone here give a summary of what the two teams are like?,3
Any insect enthusiasts here?,5
"First time watching IPL, bumrah and hazlewood are my favourite bowlers so not sure which team to support for this match, but i dont have a team for the tournament either. I do support england, the ultimate banter team, so any similar teams in IPL?",2

"MI vs CSK in last 3 years

1st batting average : 138

1st batting win percent : 44.4%

Highest score chased : 166",4
Good luck to Mumbai and Chennai. ESCN,4
Who's gonna pick more wickets today? pacers or spinners? Any predictions?,4
The last time MI won an opening match was in 2012.,11
Lol the downvoter is already on fire. Hope you are ok mate.,6
BTW a 21 year old intern took care of me in covid facility. Thanks to her I am sitting at my home on cozy sofa watching IPL. She is probably still working hard in facility.,12
"Hazlewood should play, pitch looks green. Would go for both Hazlewood and Ngidi.",7
"Ah, the downvoter. The last bastion of a once-respectable society, back from robbing graves and cradles. We welcome you.",4
"fucking hell, I cannot watch the match with xtreme subscription lmao",6
Once again immigrants taking Indians jobs. #BHARXIT #JUSTICEFORMAYANTI,40
"I'll be honest in saying I've never been particularly excited about the IPL at all, largely due to the length of the thing and just not finding any emotional investment like I do with Surrey and the Blast. I'll watch the England boys occasionally and that'll be it.

That being said, I hope the folk that do enjoy it have fun and it has the shits and giggles you'd expect from it all.",14
I'm a nuetral so I hope both teams lose and get points deducted with multiple suspensions.,38
I think this is going to be a low-scoring game.,3
Welcome all to the new season of Karma Farming ! Gosh we missed cricket didn't we,88
"Looks like this could be our weakest year but that's what I thought at the start of the last 2 seasons as well, so what do I know",7
"Last time I was so hype for the IPL was 2013,the pepsi IPL where brett lee took the first wicket.",25
"I’m new to Cricket and am a bit confused, why aren’t England playing in this I thought they were in every match?",15
The stadium doesn't have any barrier outside of led boards and only the players are allowed to go and collect the ball if it goes into the stands or outside the stadium. So there could be some gully cricket level seens.,6
Literally the two teams I hate the most are starting the tournament but I will enjoy it in these trying times.,2
All these promos show exactly what's wrong with Indian celebrity culture.,15
AAHHHHHH some eyebleach watching Thala live on TV,5
Zaheer has gained a lot of weight. Ravi Shashtri has a competition in the middle.,4
"Can they please stop with this ""return of dhoni"" bs?",-5

Neutral supporter today. Excited to watch MSD on the field 😍,9
6 months I have waited for THIS  LIVE SHITPOSTING THREAD!,31
Why does the bot support Lancashire?,8
Chawla looks like he took silicon injections,8
Can’t wait for Dhoni peforming well in the tournament and then delusional fans wondering why did he even retire when he has been finished for so long.,2
[removed],7
"NCB should investigate the drug called MSD, it is spreading like wild-fire today.",2
Old man Watto broken out of cryogenics to go around again eh?,2
Match Bot = Lan**CASH**ire = Ambani = MI buying umpires. Checkmate atheists. Flawless logic ftw,11
Chennai Supper Kings lol,1
"If Raina left the UAE because he was afraid of catching COVID in the biobubble, why is he meeting multiple politicians and policemen while inaugurating a cricket tournament in a nation that's clearly a lot more affected by COVID?",6
Ahhh i missed these match threads,3
Oh no Slats,1
Helloo boys,1
chawla looks like he had extra chawal this season.,10
It's annual shitposting season!,14
Q: Who do we support in a match where we want both the teams to lose? A: Rain    Conundrum: There's no rain in a desert.,3
I missed these threads. Good to be back lads,8
"Just wanted to let everyone know that today my mom who doesn't know that it's CSK vs MI match today, asked whether she should make Idli Sambhar or Vada Paav today for dinner. 

My family voted for Idli Sambhar.",19

MSD can crush my self with his one arm,2
Gavaskar with some hot takes there.,1
"More than anything else, I've missed Dhoni's wicketkeeping the most.",4
Good old days are back,2
Why the fuck aren't the commentators not wearing any masks?,2
"Bring on the MI bought all the umpires sledges. I don't care as long as we winning. 
Also, I miss it.",3
wth Gavaskar smoking. Dhoni is nowhere even close to Sachin. People lose their minds regardless of where Sachin goes. Maybe the producer made him to say Dhoni stuff.,8
Chennai Super Kings is going to go down like Manchester United and its going to be glorious.,4
Missed Rohit's sweaty mammary glands a lot,4
Mumbai v CSK games are always amazing. And it would be fun to see Dhoni play after such a long time.,7
"Nah mate Gavaskar, it's your opinion but I have not even it given a thought that MS is bigger than Sachin.  Maybe recency bias or something else.",9
It's here! It's finally happening. Bit late in the year for it but I'm super excited to take my annual dosage of top quality meme worthy Cricket!,5
WHO LOVES DE KOCK?,3
"Cant believe SunnyG said dhoni is popular anywhere in India and not Sachin . 

Come on dude , ya we know it may Dhoni last tournament but telling he is above Sachin is complete idiocy",7
Why is this not pinned?,1
Narrow margin of victory with minimum NRR awarded would be the best outcome of today's match.,2
Toss now?,2
Why is he screaming.,2
TOSS TOSS  TOSS TOSS TOSS TOSS TOSS TOSS,2
Why are you shouting Murali,1
"Interesting to see if COVID has any effects on Deepak Chahar's performance. Yes, he's obviously in the top 0.1% of fittest people in the world, but COVID is a strange disease that has resulted in prolonged fatigue on some very fit people. Hafeez got COVID at nearly 40 years old, and after he recovered, he was in the form of his life in England in the T20s. I'm sure the CSK staff have given Chahar the best possible treatment.",2
CSKKKK WON THE TOSS,3
[removed],2
Ngl I think csk fans are gonna get a rude awakening today,4
"Oof this toss looks CGI, is IPL actually happening or this is all a bluff?",9

"Dhoni looking fit and sharp, nice I guess.",3
Yeah yeah test cricket best cricket. However whenever I am just tired of cricket it is the IPL which brings me back. Of course this only applies because I am of Indian origin,3
[deleted],3
Thala retired at 19:29 pm ..... Returns at 19:30,25
Wonder what Karthik has to say about Rohit's lockdown changes.,8
this feels like a dream in somewhat troubled times.,4
Did Dhoni run out of Shaving Cream mid-shaving? What is that beard?,9

Hotstar sticking fucking ads at the beginning despite being a paid subscriber. Wtf,10
Pattinson playing intresting,1
Pattinson is definitely the weak link in our attack.,2
Rohit has really enjoyed his time eating during lockdown. Looks thicc like Finch from 2 years ago.,2
Link?  My Hotstar details provided by Willow are not working.,2
It should be a jailable offense for people without IPL flairs in this thread.,10
Dhoni looking so damn fit! I'm almost crushing!!,3
Mumbai's pace bowlers will like Abu Dhabi but the batsmen would have been used to Wankhede's pitch and size so its a wash.,5
"Look at the number of people on the ground!!
Isn't it a risk hazard ?",3
Damn Warne would love this huge bulky Dhoni.,10
They benched Bravo!!,6

Sunny G is not liking it outside with no Air-conditioning!,7
Will there be cricbuzz live show?,3
I think that CSK may regret leaving out Tahir. He’s a world class T20 bowler who is in great form (based on the CPL).,11
Nice to see Saurabh 'Budget Dhoni' Tiwary back in the team,10
"I can't see the option to sort comments by ""live"" on Android. Any help? The reddit app is full updated.

"Curran and Watson, CSK really going for that Twink/Bear combo",5
No Tahir after getting purple cap last year?,2
"Saurabh Tiwary, that's a throwback",3
Anyone who watches on hotstar know how much it's delayed by from actual cable TV for live sports?,1
Saurabh Tiwary ahead of Ishan Kishan is surprising from MI! Though he did have that one brilliant season with MI some years back.. Still would have preferred Kishan,2

Idk that BELIEVE ad seems to be of ill taste to me somehow,1
"Why no Ishan Kishan, please don't say that he's not retained.",0
Ngidi is picked because they need a death bowler and I remember Curran being teared a new one everytime he bowled death except against DC!,0
"It’s such a disappointment I can only have one flair on here, I can’t be bothered to change it from Kent to KKR and back whenever each team has a game",10

Would have been better without the fake noise,1

Chahar lot slower than he was last season,3
Curran could have troubled Rohit if the pitch wasn't flat,1
Seriously stop with the hate for fake crowd noise. Even Football was telecasted with fake noise as well as fake crowd. Its not worth watching without noise for a majority of viewers.,12

WTF IPL Rohit is back,2
"Is there dugout commentary on Indian TV? If so, which channel?",3
that cheer made ne chuckle,12
"If Rohit Sharma hits Sam Curran, should we consider it ragging?",3
To be honest the quiet environment of Eng vs Aus series was much much better than this unnatural spectator’s noice.,5
a lot of whinging about the crowd noise in this thread,7
Got some nice shots of Watson thickness last year hope I get some this year as well,6
Imagine T20I in Jamaica or MCG with the boundaries stretched back like they do in tests,4

Watto looking W I D E S W O L E,3
MI - Good start.,1
"Weird they’ve chosen to pump in crowd noise, the silent, empty stadium is more realistic of games played in the UAE..",10
An ad for Indian tiktok on TV? RIP.,2
Whats the point of adding crowd noise when the ball is already near the boundary please stop it,3
Hope Raina can join us mid season,2
They could have gone with any English commentator but they chose KP,2
Are we also gonna get Aeee Beee Deee.. Aeee Beee Deee... and Emmm Yess Deee.. Emmm Yess Deee... from this fake crowd?,3

"Indian ad with an American announcer on English TV, how confusing",4
Do you think Sam Curran and Dhoni ever play PUBG Mobile together?,5
Yes IPL or we'd say ads with cricket sprinkled in between,8
The sound producer thought about this for a maximum of 5 seconds,22
"Tip: Switch your stream or channel to the dugout commentary. Fewer ads,  slightly less cringy commentary and better statistical analysis.",2
Anyone getting a weird buzzing sound on Dugout?,1
Something tells me Pollard is going of murder the three pacers at the death!,3
Can they turn down the fake audience buzz. It's annoying,5
Any live streams?,3
they are doing sponsorships on the comm box too jeez,8
I wish there were non-PG broadcasts of full game stump mic coverage - not only would we get to see the spicy Aussie sledges but the sheer amount of madarchods coming out of Kohli's mouth during an RCB match would truly be a sight to behold,132
Why are team staff allowed to have phones on them? surely that's a matchfixing risk,3
"Switched to Dugout on Hotstar and the stream seems more bearable and I think there's no ad as well


Edit: Ads are everywhere! :/",8

Oh dear Chahar looks already tired,10
Stop this fake ass crowd sounds and do what England cricket did. This is goofy,1
CSK upholding Sanskari values by showing that they're not Swingers.,133
Is the crowd noise being played in the stadium or it has been added by the broadcaster ? If it’s so irritating for us - wonder how much it would irritate the players,12
looks like Mumbai police got there to lower the volume.,9
Feel bad for chahar. He is a fodder without the swing,10
MI jersey is definitely an improvement,11
Are they using fake noises,8
Outfield is so fuckin quick,3
Bangar I feel for u bro,2
Sanjay Bangar's voice is boring me to death.,4
Chahar looks like he's gonna puke any second now. Not sure if he's fully recovered from Covid19.,5
WHERE IS THE IPL TUNE,10
last time I saw cricket Delhi Daredevils were still a thing lmao,7
Need to start hashtag on Twitter mentioning star to stop crowd noises or else it's not going to happen.,3
Where is raina when you need him,4
"I may not show it, BUT I FUCKING MISS RAINA :(",5
"RR and KXIP : We don't need crowd noises , coz we are used to it.",6
M.I should surely get over 180 with this start,4
"Man there's something missing about these match threads. Get it up fellas, let's bring back the old shithousery.",4
That crowd noise is the fakest shit since Kim K.,9
"One Sanjay leaves, another comes in to torture me.",8
Why cheering for a misfield?,4
Dad fielding rubbing off on Sam Curran,11
Atleast after every boundry or wicket they wont zooom in really close on the cheerleaders. Total cringe that,14
Shyam Karan giving his all.,13
Fake crowd noise?,2
I love our jersey this year. CSK as always no change.,2
"My name's Rohit Sharma

I ain't here to create no drama

At the non strikers I got de Kock

At least I know he won't block

We playing here in Abu Dhabi

Ready to get beaten by the CSK army 

Thanks for listening folks, I accept all major cards.",10
Anybody watching in tamil commentary?,-1
The de Kock shot is something I think can be done to most Chahar deliveries today tbh. His deliveries are just sitting up on a length on this pitch with no great pace. Clear the leg and twat him.,3
CSK's fielding has been little bit too causal today.,2
"Quite like the MI jersey, looks a lot more palatable.",3
"Unpopularopinion, I'm ok with these fake audience noises. Watching at home can't really tell the difference anyway.",10
I knew csk were old but they are rusty too.,8
The best part of this IPL is no Manjarekar.,5
"Folks in 1960: we gonna have flying cars in 2020

2020: Aeeeeeee haaaaahhh aeeeeee *fake whistle noises* aeeeehh jaaaah",8

I have never been quite as sexually attracted to elbows than whenever I see De Kock in long sleeves,9
Kundi bowling...,1
Our boii lungi is here,3
Ffs Rohit. Should’ve had 2 there you fat fuck,-4
Why tf are they playing saurabh tiwary?! I swear this guy is so overrated,6
Ambient crowd noise is perfectly fine but oh my god do I hate the abrupt weird cheer for a single to square leg,5
Where does kamla pasand gets its money from??? They advertise in prime time cricket slots all the time,7
"Someone bowl a short ball to Brohit so he can play his trademark pull, I've been dying to see it.",3
The could've gotten some dummy blow up dolls to create fake audience like the Koreans did,1
Duniya hila de hum = MI saying they’ll jerk the world off,2

"The pitch looks an absolute road, high scores needed",9
That lighter shade of blue on the shirt is an improvement to MI jersey from last year,3
"r/cricket match thread guide:

Papapapapappaa,1
Wow Ngidi looks a lot older,4
Man Chahar is fucked,2
r/unpopularopinion. I started to enjoy the crowdless games. I get to hear what the players talk and the sound of bat hitting the ball.,12
MI have the lead...,1
Rohit has been gorging on vada pav during quarantine. Meanwhile Dhoni looks like he was in the gym 24x7,3
"Are all people on hotstar chat bots,they keep typing the same msg",11
QDK is such an elegant player,7
RONS,3
I haven't seen any cricket since the WC heartbreak and this feels nice. I've missed cricket,6
Chahar bowled like a corona patient.,7
"not the mumbai chant,,,",2
I swear kp has the most annoying femboy voice,2
IPL 2020 more like a SITCOM with fake laughters,5
"KP bad

Upvotes to the left",3
Is it me or it seems like everyone aged ? Then I checked my own age and I realized I am no more a youth !,7
Mumbai going at 10 per over....Aahhh such a change from the test cricket I have been watching,7
Face masks? More like Chin Masks.,3
"I’m going to say something unexpected now.

KP is a much better commentator when he’s not commentating on England.

He’s still not good, but he’s better.",3
Jay Shah is immune to covid I think.,1
Assign a team to be the home team and blare boos and cheers accordingly for the players to feel at home too.,2
De Kock looking good.,1
That's where the noise is coming from. Dada and friends.,7
"Not only is the crowd fake, it's also dumb. No clue when to start cheering at all",8

Ganguly and Shah on different couches. #Rift confirmed.,5
200 incoming,1
"Can someone tell Jay Shah to unbutton his suit, that single button on is hurting my OCD",5
Chahal would've hit that for 6,6
Get fuckd,2
"The sound mixing is Shit... hate the whole thing, the fake vuvuzelas , fake boundary cheers... just put the sound of bat on ball...nothing else is required",3
Who's that chomu without a mask in VIP box?,5
We need something special from any CSK player for them to have a chance today  I guess.,1
Can this crowd noise fuck off,6
"Any free streaming sites, lads? Both my friends are using my Hotstar account - argh!",3
The cock looks in such a good touch! Good improvements from last season,2
Dhoni's new look doesn't look good at all.,2

This tournament is going to boost the average scores of all the UAE grounds.,5
Ngidi is bowling low IQ balls,2
Lungi exposed by de Kock,6
This. Is. A. Shit. Pitch.,1
The fake cheers and chants are hilarious to hear if they are going to show the empty stands so much.,9
[deleted],-5
Bowl Watson already,1
"It's gonna be a 200 from MI, CSK just can't beat them",3
KHAUF,1
CSK looks like they just came from a 12 hour red-eye flight and were asked to play cricket right after landing.,5
They are literally not wearing the masks properly,3
"Is there a prohibition on alcohol in place in UAE? If there is, then the decision to play a song which goes ""Wo Sharabi Kya Sharabi"" seems very amusing.",3
"11 blue shirt kids playing together , gonna be fun",2
So Ngidi is showing some rust,3
What’s up with Dhoni’s beard lol,3

Covid ek coughnaak bimari hai,2

Boss Baby Jayant Shah,1

Lungi unable to control de Kock,6

Aaah I missed this shit so much,2
de kock is hard today,2
Ganguly not taking any risks. BTW did you hear the sheikh pronounce Ganguly's name? Lmao,1
"Ronaldo is asked to wear masks even in stands but our Jay Shah rockin his looks without mask. Hence, BCCI=ICC >FIFA",8
These sound effects as poor as they maybe are still way better than no noise at all,3
Buttman getting it hard,1
you think Ngidi will play next game fellas?,2
None of them wearing their masks over their nose smh,3
"I don't know man something is off, surely its something to do with crowd.  Hope I'll will warm up.",7
Telecast quality between ECB production and BCCI is telling.,3
"Nice to see Quinny doing well, but a bit sad to see Ngidi being taken to the cleaners.",4
QDK is so entertaining,3
Wides need to be sponsored by a construction company or something,8

Looks like it might turn out to be a damp squib 1 sided affair,1
Wear the bloody mask Jay Shah. Your father has just barely recovered and you are sitting there like an ass.,4
How many MI fans in the house?,5
"""Mom can we have a slow pitch at home""

You have been played Ngidi,2
Dhoni's beard looks like sakshi babhi had a big accident  while doing his beard,4
"Man this 2020 update sucks, why have they degraded the bowlers

Too easy for batsmen",6
When QDK in touch he’s the most elegant left handed.,4
DO I SPY BIG DADDY CHAWLA?,4
Give it to spinners Dhoni,2
This MI kit makes my head hurt,2
Is the pitch really that easy or are csk playing garbo,1
RCB hoti toh ab tak 2 wicket le li hoti,7
Who is csk's uncapped player??,3
CSK's bowling is looking toothless. They're getting nothing out of this pitch.,4
"If this was Chennai, Dhoni will choke the runs in middle overs with spinners. But it is not Chennai so MI going 180+ I guess.",4
Hotstar streaming sucks! Random pixelated buffers and shit.,8
"Aight, crowd ain’t bad. It’s pretty good now. Yeah I’m backtracking -_-",9
Is Mitchell Mcclenaghan still a part of MI squad? I find him a better t20 bowler than Pattinson and Boult.,5
IPL is here and so am I,7
2020 has been so wild that MI looks like they are finally going to win their opening game.,10
The fake crowd noises remind me of taped WWE era. Sounds like a hair dryer lol,5
"With the fake crowd noise and the shots these two are playing, it really feels like EA Cricket 07",8

Fucking hell Slater already,2
[deleted],9
"“It’s their home ground”

I did not know they changed their name to Mumbai United Arab Emiratis",10
I haven’t been following the IPL moves. So seeing Chawla for CSK is fucking mind boggling,5
Seeing pitch I guess mi shd have picked Lynn for tiwari and kulkarni for Pattinson,2
Seriously cant wait for a Delhi match,3
Piyush got thiccccccc,4
"Yesss chonky boi into the attack, you love to see it",4

Chawla is chonky,2
Piyush is such a unit,2
I'm getting a feeling that spinners are gonna get thrashed like crazy on this pitch,2
Chawla looks like the stereotypical “funny uncle” from Hindi dramas,6
Dekock to Ngidi : Look at me. I am the captain now.,6
Wtf. Has Piyush Chawla always been this tubby?,4
How did Chawla pass the yo-yo test? Probably can't see his own dick if he looked down with that gut.,1
Fun fact : Piyush Chawla is younger than Rohit Sharma,10
"Hotstar high only looks like 720P

There is no way to watch in 1080P really a shame",5
Piyush Chawla looks like he ate young Piyush Chawla,31
I love Chawla so much. There's something about a fat leggy,8
Parthiv Patel and Piyush Chawla never grow old,3
The graphics always look so shitty in IPL,1
RCB fans seem so weirdly confident about winning the IPL this time. I can't get that thread out of my head. It's kind of unnerving.,3
Catching practice,2
"Sam Curran getting an IPL contract off the back of biffing India in a test match a couple of times is still very, very funny",2
"Tin tin de kock is on a roll, might expect him to score a century or something idk",3
nohit nohit nohit,1
ARRE YOU KIDDING ME??? AMAZING,2
"Guys the fake noise is there for a reason. It is for the casual fans. They will change the channel without it. They won't even notice it's fake. And they know, those of us who know it's fake, are going to watch it anyway.

This look of Dhoni sucks.,4
Nice to give the work experience kid some catching practice,3
Lol at that delay in the crowd reaction,8
Thicc boy let's go,4
"Haha lol, totally forgot about Chawla playing for CSK. Honestly for a player that has had such a huge impact, Chawla seems to go unnoticed quite a lot. A lot of people even forgot he was part of the 2011 Indian World Cup team.",4
"**4.4** Chawla to Sharma, OUT, **chipped straight to mid-off!** **46-1**

Piyush Chawla and amit mishra are the two underrated pillars of IPL,5
Unfair contest between MI and Senior Citizens Xi recovering from Covid.,3
De Kock surviving against spin longer than Rohit Sharma. Spin mats are working.,3
The grass on the pitch was such a bait. Both teams should have played an extra spinner,1
Yaaaay ipl is back,1
"Nothing to see here, just rohit performing under par in IPL again",1
After the first ball Boundary i was shocked but now Ipl Rohit is back.,2
The lucky charm starts it for CSK,1
Clearly the bandana has a magnet which attracted the metal chip in the ball planted by Ambani.,4
Here we go!,1
Piyush Chawla makes me so happy,1
Chawla looks like a 50 year old man in the profile photo,3
Paid 50$ to watch shitty ads on hotstar smh,5
"BC we know how Kohli sounds , why do brands do those voice overs ?",3
Sharma is so obvious to figure out. He'll smash the pacers but get a spinner and he'll hand you his wicket if he's less than 20 runs in.,1
YES boushrat kheir. Arabic music ftw,2
Damn body shaming is real here.,9
The gold in the Mumbai jersey makes it look more tacky imo,2
Fake stadium announcer too!!,1

Does Chawla bowl anything other than a googly?,7
Incoming Kedar Jadhav shoulder injury.,2
This fall of wicket was like when you purposefully lose your wicket in gully cricket because your mom is shouting from the balcony for you to come home.,3
Wait why did KKR give away Piyush chawla,5
Why does csk even bother with fast bowlers? Should just use spinners,1
Looks like Piyush Chawla has eaten a lot of Jamuns in quarantine,2

Why are the Indian players so overweight? Players like rohit and chawla are shockingly fat for professional athletes,4
Miss the commentary banter,2
[deleted],3
Dhoni: I'm still worthy,6
Pattinson is not going to handle the heat  and he's not a T20 bowler,2
Piyush Chawla is 31?? He was 22 while winning the world cup?? I thought he was 31 in 2011,12
Wish CSK had played Imran Tahir. He'd have been perfect for this pitch.,3
"Behenchod if athletes have become this dummy thicc then imagine what world of lardasses and tubsters we're going to enter after this shit is over.

BMI will need to be recalibrated by increasing two points for every category.",17
"Ya, don't buy Hershey kisses... It's just overpriced trash. Thank me later!",8
seems like hotstar is experiencing such traffic after a year  and not being able to handle it.,5
2nd time KP has had a go at his monumentally shite 'banter' in the last couple of months.,2

Pollard and Pandya behind.  Should CSK take a wicket or not? The Dre Russel paradox,6
Time for tiwary to strategically get out,3
Why is Tahir looking like an actual lion?,4

*smacks dust off R/Cricket after months* WASSUP MY BITCHES! *tears of joy*,3
Why is Tahir not playing?,3

What the fuck is that noise?,2
If Chawla is 31 then Barry Jenkins from Bargoed is my mother,4
"Geez they're really not gonna let us enjoy Pandya and Pollard are they, these two?",2
The bowling changes have been so good.,2
Chawla looks like he found Rohit’s vadapav stash!,2
"What a ball from Chahar, Well played by Sky",2
Someone clicked the crowd noise button by accident there?,4
This is the first IPL game I have ever watched. What is that horn noise? Pretty fun,3
"After watching England matches , feeling a little bit unusual.& Wierd.",1

Chawla : look at me I am the Tahir now,4
Don't really like this MI jersey tbh.,-3
"Pandya brothers and Pollard still left, I would like to see one of them bat for 8-9 overs.",5
who would have thought Saurabh would out last Manoj Tiwary,4
Chawla transformed himself from a baby faced teenager to the neighborhood unkill in 2 years.,5
"Batsman taps the ball with the bat.

Fan noise: aaaaaaaaah",17
Deepak chahar should be considered for test matches in swinging conditions. He has a natural outswinger to right handers which none of our bowlers have(except perennially injured Kumar),2
Would be nice if they turn up the stump mic every now and then.,2
Did tahir have a mullet?,1
Is that Tahir or Wolverine?,9
Why is Faf falling down and hurting himself for no reason,5
Pace off the ball will be key in Dubai.,2
Did SKY just roll around in an ink pool? what even is that tattoo,0
The fake crowd noise is getting on my nerves. Turn up the stump mic and let me listen to that instead of this BS,15
"S Tiwary once ended up over someone's head in the opposition dugout after leaping backwards near the boundary line. Can someone tell which match was it? IIRC, he was part of RCB then.",2
Tiwari makes running look so difficult.,11
Pitch getting slower than a Ferrari SF1000,9
Satnav has put on weight he no longer looks like an Engineering nerd,2
"Rohit Tiwary and Pollard?

Mumbai Indians putting the MI in BMI",15
Almost like whoever is in charge of crowd noise is watching the hotstar stream with the lag and everything,2
I always get this feeling that MI doesn't trust their big hitters. Its like their mentality is that these guys are only allowed to bat after 15th over,-1
Any pointers for a first time IPL follower?,4
Can they not hire a person to handle the intensity of the fake crowd noise in real-time depending on what happens in the game? Just heard a roar on a dot ball 🤦‍♂️,8
"Memebai Chonkians, where the idea of a balanced diet is an Araam Vada Pav in both hands.

Was the ipl ever 5 international players in the 11 before ?,3
I hope Disney force Hotstar off their ass and improve their streaming quality,0
Tiwari should go for it. No point in Pollard coming in the 19th over with the form he's been in recently.,2
New job positions in Covid: play crowd noises during games,2
"""If you get a bad egg or two who starts to sulk, it just runs through a team"" gee I wonder what former player turned commentator could possibly embody that kind of scenario",6
Imran Tahir genuinely looks around 60,3
Tiwari is like Gayle with 10% of the hitting capabilities.,5
Fucking hotstar charging me $50/year to show me ads every 5 minutes,6

Did anyone yet commented waiting for Brohit and Saurabh running b/w wickets?,1
YES!!! CURRAN IS THE BEST CSK PLAYER!,7
MAKES THINGS HAPPEN,3
FUCKK OFF SKY!,1
Pretty sure Chawla vs Hardik is on Dhoni's mind. He's going to do all he can to avoid that matchup. KKR vs MI 2019 proves it all.,1
Poor SKY thought it was Wankhede,3
Curran you sweet son of a bitch,5
Sam Curran involved in every wicket so far. Truly does make things happen.,7
Curran is singlehandedly bringing down CSK average age,8
Pitch got corona now,1
Pandya in the house !!,1
I honestly expect every catch to be dropped by the fielders! So far 2 was from Curran which was lucky I guess! But Watto plucked a good one too,3
is Sam Curran better than BBL legend Tom Curran,6
Unexpected. Not complaining though 😁,2
CHAHAR MY BOY,3
2 catches 1 wicket Sam Curran,4
I thought that would go for a six,2
Oh no. Is it against the spiritnof of the game to intentionally drop catches?,1
[deleted],1
I don’t like the fake crowd noise but honestly think it’s still better than the on pitch player interviews they do in the BBL,2
I thought he timed it well. Now come the big hitters.,1
Aaj Karane ke aata abhi Pandya ji,1
Vadapav vs Idli Sambar,1
Sam Curran has been involved in all 3 dismissals. There's just something about some players. I could never explain it.,4
Commentary is dodgy,1
The first normal thing of 2020 is Mumbai crumbling against CSK,1
AND THE CROWD GOES MILDDDDD,3
"**10.6** Chahar to Yadav, OUT, **taken at long-on!** Curran involved again. **92-3**

SA Yadav c Curran b Chahar 17 (16b 2x4 0x6) SR: 106.25",1
This would've been a six on any ground in India😅,0
MI should look to have a floater at #7 and push Pandyas and Pollard up one position,1
Has Sam Curran hit puberty yet?,6
Would that have been close to a 6 in Wankhede?,2
Legit was a 6 at Wankhede lol.,5
"I really like KP as a commentator. He isn't afraid to break away from cliches and his judgement of the choices made by players doesn't depend on the outcomes. 

1. When Pant got out trying to slog in the 2019 WC semi final, all the commentators were castigating him saying what a dumb choice it was. KP was the only one to say that he would be praised and called brave had that shot come off. KP mentioned that it was poor execution, not necessarily bad shot selection.

2. In this game, QdK tried to ramp one shot in the powerplay and Gavaskar was heaping praise on him saying how clever the choice was. KP said that it was too risky given the match situation and the fact that there was already a man there.

3. Curran was bowling full early in the powerplay and got hit for a four. Again, Gavaskar called it a loose delivery but KP said that there was nothing wrong in bowling full to get an early wicket.

And no, I don't have machops with a gun on my head who made me write this.",12
MAKES THINGS HAPPEN,4
"The fake audio has been trialled and used in many sports now, including Eng's international games this summer.

How have IPL's home broadcasters (Star?) got it so bad?

Hardik is all legs,3
"Incredibly happy that this IPL we'll see some titillation of long boundaries, slow pitches and 140-ish totals rather than the usual hardcore porn of Chinnaswamy level cricket",5
If I was stranded on a deserted island without food I would want Chawla to be my companion. The meat on him would literally feed me for years.,4

LMAO Curran showing aggression to big daddy polly. Did he forget what happened to Mitch starc last time around?,7
If they're going to add in recorded crowd noise then they could atleast added in the drums and whatever that that rolling thing is called which makes a whistle like noise,8
The fake crowd noise could be replaced by the laughing track in Big Bang theory and it would still be less annoying,12

Am on a diet right now. Then I see these thicc players earn millions and wonder what's even the point,14
"Well CSK bat all the way till 8 with proper quality, then you have Chawla and Chahar who can bat a bit too.",2
Umpire looks like Aleem Dar without the beard.,2
it's free on hotstar now.. since when?,4
Any reasons why its not 8 pm IST start but 7:30 IST start? The pitches could have been much quicker under lights,2
Yo legit tho why is Saurabh in the team? Did he do well in domestic or something? What happened to Ishan Kishan,4
"It would be good if these people on ore match post mid match talk something else than CSK and Dhoni. 
Yeah he is back after 437 days, don't need reminders 437 times. there are two teams playing but it seems that they want to talk only about one team",2
"Dhoni looks really buffed. For some reason, I don't think it'll help with his batting. A gym body may not be as great for batting as a smaller muscle but with faster response.",3
"Thala Dhoni the man who can revitalize any Spinner and in particular Leg spinner
Piyush Chawla for Indian team comeback ;)",7
Honestly the digital Cheerleading is the funniest thing I've seen in this Covid break.,9
It's kinda crazy Watto is only 39. Australia wasted him,12

Really is a great chance for Vijay. Its either he comes really good or disappears into history for good.,3
One spicy inswinger delivered right at the toes of batsman Boulto please,3

Here comes the thiccest of em all,2

I have missed a Bumrah yorker and a Boult inswinging delivery on the pads so much.,5

Anyone know the average age of CSK?,2

This IPL will be known for most dad bods & thicc boys ever in the history of IPL,15
Murali Kartik or Sanjay Bangar? Pick your poison.,2
I miss 2010 Vijay,5
Boults fielding is gonna be a big plus today!,3
...did i hear it right?,3
The players are so buffed up now it reminds me of cricket 07,4
No swing for boult either,2
...Did the commentator say pollard is the real slim shady?,12
Gavaskar and others are just so fucking high,9
wtf is this commentary,8
The fuck is this commentary,7
Pollard must be the second or third highest all time earner from west Indies with his t20 career success.,2
Gavaskar commentary is so cringe,6
"Am I hearing things or did Sunny just call one of the KPs the ""real slim shady""?",5
No. 1 and 2 bowlers in ODI. Have so much high hopes from them.,2
Vijay is so eager to help Watson lose weight that dude is trying to get a single at every opportunity.,1
OPEN WITH PANDYA YOU FUCKING COWARDS,10
Where's all this noise coming from? Or is this like a laugh track?,-1
Boult is throwing actual bolts damn!,3
Brohit and Polly vs Chawla and VJ. The battle of Thiccbois.,3
Shot,1
it's a pity there's no audience or spectators at the game... thats a beautiful stadium,4
Fake crowd is totally not in sync with the rhythm of the match. Misses nuances. Like when a wicket falls crowd goes silent if it’s a home crowd. Here it’s always cheerful. After a bit it gets annoying.,8
Sunny G needs to stfu,5
When I first started watching IPL in 2013 I thought Shane Watson and Faulkner were the same person.,9
Piyush Chawla looks like that uncle who interrupts kids during match to play a few balls but actually ends up playing a few overs.,15
GIVEN !,2
Those gold streaks on the MI jersey need to go,10
CLASSIC WATTO LMAO,11
Looked Plumb.,6
"Yeah baby, review it Watson.",6
He's finally learned not to review!,20
S-H-I-T,3
I'm really excited to hear Mark Nicolas this season ..,3

Watto not reviewing?! Absolute scenes.,11
Everyone in the universe is taking shit reviews and Watson refused to. Love it,7

watto sacrificed his wicket to get the commentators to shut up about KP,10
"**0.6** Boult to Watson, OUT, **massive appeal and he's given lbw.** Won't review it. **5-1**

SR Watson lbw b Boult 4 (5b 1x4 0x6) SR: 80.00",3
Typical Watson dismissal,3
I'm extra sure that r/cricket would've collectively orgasmed if watson went for  a review on that lbw,13
"Boult is bowling lightning fast. Haha, see ya later, lads",3
No DRS wasted. Watson has changed man,6
Death taxes and watto getting lbw,4
LEFT ARM ANGLE,3
"Shane Watson not taking a review.

Well lot has changed this year.",6
"Watson not taking a review against LBW, 2020 is truly crazy.",10
Watson is a changed man. Things what lockdown can do to one.,7
Watto not reviewing that?,3
2020 is so weird that Watson has stopped reviewing lbw decisions!,5
lmao @ stayin’ alive playing at the wicket,2
Fully expected Watto to review that absolutely plumb lbw,5
"If Watson didn't review it, you know its probably the deadest of dead LBWs.",5
Waiting for big Cornwall to make his IPL debut.,2
Watson saving everything for the final.,4
That looked exactly the kind of dismissal Watson would review,6
Watson walking away its 2020 indeed,4
Just looking at each team trying to figure out who to support but damn Super Kings have some seriously old players batting,4
"Watto not referring an LBW

Impossible things happening in IPL 2020",11
Of course Watson hasn't reviewed it's 2020,9
Only Watson could even consider reviewing that.,11
Was expecting watto to review that. Maybe the memes have finally got to him.,4
"Watto lbw, the memes",2
Gavaskar is like that uncle everyone has who has achieved a lot and everyone agrees he's great but is hitting that age where you just want him to STFU and stop embarrassing himself.,11
I hope we have fake dead disappointed rcb crowd voices too,25
Watto not reviewing a plumb Lbw is the most fucked thing to happen in 2020,12
Sunil Gavaskar commentary is loathsome,8

I think KP will be the Sanju Manju of this season.,2
Mfw I get replaced by an 11 year old who learned coding through WhiteHatJr,4
What did Gavaskar do?,1
Wtf is this crowd noise...totally out of sync with the game,2
Vijay basically shat on his IPL career to become India's test opener. Good to see him back. Hope he scores 1(24) but only because it's against Mumbai,3
Rohit gotta shed some pounds though. That's like peak Fathews,3
We need to keep Sunny G talking about batting or Game plans to make him bearable.,3
I just want to see Sammy come out at 4 and score a shithouse 40(21),4
Ah csk and slow starts. The perfect pair.,9
Ummm no,1
Man! The way they setup watson was so great. The ball before was outswinger and then an in swinger,1
Patto hype,2
Wat was that son?,1
I want to see just one vijay pull,2
The most CSKesque innings ever,4
"I've heard ""wantedly"" on national television. I can die happy now.",3
I really wanna see Sunny G get into a debate about Mumbai with Kangana.,9
"These people have Boult, Pattinson as a new ball attack, Bumrah in the middle and Alzarri Joseph as a practice bowler.",4
Faf is going to bail out CSK unfortunately,5
That looked plumb,6
Vijay Come on Man..u still got itt,3
Vijay is literally missing everything,8
Height maybe? Jeez that was close.,2
"Leg before Wat- 

No",2
"It was close, should have referees",3
Ffs,1
Gotta review that,1
That looked plumb.,4
Review it cowards,4
Thought I heard 2 sounds.,1
Crowd cheers as Murli Vijay hits the ball toward a fielder for a dot,14
Pattinson is hitting the bat near the sticker. Very difficult to hit him.,2
That looked close,5
"If there was no bat, that was out",2
Looked dead.,3
Ro”tund”hit man :),3
Gone,1
That's a bad missed review,3
Take the review fucks sake,4
Why is Pattinson so thicc rn lol,6
Vijay is fucking clueless. No timing.,5
Okay but why does Pattinson look like a crackhead,5
Bowling beautifully here,2
Can we find better commentators than Murali karthik please.. Cant hear him for the next two months,6
Nick?,1
"Surprised they didn't review, umpire's call at worst",1
Show the replay you fucks,3
Just watched Watson's dismissal. He didn't review it?,1
They didn’t review it because they want Vijay to stay in,4
Rohit's really let himself go here. Fat af,1
Strategic non review from Rohit,3
Classic csk,2
Murali Vijay auditioning to get back in the Indian Test Squad.,5
Awesome !!!,1
Vijay gone for good.,1
PATTOH!!,1
This pace bowling attack might be the stuff of dreams.,2
Damn! Mumbai bowling on point,3
PLUMB.,2
Doesn't matter now,5

THESE LBWS,1
Oldies are struggling..,1

LBW barrage.,3
Such a good bowling pair,1
Boomer team struggling here,4
Pattinson bowling that perfect line and length!,6
Murli Vijay playing like flaming trash,5
Only a matter of time. He looked so edgy,3
Lol CSK batters looking like complete amateurs out there,5
Did Rohit bring Vadapav for the entire team or what,1
"Would be stupid to think chennai if they do it, will do it easily",1
Faf is like wtf man,2
Good Lord,2
"4d chess by Brohit to make Vijay waste 2 more balls. 

Best captain in the universe.",3
Pattinson is god.,1
Vijay can come back home. No point staying in UAE.,1
Bumrah hasn't even come yet. MI attack is fire,5
"Shame some of the best T20 players, Imad Wasim/Babar Azam etc, still not involved.",1
Nice.,2
That was missing leg with the direction.,2
I've not seen Vijay do well at all in the past 2-3 years,1
"I'm starting a cult of Pattinson, who wants to join?",2
I think this was drifting down the LEGSIDE.,2
Man sports suck football/ cricket anything anime is way better,-5
"This one looked less out.

Lol",11
Time for Dhoni to do his thing ! (Meaning 30(60)),5
This is godlike bowling,1
Why won't you review?!,4
Where is Danny Morrison boys,3
Lol that’s not out,5
Lol that was not out but the first one was out so things balance out,8
"Unlike us mere mortals, it looks like Swiggy never removed Super subscription of Rohit",8
Beautifully bowled Pattinson !!,2
Murali Vijay shouldn't be in any T20 team ... surely not in 2020.,4
This one's missing,7
Haha. The umpire clownery starts.,4
"In b4 dhoni plays match winning knock.      
 I hope I jinx him",3
Vijay forgot that he can move his legs while batting,10
bhenchod,5
"**1.6** Pattinson to Vijay, OUT, **has him this time!** But is that going down? It could well be... **6-2**

M Vijay lbw b Pattinson 1 (7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 14.28",2
Pattinson has gone from 18 year old sensation to 39 year old uncle. How has he aged so much,6
"Is Patto the T20 seamer that we've been looking for?

&#x200B;

Need to see him at the death though",3
Well that does look missing leg on second view,4
Where's the ball tracking replay? We didn't see one for either of the calls.,7
"Vijay playing out a maiden, you're kidding me.",5
[removed],5
"Can we have ball tracking for both the balls please?

Star, are you still alive?",2
Which version of Dhenier are we going to see today?,2
Should’ve reviewed that.,2
Retirees are going to bed early tonight maybe?,2
"This is some fabulous pace bowling

Quality stuff 💯",3
4D chess by Rohit for not taking that review. Vijay played 2 dots after that ball and got out.,4
Should have reviewed,1
Ambani bought Umpires memes incoming,4
Lol. This is the most rusty IPL batting I have ever seen,6
Dhoni gonne come at over 10 play and test cricket. Everyone loses their mind. But it somehow ends up a close finish.,2
\#FafWasRight,3
Patto is bowling nice..,2
Is Dugout better or normal English?,2
Holy shit that UpGrad ad LMAOOO,1
Can I get ball tracking for both the appeals?,5
Classic 2018 vibes csk struggling and from nowhere bravo wins them game who would be the hero this time,5
3D man in the house!,2
Senior Citizens' XI,2
Absolute drama. I think the previous ball was out and this one was sliding towards leg.  Both decided not to review,5
First one looked out. Second one looked not out....,4
"Just want fafs wicket, he is having a lucky day today",0
"Everytime there will be target around 160,
And we think CSK will win and they Fuck it up against MI :'(",1
Guys y'all have been saying even year MI will shit the bed but it's 2020 🔥🔥🔥,3
You know a batsman is struggling when he doesn't take the review his partner insists on,7
"Chutiya katwane se acha out ho jate hai

  


\- kapil Dev",10
3d glasses out bois,4
Enna da idhu,2
Murali Vijay walked there without listening to Du Plessis. Rohit Sharma told Vijay that Faf was calling him. The real sportsmanship gesture.,12
Where the crowd noise is coming from?,2
5D Rayudu walks in,5
J pat is so fucking good.,4
Man I hate this fake crowd noise. The coverage and commentary was so much better in the English cricket recently,2
Patto gets tonked in the big meme league,5
What are the pitches like in Abu Dhabi,1
"Top batsman doesn't take review despite non-striker insisting, for a clearly not-out appeal. Shady CSK things",9
I remember how Bravo took the game away last year with his dancing akward sixes,5
Rayudu's probably faced his first ball as an opener at a higher score last year. Top stuff from MI,2
Faf deliberately didn't review since he knew Vijay would just play dots #KheloDimaagSe,4
What’s taking so long to show Hawkeye for both Vijay LBW decisions?,2
Why are CSK's top 4 all T20 openers?,2
Lol missing,1
Should've reviewed lmao,1
Its FAF vs MI today,3
Vijay seems to have lost his marbles after fooling around with DK's wife. How could he not have reviewed that?,9
"Genius Brohit. 

Doesn't review the first one so that they could milk a few more dots from Murli Vijay",78
WTF. That's on Faf,7
Lmao,4
Looking forward to some 360 degree shots by Rayudu,7
So umpire let the obvious lbw go and gave the obvious not out away,9
Thank fuck he didn't review that. Never wanna see Vijay ever again,6
That looked like it was sliding down tbh,1
"Vijay knew he was not out, but was sure that he will waste lot of balls so decided to walk",14
"Put on your 3D glasses boys, some front foot defence coming",6
This feels like the 2019 WC semifinal all over again.,9
the gold on the MI jersey is so ugly,7
Pattinson looks like an intense bloke.,3
Imagine not doing what Faf asks you to do,9
Vijay not reviewing will turn out better for Csk.,4
Now show the DRS for the first 1. Both teams didn't take the review when they should have.,5
Vijay 200 IQ(only in wife stealing),7
"CSK against other teams: 50-0

CSK against Mumbai: 7-2",8
missed you Gavaskar!! /S,3
I thought the point was to stay at the wicket as long as possible.,3
Ah the classic IPL umpiring,7
Friendly reminder that Bumrah hasn't even bowled yet.,10
3d 😎😎,7
Isn’t James Pattinson great at test cricket?,1
I think you must have all forgot about the crowd noise. And it feels better now,5
I swear I've seen csk at 7-2 vs mi b4,5
Ambati Rayadu. Oh I miss this guy. All weather man.,5
Hard to feel for Vijay knowing the kind of person he is,10
The more enthusiastic appeal and LBW shout just before definitely played on the Umpire's mind.,9
"36 years

39 years

36 years

34 years

39 years

35 years",16
Mumbai was so confident of getting Vijay out that they didn't bother to take review and milk more dots out of him.,4
Looks like It was the guilt of the first lbw that made Murali Vijay walk on the next one . Also what umpiring is this ?,8
shit IPL umpiring persists,5
3D chess from M Vijay. Knows he’s shit. So he doesn’t review.,31
"Vijay isn't going to do it.

He barely touched one ball. CSK have to find a new batsman.",11
faf suggested vijay to take a review i dont think he wanted to stay any longer on the pitch,25
[deleted],16
"I already do not like the IPL telecast. Hawk eye replays not shown, wicket replays not shown. I hope there's no adverse effect of Covid on the production team.",4
CSK uncles showing their age. M.Vijay looked like a gold fish in the middle of Sahara Desert against Pattison,6
No offence to fans but CSK batting is too boring to watch.. should have bought someone like Banton to spice up the top order.,11
"New IPL teams from where?

1. Uttar Pradesh (Lucknow)
2. Bihar (Patna)
3. Haryana (Gurgaon? Faridabad? or simply Haryana)
4. Gujrat",2
Vijay got out soon so he could steal a girl,3
Boult just went bonkers with that last delivery!,2
Vijay should be nowhere near this team. What a waste of space.,1
Watch MI punch them into a corner and one of the players goes Bravo level berserk and wins it for CSK,4
"No, *Thicc Boi*. You ain't getting there..",2
Mi pace attack will be a very good test attack,1
Ambati Rayudu will today show how wrong Koach was by blasting Boult's inswing to all parts of the Emirates.,1
Wtf the ball that was wicket was declared not out and the one which was not out declared out😂😂,2
"Boult and Pattinson get wickets.
McClenaghan: Phir toh apna kaam khalas",2
[deleted],6
Is it just me or did Rohit sort of give up at the last moment on that boundary?,8
Rohit's done 2 days worth of treadmill work with that chase to the boundary.,14
"I think Vijay knew he wasn’t out, just didn’t want to be out there anymore, soaking up balls struggling.",6
Yooo i love these comments than the actual match,6
Restricting for a below par score -> top order collapses -> Dhoni somehow creates a partnership with a lower order batsmen or raina -> either takes them over the line or his partner gets out. Has happened way too many times.,9
Scoreboard updation too slow,4
Bumrah not even into the attacc gg wp 6 times lost to Mumbai :(((((,3
Pretty cool of the groundspeople to quickly switch the pitch to a bowler friendly wicket in the break,2
"He could have chased it down, slowed down midway before realising that it could be chased.",1
Clearly shows a lack of desire or conviction in Vijay's game and mindset... I think CSK should just look to a younger Indian batsman than trying to give Vijay more chances.,5
"Bumrah Bolt Pattinson. 

Looks real scary. Like the 2000s Australian pace lineup.",11
Moral of the story. Faf is the chosen one. Listen to him,7
Extra chunks of fat costing Mumbai that boundary.,9
Good to see Pattinson bowling well,5
"HAhaha, Rohit gives up running in between, then realises it still hasn’t boundary and starts running again. Inspiring fielding.",22
Rohit would have chased the ball if it was a vada pav.,6
These two should see El Boulto and Patto out so that they can tonk trundler like Bumrah ;-),2
"Good test match

2020 has us playing test in colour Jersey",3
"Just saw Pandya dab after doing a bottle flip, did these ads just meet 2017",7
"The 2007 wc, his IPL hattrick, winning the IPL with DC, becoming opener, becoming MI captain, 3 200s, marriage, fatherhood, 2019 wc heartbreak. 

All of these flashed before Rohit's eyes as he chased that ball to the boundary",33
That was a freebie.,4
Missing Raina now,0
That was beautiful,1
my highly optimized machine learning algorithm forecasts that CSK 40 all out.,13
3D Shot^TM,5
Guys when you talk about thicc boi you are referring Rohit Sharma right?😅,7
[removed],19
"Lmao just realised bumrah hasn't even bowled yet

Rip lmao",35
What was the 3D thing with Rayudu I don't remember,9
"It's amazing how small the margin of error is for bowlers in limited overs matches

Anything wide outside off gets put away, anything down leg is wide. Pretty much have to bowl stump to stump or on 4th stump",4
Tbh this CSK batting lineup looks pathetic. And this comes from someone who has supported them since 2008.,7
I really feel for all developers after watching whitehat jr ads.,16
"Goodness me, why wasn't this lad (read:legend aka Rayudu) selected for WC19? Ahh, here we go again.",5
Watson is out of form in playing a long innings,2
CSK batting lineup is almost old enough to be in the high risk corona category,42
Mumbai has such a great bowling attack. Bumrah doesn't have to ball in first powerplay,4
Jadeja should be moved up the Oder when the spinners come out. Need a left hander in the batting line up,4
And Bumrah is yet to bowl!,7
8D shot from Rayudu,10
Rayudu's half open bat makes me anxious.,6
"Just so you guys know, I love 3D jokes featuring Rayudu.",12
High IQ plays from CSK getting through their batting order asap so that Sam “Makes thing happen” Curran can get in earlier,49
Rayudu had a strike rate of 93 last season! Fucking hell.,12
Dafaq even a dot ball in the 3 over gets a loud cheer. Bruhhh,10
Crowd noise has not been optimized,2
I forgot. What’s the 3D joke guys,9
Pattinson is going to be a problem in the test series.,7
Pattinson is bringing ball back in. Not easy.,2
"I still believe India would have won that semifinal if Rayudu played in that WC. It was absolute shit decision by Koach to let him go. 
He was good, just had one bad series and he was out.",4
Pattinson is good sign on these UAE wickets.,2

"Hotstar is running ads on movies I watched months ago, atleast advertise new ones",10
They can play out Boult and Pattinson knowing that they can target easier bowlers like Bumrah and Chahar.,8
"CSK to lose to MI 5 times a row : it is the El Classico of IPL bro

Pak lose to India in ICC tournaments frequently especially since the last decade or so: The rivalry is dead. Bangladesh our true rivals",4

CSK is going to take this game deep^TM",15
Rayudu is looking in silky touch. Very odd.,8
"Rayudu: YAH KOACH, TALK NAH!",12
Rayudu driving Boult,2
That ball boy looks fit enough to be in the team,6
Dugout has ads now. This is why we need alternatives to capitalism,15
Rayudu came out of retirement?,14
Boult stick to the stumps m8,1
That was sweetly timed,1
That daily hunt ad with bed recommendations is so fucking weird and scary,3
"Rayudu: I was left out of WC despite being best candidate for that position. *sad noises* 

Laxman: First time here?!",15
"Even if he gets out now, Rayudu looks in much better shape and form than he did all of last season.",8
Feel like I'm watching a test match.,3
"csk not rotating the strike well..
so many dot balls..",3
My man L Balaji looking good,6
Bat Curran at 5 you cowards,12
Rrr is almost 10 already,3
TIL Jadhav uncle has a higher strike rate than Jadeja,8
I am surprised Rohit didn't gain weight during the lockdown.,2
Just bring in bumrah to finish the game. He looked unplayable in training,2
You know why ipl goes on for so long? To give you time to read all the sponsors on the shirts.,9
If Boult and Pattinson are in this form. MI bowling is basically unplayable.,3
I see Chennai gunning for fair play award by not even challenging the umpire,9
"Rayudu usually looks rattled against fast pace, should get Bumrah on next",2
Guys is Rayudu good? Haven't heard of him recently that's why I am asking,1
Rayudu's nips are certainly 3D,4
"Leaving the ball.

MSD school of batsman ship.",8
Can’t tell if it’s the full plate of momos I had or CSK’s starting overs that’s putting me to sleep right now,7
Santner with that stubble looking delicious,5
"Rayudu learning from THALA.

RRR is 10 and this fucker is leaving balls outside off",6
Hahah the comm box had to mention 3 dimensions when talking about Santaner while rayadu is batting,1
Make Chawla open you cowards,8
"Mitch Santner 3DS Max , coming up",3
I thought pace wouldn't be that effective but MI are proving me wrong,5
CSK's matches are the most boring out of any team. Punjab (when KL Rahul or Gayle aren't batting) is a close 2nd.,9
"5 South Indian states get 3 teams while North only gets 3 with 7-8 states smh my head.

Bolt - it's in the name,5
Well left Rayudu. Build your innings in t20 with a 80 sr,4
How much santner can sit position like that,1
They crowd really thought that was out! So close to the edge,9
MI had peak Malinga and Johnson (+ Coulter-Nile on the bench) in 2013,9

Why is the specialist finisher bowling?,4
"Can't wait for csk to limp to 100/5 after 17 overs and the commentators hyping up a ""Dhoni finish""",14

Bumrahs action looks a little different,2
"Fafs kit looks dope, who's the sponsor?",7
Bumrah is just unplayable right now,7
Bumrah spittin fire,6
So many dots,3

I'd love to go in in a test match with MI's fast bowling lineup,7
Damn the hate for csk dad's are real here,4
Watson seems morose,7
Faf getting nightmare of 2019 test series  (Although Bumrah wasn't there),4
mankad... Lol,7
CSK is the Barcelona of IPL and MI is R. Madrid.,2
Tfw your respite from Boult’s attack is Bumrah at the other end,6
MI and CSKs  powerplays are complete opposites ffs,6
3 Bumrah overs at the death is Lit for mI,3

Sneaky Bum trying to Bum Rush at non striker's end,3

Remember when we had McCullum and Smith and weren't completely dog shit during the powerplays? Good times,5
Rayudu ran 3 ... what is going on,6

Are the Chahars brothers?,3
Running 2s and 3s will make all the thickbois fit again.,6
That is some heavily biased commentary by Gavaskar,5

Wow Virgil Van Dijk flew over to play for Mumbai tonight,5
Holy shit,3
2017 CT final flashbacks,3
I'm sorry... But fuck I know the script. Csk get to 50 off the last 3 overs and Dhoni smacks the living bejeezus out of the death overs to take them home in the last over. I've read this IPL memo several times now.,14
"Bumrah is the only player I'm not mad at when he performs well for MI , don't know why lol",5

Didn’t one of Chahar got corona? How come they are fit and playing again in like 10-15 days after the infection.,3
I hope BCCI makes a nice little tribute video for big MS when he finishes with CSK like WWE made that 'monster' video for Daniel Bryan. Fuck me that entire storyline is one of the best things I've watched in sports entertainment.,2

Wait that kurkure ad Hahah,2

Wow they cut off the ad for the cricket. Hotstar is definitely not Sony,3
"I am kinda low key happy that no one is talking about the three empty stands at the MAC, Chennai.",17
Was that dropped?,3
"To win from here, CSK will be looking to score runs, and not lose any wickets. Mumbai on the other hand must be trying to get wickets and keep the run rate down",13

Both teams are rusty.,10
CONTAGIOUS BAD FIELDING,3

Wtf is this fielding,5
Sloppy fielding from both sides except fap du,2

These guys took the gully cricket ads pretty seriously with their fielding lol,5
sloppy sloppy..,1
What is fielding?,2
damn misfield,1
Hey Boult! Van Dijk is angry now. A header coming at you any moment now.,1
"How many misfields you're gonna witness today?

YES",4
[deleted],9
I've seen this script a few times. CSK will just meander around until they need like 60 runs in 5 overs and then they'll start the fireworks.,3
That daily hunt ad is going to make so many Indians dads to look for remote or turn sideways to avoid eye contact.,2
MI players are mis fielding just to punish Chahar for the hair. Change my mind.,8
It's ok. Been too long without cricket.. I can excuse players for their first match with this absolutely ridiculous pathetic fielding efforts..,9
Rahul chahar lowkey looks like sokka from avatar,10

CSK fielded better than this lmao and all those guys are all 40,5
really proud of mumbai boys for their contribution towards SPORTSMANSHIP^(TM),4
Poor Rahul,2
"Lol everybody has forgotten how to field, this is what a 6 month break does I guess.",2
Can they stop focusing on Chahar pixie's hairstyle already,2
Karma for Chahar for missing that catch,1
Boult just dropped the Win the first match in IPL trophy,3

These fuckers are having production problems but don't fail to pop up their shitty ads every minute,3

"Dayumm

Sourabh Tiwary is the ultimate chonker",3
~~Who will win ?~~  Who will lose?,3
Was half expecting Tiwary to misfield that one,4
I am sure it has been said but Tiwary is an absolute unit!,7
Of course it's 2020.,2
"Wow, just noticed chahar. Indians trying to pull off cornrows",2
Where the fuck is the scorecard,3
Holy shit I thought y'all were memeing about thiccwari but damn is he fat,5
Ada dummy piecegala 😂 super fielding.,2
95/100 off the last 10 here is like getting 120 in the second half of the innings in Indian ground and conditions. It'll take a special knock to cross the line from  this situation.,1
Thiccboi Tiwary,1
"Is Sairabh Tiwari Indias answer to Stoinis. Long levers, big unit.",3
"Bumrah has a face where you think he's going to abuse the batsman any moment, but I have never seen him really do anything more than that.",5

Is it just me or is the score ticker missing suddenly?,10
Misfield is the epitome of cricket,3
What the heck is going on with the fielding?,6
CSK must be feeling home with these empty stadium atmosphere.,4
Rayudu playing some 3 dimensional cricket,7
Tiwary....perhaps I’ve treated you too harshly,8
I P L F I E L D I N G,6
top game from Rayudu,5
Bruh wtf is wrong with TC Sekhar?,12
Rayudu's batswing is gorgeous,10
2018 raydu is back,7
Wtf these weirdos overacting in the Fanzone cam!,15
Rayudu for captain of the Indian team. Screw Kohli.,8
"Rayudu has added 4D batting this IPL, his shots can go through fielders because of the extra dimension in his batting",7
So I wasn't the only one not working out during the lockdown,3
Krunal bowling pies as usual,1
Wah shott bc,2
FML. Even snail paced Rayudu is taking us on,-1
Rayudu scores more than tiwari,3
If CSK can get Ruturaj to open for them... this lineup looks good,2
Rayudu is back in his form,3
Damn rayudu,3
India should have shown more confidence in Rayadu in WC’19. He was really a perfect no. 4,9
Rayudu for #4 in 2023,8
Rayudu be like : 3D my ass!,4
"Someone's been practicing during lockdown

CSK is redefining dad bod.,7
"Damn Rayudu going ham on our spinners, really exploiting the weakest link in MI's bowling.",5
Jew is here folks. I mean dew.,4
This Rayudu looks like a 3 dimensional player.,5
Virtual guest box is pure cringe.,21
Sandpaper inside the pocket.,4
I guess Mumbai's winless streak in uae will continue.,6
All the talk about rustiness makes no sense. It’s not like they haven’t played at all in the last 6 months— the practice sessions never stop,3
Rayudu did Saitama push ups this lockdown.,10
"If Rayudu would've played in the WC, Dhoni would've had his perfect send off",6
>being a Mumbai fan in an even year,7
There's always a few players that you irrationally dislike without any reason. One of them would be Krunal Pandya for me.,11
Why so much ambient noise when there is no crowd?,12
Spinners doing the job for csk again,4
CSK played R Chahar way too conservatively last year.,3
Rayadu has a point to prove.. doing it in fine style..,7
"Is the virtual guest box LIVE? if so, that's rather interesting",6
Faf single handedly driving CSK's average fielding standard higher than MI's,7
"i like how these two are playing. calm and composed, ticking the score board",5
"Pollard doesn't bowl anymore, does he? He was a pretty useful bowler in his initial days.",10

"Rayudu hits a six.... Meh

Faf takes a single... Electrifying fake crowd sound",17

"Fuck the dew, not helping Mi",2
Guys it's looking tough for MI at this point. Unless they do a miracle MI is unlikely to win at this point. Let's see,2
Kunal baby pls take a wicket,3
Its a single relax you sound engineer,19
Bangar on a gaming chair,6
"Just learnt that Bumrah is only 5'10"". Don't know why but I thought he was 6'3"" or something.",9
"fuck these facebook ads

y is facebook (an internet company) show ads on TV??",2
Why isn't hardik bowling.. usually the partnership breaker.,5
White Hat Junior ad is such a blatant exaggeration,1
Surely Hardik Pandya's bowling is more useful than his brother on this pitch?,1
All this Sanjaying in the background is giving me Manjrekar-related PTSD,1
Mumbai is so bad in Dubai! It happened last time too there is something in the air,3
I'm sorry to bring up that match but Rayudu wouldn't have made any difference in the WC semi final. He can barely move his feet against good fast bowlers.,11
"This pair should open. Dont remember the last time Vijay made a match winning contribution . He is basically a filler for an Indian batsman in CSK lineup. May as well give the position to Gaekwad.
Watson is like a 1 in a 3/4 match player. Need more consistency.",6
"Middle-order batsman makes some runs in one innings.

Bumrah's 3 over is key,1
“mAdAmE pLeAsE kEeP tHe pHoNe dOwN” - Hindi commentators,2
I don't know about CSK winning this game! But they've done well for a team with alot of issues!,7
We were having a perfect IPL 2020 with Saurabh Tiwari being the highest run getter. Then Rayudu had to come along.,10
Rayudu is on fire.,3
ALTROZ^TM,2
[deleted],7
Red Altroz is very sexy. Golden is meh,2
We bought Karn for what 6 Crs? I think he's played like 3 matches in 3 seasons,2
Have Hardik bowled yet?,2
"IPL, Bro, you don't have to try so hard. I can live without the fake crowd noises.",3
Why are the commentators on about the ugly car for so long,3
All those who are romanticizing Rayudu in WC ... don't forget why he was dropped.,6
How do you play that from Bumrah??!,2
How tf are they rotating strike so easily,3
Rayudu's go to shot is a dab down to third man. Half decent bowlers like de grandhomme would have got him out pretty quickly on a seaming wicket.,0
How will they stop fans from flashing their dicks on that fan screen?,6
"Must be wonderful being employed by a company that pays crores in sponsorship money to make you look like a complete moron dancing in front of a webcam, broadcast all over the world.",1
"Boult was a very good fielder last ipl with dc, saw him take some great catches",3
Rayudu about to pull out the 3D glasses for celebration,3
A wicket here will make things interesting again,1
what a ball,1
Bumrah is still on track to be the MOTM right now. He just needs to make sure that he goes for less than 10 an over with the ball. His batting clinic will be enough to help him pull through.,-1
Seeing these score lines and bowling figures makes me feel good about my Last Man Standing season,4
Obligatory CSKesque 37 ball 50 on the way,4
"80 off 52. 

Match is on.",5
Almost took off de Kock's head,11
How's the dugout this time around? Should I drop SS1 and get SS Select?,1
And quite the response from Rayudu,6
rayudu u beauty 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍,7
So it's like the fake crowd noise is added in in broadcasting or they blasting it from speakers on the ground?,3
Little shit Curran in next or we riot,14
Rayudu dominating Bumrah. My oh my.,11
Noiceeeeeee,3
Guess which 2 players I didn’t add on my dream 11,39
First fifty of the tournament that's some comeback from Rayudu.,11
They probably put the FIFA world cup’s crowd reactions in the sound,2
Rayudu has looked genuinely comfortable today,14
Thank you for not including vuvuzelas in pre recorded audio,7
Lol rayadu lol bumrah,5
Bc Yorker specialist not bowled a single Yorker,6
MSK prasad switched off his TV,14
Raydu taking the game away shit,5
I like the fact thtat KP casually ignored that car.,3
"""He's a consistent player""




LUL",3
Dancing down the wicket to Bumrah. Woh,5
Wow Rayudu is playing very good. Looks confident too. Wonder why he didn't play for so long?🤔🤔,5
Rayudu mate what was that,5
Who’s commentating right now?,2
Loving how Rayudu and Faf are keeping it classy and making it look easy. Feels like MI were slogging all over the place in comparison,7
Where's Danny Morrison?,1
either dhoni of the old next or send in jadeja,4
Well played Rayudu. First 50 of the season.,7
"With all due respect, I'd take Sanjay Manjrekar's commentary over Sanjay Bangar. Any day.",-4
Rayudu to bumrah: know your place kiddo,9
"Bumrah is the enforcer

Pattinson and Boult are the Powerplay wingmen",5
2018 Rayudu is back,11
Rayudude for #4?,7
Rayudu is the Kmart version of Kohli,4
"Faf is gonna slog and lose wicket,kedar will waste 2 over and get out.


Dhoni in strike with needing 15 of 6",2
Rayadu playing better for CSK than MI.,6
Well played Ambati.,3
Wtf was the dailyhunt ad?,5
Hahahaha... That daily hunt ad is hilarious.,6
KP commentary so often involves saying the same sentance 2-3 times in a row but switching the adjective,6
Chahar is bowling shit,4
Rayudu dammm bro 👐,4
Anyone watching on Hotstar in the US? I’m only getting the Hindi stream.,2
50 RAYUDU WOOOHOO,2
Rayudu you beauty!,2
Rayudu on fire,2
"Nehra in the Hindi commentary box, no one’s watching?",1
The way bumrah bowls i think the ball comes much faster at the batsman than any other conventional pacers. The action makes it very difficult to pick up the length too,1
"Rayudu is playing well, CSK should replace him with a rando who has hardly played ever",11
Rayudu for President of the US. Fuck Biden.,10
Can we have real life Nehra commentate instead of goody good Nehra?,7
Daily hunt ad 😶😂😂,2
"Oh wow, faf's hair looks..... interesting...",0
"Get out already, Rayudu. We want to see Dhenier bat.",-5
Damn Rayudu on a rampage,9
Dude rayudu 💖,6
Oppo ads still showing?,2
/uj: RAYUDU FOR #4,5
"looks like ""not having the pressure of being selected for WC"" can do wonders to u",8
Yikes this match is gonzo,3
Rayudu playing cricket 07 in 3d,9
Rayudu what a masterclass,8
Rayudu making it look easy!,6
Nice shot !,2
Koach may have costed us a wc final by removing Rayudu,6
Shot,4
Holy shit. Rayudu’s on 🔥,5
"Ambati ""Fuck National Selection Panel"" Rayudu",55
2018 rayudu is bac??,5
Hardik and Pollard can bowl right?,5
Gavaskar not praising the single after the six what is happening,11
[deleted],15
"Where was this Rayudu in 2019??

You absolute luckless man.",29
Rayudu is the Sarr to Chahar's Van Dijk.,2
Damn du plessis is so rusty bois,0
"Feels like FAF has been rotating strike on every ball, doesn't face a dot at all.",3
"It’s always a good sign that Rayadu is in form. 

It’s all fun and games when the burly big hitters go fancy but a tournament is about having players like Rayadu on form. I hope this bodes well for CSK.",11
"That moment when Rayudu hots bigger sixes than pollard, hardik",7
Looking way too easy for CSK,5
"RTX OFF: Cricket 07 on easy difficulty

RTX ON: Rayudu today",7
Why's harddick pandya not bowling,2
[removed],3
"I started watching cricket in 2019, and back then Rayudu looked really bad. wtf is this",5
His aggression reminds me of azharuddin,11
Audience sound is getting better,17
COOOOOOOL,4
2018 rayudu is back,4
rayudu lookin hot af rn🔥🔥🔥🔥♨️♨️♨️,6
Hardik - specialist batsman?,3
They should drop Vijay and open with Rayudu,6
C'mon kohli remove your mask and reveal yourself!,7
Bring on Hardik 'might make things happen' pandya,4
Gavaskar is definitely high on some cheap Dubai weed,13
I blame our brainless batting for this. At the 10 over mark we were in the driver's seat. A little more application and we could've gotten to 175 odd. Our middle order choked and the momentum had shifted by then,5
*Yeh lay bc*,4
The fake crowd noise confuses me sometimes. Fools me into thinking something exciting happened,22
Ex Mumbai player taking on Mumbai Indians bowling attack,6
Does hardik have an injury that is keeping him from bowling?,4
For Six literally no crowd sound but for singles crowds go crazy....,13
Yeah baby Jio dhan dhana dhan is the shit. Inject that in my veins.,8
I remember Rayudu debuting (the third season?) in IPL after being banned for few years by the BCCI and sachin wanted share his motm with him,6
"Guys any good whatsapp group for IPL score updates ?

edit :  Not for me, my brother is in ship, he has very limited access to internet so whatsapp group will be easier on data usage.",0
Won't be surprised if Rayudu does an afridi and comes out of retirement soon.,6
Mi could've easily made 200 if they were patient enough at pitch,3
Chennai excels in these type of situations slowly takes the game away from their opposition with smart batting,4
"Ngl, Faf is slaying the colors on his kit.",5
How many ads is Dhoni doing?,2
Mumbai bowling GOAT gang where are you at ?,1
"Do you think the BCCI/broadcasting team asks Sunny Gavaskar and the rest to do eccentric stuff for the audience or is it just them being idiots?

Wtf was that captain Coooooool all of a sudden",11
Insider source tells me Rayadu has been wall batting with the selectors' poster on it all lockdown.,7

Guys sorry if I appear stupid but where is the all audience noise coming from? I can't see much audience. Or maybe I am blind😅,2
Yar. This pre-recorded crowd noise is distracting and annoying.,7
"Subpar form aside, the 2019 chepauk pitch really did Rayudu dirty not even giving him a chance to get back to rhythm",4
Shikar Dhawan telling me about ETF is the weirdest shit ever,8
That was just a big dick energy swing,9
CSK's batting bench strength is practically non existent? Did they get a replacement for Raina?,2
Whoever is managing the audience sound is doing a good job!! It makes me forget that this is being played in an empty stadium.,12
Ugly slog,0
"Hol up

CSK have Hazelwood too?",8
Pattinson must be the fastest off spinner on the planet.,4
">Won 100% cashback on his credit card bill*

*Maximum 100 rupees",24
Why is H Pandya not bowling?,4
Rayudu smashing sixes has already brought this thread to life. The only thing that can top this is if Faf decides to take his shirt off and bat in a towel,82
"Hello, I'm a potato, making Hardik pandya as my captain",8
Is there really dew in a place like UAE?,3
"Man all these screens with people cheering, giving Black mirror vibes",13
nervously sweating now.,4
Fck who remembers that 2D/3D jab by MSK against rayudu ? Looks like that shit happened years ago . I’ve aged so much this year,9
"You fucking dudes made the front page. 

Cricket in India season is truly back.",28
How did that shot didn't get to the boundary? How big is that part of the ground? Jeez...,8
"Commentator: that shot was West Indian

Rayudu: I am a bit on the black side",13
Only Sourabh Tiwari fielding well today,8

"Raydu got back Confidence.

Where the fuck he had gone in 2019",8
Saurabh Tiwari looked big when he was batting. But goddamn looks way bigger on the field now. Heck.,45
"Remember when Dhoni refused a single with 5 needed of 2 against England with Rayudu on the other end ?

Pepperidge farm remembers",21
Ohhhh sanjay being put on the grill in the dugout,10
Which team has the most Aussies? That may get us to 10k+ comments.,10
"Rayudu scoring 💯, will be so much fun🤣🤣🤣",10
Fafda needs to change gears now,4
Bangar being put on the spot about Rayudu. Good “banter”,7
"I hope folks on twitter are reacting to these crowd noise being glitched , hope ipl authorities notice it.",14
Faf with godly 100 strike rate.,11
Commentators are sort of underestimating the Bumrah effect at the death.,8
Tiwari scores most runs and fielded better than bumrah,3
tiwary looking fat af,-1
Lmao Pattinson was appealing for that wtf,3
I swear if they send in Jadhav instead of Dhoni if a wicket falls...,5
"Ok guys one question for everyone, who do you think is the 3D player,if there is any, for each of the teams MI and CSK? Let's see what you all think.

damn I ordered the jersey for a wrong year.,5

Small tremors felt in Dubai and AD when Tiwari fell there....,4

Bangar saying NO as if Watson wouldn't just walk into the Aussie T20 side if he wished to un-retire,1
If we had Rayudu during that SF night hmmmmm,4
Thiccwary covering that leg side boundary all by himself,4
I think I've seen the entire Indian team in these DreamXI ads,5
"Poor raydu if he did this in 2019 IPL

He would have got England ticket.",13
wtf has happened to tiwari!!,3
Gavaskar is a good commentator if he is with a good commentator with a bad commentator like sanjay he stars banter and circlejerking on mumbai indians being champions he was so bad during the last final that I had to switch to regional commentary.,8
I think CSK will choke. It has become a reinforced belief they are shit against MI,-5
"with the amount of big units we have,we should opt to go in for a rugby team.",7
Players are drenched in sweat. Chennai and Mumbai's climate seem like Europe compared to middle East lol.,6
"Bond, Zaheer Khan and Jayawardene -- that is a posh little lot MI have in their dugout.",5
Does anyone have an Ace Stream link for this match?,2
When is Tiwary due?,5
Perfect CSK template match so far.,7
Why did we didn't buy Rayudu again,3
Kohli looks weird in that mrf ad,2
58 off 36 is like the easiest shit ever. A bland opening game is usually a good sign for the rest of the season.,10
Oh wow. Straight to the man.,1
Faf should tee off hereon. He has done well so far. But Rayudu can't do it all himself.,1
"Man Rayudu is doing amazing, but Faf man...his experience shows, strike rotation and all, good stuff....",15
Dream11 ads are annoying now,3
"The fake noise is getting better with time but they are slightly playing it randomly after every shot.

Pretty sure when crowds are allowed they won't cheer every single in the 12th over when hit straight to the fielder with that intensity",15
" wish you Indian fans could see the hair loss product advert we have here featuring Darren Gough and Shane Warne.

so bad / hilarious",19
"Dc vs kxip, personal favourite?",5
wtf why would they dub Kohlis voice? ffs it's cringe,4
How come TataSky HD has better quality than HotStar?,4
Oh it’s time for CEAT tires. CEAT tire strategic time out. 2 and a half minutes for a CEAT tire strategic fix timeout where they discuss strategy in CEAT tire strategic timeout,5
Saurabh Tiwari looks like the bully in a middle school based comedy who would get his comeuppance before the climax and reveal a weepy inner self,10
Drinking game - take a shot the next time some cricketer asks you to enhance your skills through online learning,6
We have to appreciate CSK for maintaining their template year after year without any change.,10
Zak coaching Sharma looks like a bold move.,1
Dhoni in khatabook ad looks so weird,2
What time does Old Aunty praying for MI starts?,10
Faf needs to step up now.,1
Philding kumar from MI is like manifestation of thicc body of Rohit and Saurabh.,2
unable to find hotstar on lg smart tv :(,2
Is Zaheer coming out to bowl?,6
Can someone explain what's up with rayudu and 3d/2d jokes? I don't get the reference,7
"If we can replace Vijay with Gaikwad for next game we will be so much better as a team.

Even if Gaikwad is not available would rather have Jagadeesan playing to Vijay.",7
Thanks to msk prasads epic mismanagement we not only lost Rayudu it probably ended Vijay Shankar's career prematurely he could've been a decent all-rounder if managed properly. Hope he's given another chance,9
Post on r/popular. Nice,2
C'mon Abu Dhabi. I wanted dancing low res gifs of spectators in the seats like EA Cricket.,7
Lyon should try advanced hair studio...or maybe Shaw,3
it’s gonna be a close one,4
Advert timeout,4
How tf Mumbai has so many bowling options,5
Rayudu has got a point to prove this Ipl.,11
Nothing would make me more erect if Bumrah absolutely schools Rayudu this over.,13
concussion substitute ?,3
Raydu hits one on to his face. That's what you call 3D,6
"Interesting for Bumrah to be bowling now. I thought they'd save his 2 overs for the end, especially with no Malinga.",2
This is the top post on r/popular rn,9
First Yorker finally,4

Rohit just fell sideways there he had no idea where the ball was,7
Loving this partnership,2
Why is Pandya not bowling?,5
We're in r/popular now. Cue in incoming Americans asking us to explain what cricket is.,26
3 significant digits in Bumrah's economy column feels horrifying,8
He's in,3
Is it just me or has Bumrah lengthened his run-up?,7
Both these batsmen have odd stances. It seems to be turning the way of Smith,6
It's a cruel joke to have DC and KXIP start against each other. The team that loses will think 'why are we always like this?',81
a run out now is the last thing they want,7
"Gee that's close, Rayudu mate. You gotta stop looking back",9

Looks noncey",6
"Phew, that's close. Get that 100 Rayudu.",2
Hardik Pandya looking like bhuvan Baam character titu Mama,5
It seems bumrah's NZ hangover is not over yet.,5
If he was anymore in he’d reach the G spot,6
this hurts to watch as a bumrah fan,4
The crowd noise ooof,1
Bumrah effect indeed.,1
That moustache on Pandya is making him look like Aam Aadmi,6
Just load it.,2
Why do they have to show stuff on the big screen?,4
That was so damn close!,2
Maybe they should bowl Hardik or Pollard,3
[deleted],5
"Man I've got the worst food poisoning I've ever had, feel absolutely dreadful. This match is the only thing keeping me going at the moment.",13
4-5 matches for bowlers to rev up I guess.,3
I don’t know how cricket works but this is at the top of popular so I’m commenting,16
Yes yes yes,2
Fuck when bumrah fails it feels sooo bad,9
Dully was begging for some excitement hoping for a wicket,4
I'd have loved if they didn't put in the fake crowd noise.,3
Which service can be used to watch IPL in the US?,5
What's the point of being in the richest team if I still have to field?,12

Americans rising up to this weird thing on top of r/popular ...,14
We're the captains now.,2
"""Not just the player who are rusty""",10
Bumrah looks a lot more.... hittable ever since his injury. Some of the mystery in his bowling has worn off too.,5
Bumrah is rusty and So out of touch.,2
"Aah I thought it's a boundary, brilliant save.",5
Dedication™,4
Didn't know Pattinson had it in him to pull that off,3
That was a save ooof,1
Pattinson is giving his everything.,4
Bumrah's been low-key shit today.,12
i had ishan kishan in my fantasy team 😭,5
Feel like pure shit just want Boulto Patto duo back,2
The delayed audience response is giving me serious Brian Lara Cricket 2002 vibes,4
Pattinson really is giving his all. To think so many of us were critical of his acquisition as Malinga's replacement,6
That deserved a crowd cheer. Sound engineer away from desk?,3
"🙏🏼🙏🏼Not sure why I got downvoted for asking about 3d players for both teams, but I apologise if I offended anyone🙏🏼🙏🏼😊",-1

WTF is Chaahar doing just run up bowl normally,3
Now mi are just shithousing,3
No big hitting and 11 runs from this over.,2
I get my pepsi from the store,3
I'm surprised pattinson hasn't broken his rib or his back or shoulder with that dive,3
Can sexy Chrollo change the direction of this match?,2

PUT DOWN. Now that'll be costly,1
delhi is hella scary this year,1
Pattinson went from a topper front bench student to a back beach bully from the starting of his career to this point.,2

fkk rayudu wouldve been out at 69,5
Almost!!,2
Holy fooook,2

Looking forward to see DC. That team has become dangerous. Contenders.,3
Faf is such a valuable player at 3. He looks in good nick.,1
Catches win matches,1
That's an interesting run up from Chahar....cant imagine it's the most comfortable to bowl from,1
Senior Pandya washed up? Joining CSK next season? Subscribe.,4
Something about a leg spinner bowling across the umpire don't sit right with me,2
I think the whole universe conspires to beat us in the first game of every IPL,2
That was a hard catch but would have been sick if he got it,2
Question. can a CSK side win a T20I world cup hypothetically?,4
"You just dropped the game, KP",4
"Wrong Pandya, otherwise it would've been gone",2
"Rayudu experimenting with the shots, had it been caught it would have been a fantastic catch.",2

Cmon that was a dropped catch. Wtf Ajay Devgan !!,4
Shit Bumrah.,1
"I remember this umpire, he was bashed by dhoni last year on field.",3
This fake crowd noise is very irritating.,3
Fielding has been shite from MI today...,4
Lol Saurabh ain't catching that in a million years you're kidding me,3
Wtf CSK is doing?,3
Rayudu trying to be a Madlad.,6
Looked easier in the replay,5
Chahar has been unlucky. Really shit fielding,3
Tiwary is a UNIT,8
Evens now. Chahar dropped one off Krunal. Krunal dropped one off Chahar.,2
Why do the crowds go berserk for goddamn singles smh,3
Krunal Pandya is the most over hyped player Ive seen in recent times . In every gully mohalla you’ll find a middle order spinning all rounder like Krunal in India,3
"Yet another season, yet another first game loss. This feels normal.",2
why didn't he go for the catch,3
R Chahar run-up is interesting!,1
CSK is on suicide mode.,3
It could be a wicket it could be a wicket nooooooo,3
Gotta dive for that SKY,4
A 6 or a wicket ahead in this over,1
4 balls 4 mishit no outs,7
Waiting for Dhoni’s batting,1
"Everything that can go wrong for MI, is going wrong for MI.",4
what a bad effort by yadav,3
This is an epic comeback from 23/2 in 5.4 overs,5
I hate these across the wicket run-ups for some reason. So distracting.,5
[deleted],4
DHONIII,2
Jesus that was a catch,2
Mannnn,1
Csk on suicide watch,1
"Good job Chahar, huge over",2
"Rayudu WTF, don't try to give away your wicket",2
They both looked determined to give him a wicket,14
I think someone's told Du Plessis that Vijay's been off the pitch for more than an hour so he's itching to go back to his room and check on his wife.,13
He deserved wicket in this over,7
Well played Rayudu my guy.,7
6ix9ine got a wicket,6
"Gg wp Rayudu,",3
Whatever Bharatnatyam Chahar is doing has worked some how,2
"Van Dijk, you beast..",4
Chahar took it himself! Quite literally! Well done,1
Why the fuck is nobody going for the fucking catches for fucks sake motherfucker?,3
"Someone caught it.

It was coming, he was itching.",1
Finally,1
Rahul: Fine I'll do it myself,2
Walmart Van Dijk doing the job for us,2
That is a brilliant catch.. well done chahar,2
He was hungry,3
What is this?? A decent catch?? What fucking time-line am I in?,5
Time for Thala 20*(25),6
"Finally, someone could hold on to a ball.",5
Rayudu really wanted to get out this over,6
"Good innings Rayudu, you did your job.",5
Sunny might as well wear a shirt that says 'fuck csk',4
send in Sam Curran,3
Yaaaaaaaaassssss!!!,2
Chahar did the right thing and didn't trust his teammates for that catch.,3
5th chance this over...finally caught,2
M O M E N T U M S H I F T,4
Ideal opportunity for Dhoni to walk in and see his side home,4
mindless batting in the entire over,6
"Remember when Rayudu played for MI?
All I could think watching him bat in 2018 IPL was that he could've been in MI given how shit we were in 2018",2
Harikiri ... no other word for Rayudu... why ?,2
Fuck finally,2
"Chahar had to take things into his own hands, given his teammates’ fielding tonight",4
"Tactical from SKY to not go for the last one so Rayudu would be on strike and Chahar could get him out.

64D underwater backgammony chess",6
"He should've got like 3 wickets this over, well deserved",2
King Chahar 👑,1
Very strange over from a CSK perspective. Terrible batting,5
Chahar looks like Rose from BBL,3
Awesome ball control from VVD there,2
Absolutely clutch from Chahar,3
Fin - fucking - ally.,2
Looks like rayudu saved all his luck for 2020.,5
"Was waiting for so long to shitpost on this sub! Glad to be back.

Rayudu gone. Can't wait for Dhoni to come and finish the game.",4
M'GoodBoy Tiwary out here gonna eat chicken tendies after the match,3
What is this fielding?,4
Iyer just breathed a sigh of relief. Rayudu's century would have been threat to his no. 4 spot.,17
42 of 4 won't be easy.,5
The whole team is drilled with take it deep which is fucked up strategy long term lol.,7
"Fine. I'll do it myself

- Chahar",9
What happened to csk lol attacking every ball,3
Dhoni should be ballsy to walk in now,5
Dhoni to come and take 11 balls to settle and then runout or notout till CSK lose.,7
thank you chahar finally some points,2
Whoever told Chahar to change the angle deserves praise.,4
42 off 24 This game is on the balance,3
Virgil Van Dijk pulled off a stunner.,3
Now why would you do that Rayudu 🤔,4
Rayudu became one of the very few to hit Six to Bumrah,4
Du plessis should have gone for the big shoot Rayudu not you,1
I really wish they stop with the fake cheering ASAP. They should learn something from ECB,1
Chrollo and Hisoka's love child with the sexy use of Bungee Gum for catching. That's not the first time he's done that. Won't be the last.,5
Does anyone feel like CSK was almost trying to lose a wicket here? So many chances and so many times hitting the ball in the air for no reason again and again?,8
"**15.6** Chahar to Rayudu, OUT, **holds onto it himself after sprinting backwards!** Superbly done from Chahar. **121-3**

AT Rayudu c &amp; b Chahar 71 (48b 6x4 3x6) SR: 147.91",3
The coming across the umpire to bowl is genius lol. Will probably take a few deliveries to even know how which hand the ball is coming out from.,3
He was like I gotta do it myself and he did. Also that hair suits him well!,2
I hope MS doesn't fuck this up.,2
It's got to be either Krunal or Hardik now,1
"""This is the first time I've seen a legspinner do that"". I see that Sunny G didn't watch last years IPL.",7
How did Rahul Chahar age by 5 years within 2 seasons?,5
Sending in Jadeja over Curran smh my head,1
"Stage is set for Dhoni. Scratch that, it's Jaddu.",2
Man the team has been disappointing chahar for a while now.,2
Rayudu had been *lumberjacking* for a while now. Expected him to throw away like this,4
Thanks for the memes and the laughs rayudu,9
Nap time for the senior citizens,6
Tf are these ads,1
Tough for CSK.,3
Tf is Jadeja doing here,4
I thought everyone other than faf forget catching.,3
What Jaddu? Surely he is taking the piss,4
Rayudu played very well today. Rayudu you have my respect again from today👍🏽,2
"Damn this got interesting, can they make it !!",2
WTF is that sleepx ad...cringe,1
Bacteria makes you have a threesome? Wtf are these ads,3
Whats about rohit sharma?,1
I will cry if csk loses this match :'(,6
Does anyone else feel like puking while watching the drone follow the batsmen out of the ground,1
Jadeja. Hmm,1
[removed],2
Let’s see if Dhoni has trust in his abilities and comes in himself instead of sending Jadhav,0
"I have been up all night just to see Dhoni bat, and then Jadeja comes in.....",2
"Jadeja vs Boult 2.0

Who'll come up trumps this time?",2
Guys Jadeja has walked out,1
Finally a catch. But that means Jadhav and Dhoni. Fuck.,2
"How this match thread works ,is anyone updating scorecard or its automatic process",2
"Rayudu must have got money transferred message during drinks break, was trying to get out ever since",-3
[deleted],-2
"*I'm sick of no one attempting to take my catches, Fine I'll do it on my own.*",5
Everyone expecting Dhoni and then Jadeja comes in,5
Did an Indian ad just use the word 'threesome'? That's gonna make some conservatives clutch some pearls,2
Dhoni not interested in batting this match,5
Dhoni is playing with everyone,2
"Should bowl Boult now, he's too shit against Dhoni when bowling last over.",0
stage set for Dhoni to take away the credit again,-2
"Pattinson has done well, but needs to finish off economically",3
Chris lynn best bowler,2
Please send thala for a test match innings,0
why is rohit calling ben stokes? he is not even playing.,4
Just the first game. MSD just playing around.,3
Need 42(24).,1
happy dhonis not batting he chokes these,-1
Why Rayudu??? I guess the threat of MI's death bowling makes them go after Chahar?,3
[deleted],5
Dhoni wants to replicate the WC Semi-Final and win this time.,5
El Boulto is pretty bad at the death in general.,7
Jadeja? that's surprising,2
At least Dhoni is self aware he is finished.,-8
400 S/R,4
Jadeja!,2
"Now, we just need CSK to lose the match in the last over for this to be a typical CSKvMI match",8
We gonna see the sword celebration?!!,-1
"Sir Jadeja is here

Game over bois",3
WC Jaddu back at it,3
Sound guy forgot crowd noise on jadeja's 4,7
Let's go,1
Poor delivery,2
Sir has entered the chat,2
Jaddu jaddus the ball,2
Crowd silent for boundaries but shouting for singles,7
THE SWORDSMAN,1
I would simply hit five sixes and win.,4
Now now Malinga will be missed at this point,7
[deleted],4
Jadeja and not MSD?,3
This match has seen some sub par fielding and bowling. Thank God did not open a beer. Would have been a waste of alcohol.,5
Dhoni finally realized that he is not a finisher.,6
"* stopped a top order collapse
* scored 50+ runs at a  healthy run rate
* played spin well

rayudu is the #4 india has been looking for all along",10
Fake crowd goes crazy for a single- silence on a boundary,9
Was expecting Mr StreetSmart™ . I'm let down,3
Faf will be out in the next over and Dhoni finishes off in style,3
Stop bowling leg peg fucks sake,2
"Man of the match: Sound engineer 
/s",5
need the KTK Jaddu,2
"I will tell you why rayudu was so much in hurry, kohli can maintain his shape-shifting power only for so long!!",6
"Fyi pleasantly surprised that the coverage on fox in Aus is ad free. 

Never realised how I much I liked ad free cricket coverage before watching it. Just keeps you in the zone",5
Pattinson looks like a depressed James Faulkner,5
Just not been MI's day. With Boult and Bumrah they should have been in better position,3
CSK going for the classic *Play Deep™*,3
Krunal is going to bowl an over in the death? Fuck,5
"Damn, Dhoni sent Jaddu instead of himself. He really wants to win.",5
Pattinson should've been bowled out earlier. His slow balls are going to be smoked by faf now,1
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/547129288399388682/756877289635053568/FB_IMG_1600523996369.jpg lmaoooo,16
Hate this fake audience background noice.,6
[deleted],35
Will be classic shitshow if Jadeja gets out now and then Dhoni comes in and plays a solid 9 off 18 balls,13
Yo whoever designed the Mumbai Indians jerseys this year.  Needs a raise. 😂,7
y no harddick bowling,0
Am I weird if I was rooting for a Pollard and Rahul chahar collision,3
This haircut and facial hair suits MS no gay,5
Rayudu has cruelly denied Jadeja a chance to get his century by batting so well and for so long,6
Dhoni washing his bat. Washed up confirmed.,7
If CSK loses today it'll be because of Fafda not Dhoni ya fucking dimdums,1
Jadhav looks fucking depressed lmao,2
Dhoni chose jadeja in dream 11 wants those points,11
Lmao did Dhoni dye his beards,0
"Hardik going to bowl the last over, then ? Could be risky.",2
[deleted],-16
What is dhoni trying to grow on his bat handle?,1
Why is Pietersen such a twat,2
The 1st rule of CSK is to never finish the match before the last over,9
Ad free cricket would be one of the coolest things ever,6
CSK will win at exactly 19.2.,48
Fuckin trademark CSK,2
Ball is fixed. Confirmed,2
[deleted],7
Wow,2
Placement,7
Lands in no man’s land,7
This is just Lagan style fielding,5
3 fielders running for the catch and none of them get anywhere near it,3
Dhenier looks like a typical Jharkhand boy now. Full circle.,2
"Krunal still has one, wonder if Hardik will bowl",1
"Sif hits a four and the crowd is silent. Sir gets a single, crowd goes wild. Crowd does not like Sir.",3
CSK has been extremely lucky with the top edges,2
3 fucking fielders,1
Should have caught that,0
Lol they don't want to out Scratchy Du plesis,1
Another 3D gap found,3
A confluence of idjits,2
Ain't no one messing with Faf today,1
ffs do we even have players on the field?,5
Saurabh not even trying XD,2
Pls no faf get a 50,1
Dat Rohit Sharma redundant dive tho,3
"IT FELT SO GOOD WITHOUT THE CROWD NOISE FOR THE FIRST BALL, WHY CAN'T IT BE LIKE THIS FOR THE WHOLE MATCH FFS",3
"How to get away with a half asses loft shot: 

Hit in the middle of two chonky boys.",7
Why? Another chance missed! Sorry if I am being harsh on MI but that should have been taken!,2
Is that Saurabh Tiwary? He looks like the local uncle who turned up to play with the school kids.,6
Faf cant drop or get out,2
That Sam Curran strike rate 😍,4
"Lol MI. 

I thought CSK is the worst fielding side but MI is really taking the cake.",5
Damn,1
"One less Vada Pav last night, he might have caught that.",5
VILLAGE,3
"FFS Someone take Du Plessis's catch, the man wants to check on his wife and save his marriage before Vijay makes a move.",14
Amazing drop by Mumbai Indians. Not an easy drop.,5
That was Tiwari's catch,3
Anyone instead of Saurabh Tiwary and he would have taken it,7
Was that Tiwary's catch?,1
"Experience bc

- Dhoni probably",3
Saurabh LMAO,2
someone count how many singles Faf has taken this innings.,2
Jaddu <3,1
Saurabh Tiwafi was the one that should have taken that.,2
Triangle of trust fielding,5
jad!,1
Jaddu 🤤❤️,1
3D chess by MI not catching Fafda. That 44 off 39 is winning them this match.,6
"Wide and high full toss

What a shit ball",1
Tiwari ji watchu doing ?,6
Felt like Chennai’s defense was really breaking up,3
Thank you pattinson,2
Terrible ball to bowl.,2
"This kind of luck is very normal for even year MI. In odd years, there's a fielder there.",14
Another poor delivery,1
casual,3
Glad to see Rohit diving wasn't affected by the lockdown,6
Jaddu means business.,3
[deleted],5
Being an Mi fan can be unhealthy for your heart,5
saurabh is thicc ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°),7
Is there a lot of dew?,4
"If MI loses, the fielding is only to blame",6
Something wrong with my eyes. I am seeing everyone wider.,10
What a shit.show from Pattinson,5
With all due respect Pattinson and Boult aren't good death over bowlers,7
Very smart of Dhoni to send the left handed Jadeja it makes it difficult for the bowlers to bowl a consistent line.,8
Both the teams are trying to lose the match lol,9
Yass jaddu,1
Maybe if they all weren't fat as fuck they'd get to some of these. CSK fielding being so much better will be the difference here,7
How many of y’all think that you can beat Rohit in a 400m race?,17
Tiwari has gained so much weight wtf,15
Was that lord shardul,4
"MI's expectation - Dhoni comes in, scores 4 (10)

MI's reality - Jadeja comes in, scores 10 (4)",61
MI need one of those special Bumrah overs in the death. Less than 6 runs conceded.,5
"kedar jadhav, sam curran, ms - thats my choice for next up",4
There is a Krunal Pandya over left :(,7
"Sourabh Tiwary and Rohit Sharma's fitness finally costs MI, they could have reached the ball especially Sourabh Tiwary.",2
Only a Bumrah masterclass can save MI here.,5
Tiwary probably high on vada pav,2
Pattinson did a very good job overall.,3
"Not supporting Mumbai, but want a wicket to fall. Want to see Dhoni come out and try to slog from ball one. Would be interesting",7
Jadeja is sent in because MI still have Krunal to bowl one over,1
"Fake audience sound is interesting. Annoying in a way. But would be super boring without it as well.

There'd be no emotions without the audience.

Do the players also hear this fake sound?",4
Hardhit will bowl now.,1
I feel rohit sees his future in tiwari that is why he is good to him and giving him chances.,1
Critical over. I hope we get 15-16 runs.,0
Watch Krunal get butchered.,0
Please bowl Hardik and not Krunal,1
"Krunal against Jadeja? RIP. Should have bowled Hardik

Edit: This did not age well",0
Big over this,1
Take that Kohli. Take that Shastri. Take that MSK!,4
Tiwari was almost skinny back in 2012. Skinny to obese in 2020 as an athlete? Wtf.,1
What's wrong with the other Pandya?,3
No over from Hardik?,1
Why isn't hardik bowling?,1
I really feel they should be playing Ishan Kishan instead of Tiwari. Tiwari batted well but he seems like a weak link in the fielding which all teams will target. Can't afford that at this level.,2
Just review it ffs,0
MI fielders should use Tiwary as a trampoline,8
"I swear to God this feels like cricket 07

Crowd before the ball hits the rope - silent

Crowd after - ""BDHSGEGWTWTR1GQVA""",11
Excellent change,2
Jadeja is not taking any chances with Vijay in the hut.,3
Classic Mumbai Indians first-half-of-tournament sloppiness.,6
Chennai always take it to the end lol. Be it 100 or 240.,8
This is the over for CSK.,3
Dhoni still won't come to bat,4
Hahahaha,1
Scenes when Dhoni sends Curran in instead of himself,8
Wow..and you think jaddu would have known what a left hand spinner will bowl..,4
"I hate krunal Pandya , he does this thing quite frequently",5
Plumb,1

Oh no. Yes wicket has fallen. But that means MS vs spinner.,2
Krunal: YA R/CRICKET! TALK NA!,3
"Yass now dhoni can finish it off
Edit: never mind",3
Comeon Thala give us a classic 5 off 12,9

That’s not very sir of you,5
Ok so Tiwariji was in on the 4D chess move !,1
Perfect time for Dhoni to come in. CSK got this one in the bag.,3
I don't hate Dhoni or anything but I think it would be great entertainment if he fucks it up,5
Careless Jaddu! To Krunal Pandya of all bowlers!,1

Would love to see dhoni finish this off with a 6,5
He actually sent in Curran lol I was joking about it,46
why tf Dhoni not coming out yet,9
Okay. What actually happened during drinks break?,2
That Lenskart ad is funny as hell,1
Laxmipathy Balaji looks so sad there. Feel for the man,2

"Dhoni come out, we just wanna talk",2
Dhoni injured or scared?,-1
Wtf thought dhoni was going to come in. Looks like they're deviating from the script,0

Ummmm. No Dhoni bro? This shit won’t fly :/,3
Sammy to the rescue,5

Why the fuck is Krunal going for Yorkers,3
Krunal is the slowest fast bowler.,9

Dhoni's finished the match for CSK without even coming out to bat.,8

That’s more like Krunal.,7

"Curran just coming from Aus-Eng tour, he's match fit. Good decision by CSK actually to send him first",8

Krunal Pandya is too fast to be a spinner and too slow to be a pacer. Hence he is cannon fodder.,4
Masterstroke by dhoni to make Britishers watch ipl!!,9
Need a Bumrah special here,1
I swear Dhoni reads this sub and constantly tries to piss us off,9
Lol dhoni knows how to use himself. A specialist keeper,13
Dhoni will only khelo Dimaag se this season,5
What's Dhoni afraid of? Hasn't he already got his yellow pants on?,5
I am all for Krunal as a bowler but giving him the 17th over isn't a good call IMO. Spin in the death overs doesn't usually work.,4
Rohit took a page out of Morgan's playbook,8

MI fielding has been such garbage today,3
"r/cricket and broadcasters: That's stupid. Makes no sense

Fleming and Dhoni: What if we use 100% of our brain",27
Sorry if this has been answered before... But why is Hardik not bowling?,9

Petition to change the name of Sam Curran to Sameer Karan.,14
"Game is over
Unless csk does something stupid
Rohit allowed them to have a chance",3
Dhoni may not be the finisher anymore but you can never question his cricketing brain. He simply gets it when it comes to match situation and strategy.,10
Bumrah with his Trademark special or ultra level Shithousery. Nothing inbetween..,6
Select HD is not ad-free anymore ?,4
"I'm going to be downvoted to oblivion, but here's my opinion --

Dhoni does a better middle order than Kohli.",5
England may not realize it but MS may groom the best finisher for England along with Stokes.,12
Krunal has been absolute trash for 2 seasons running now. They need a better spin bowling all rounder.,4

His dick is too big; when he runs in, it slaps against his knee and throws him off his rhythm",23

16 runs 2 overs is EZ but with Bumrah and Boult there is still a major doubt no?,1
MS are you cumming?,0
"Why did we let him go? -,-",5
I am not gay or anything but I Sam Curran right now...,9

Bumrah is shit lmao,-1
Wew thanks pattinson. A wicket for Bumrah,5
Does Curran know the difference between India and (Mumbai) Indians,15
Sam Curran always is the nemesis,7
Pattinson has been our best fielder today,7

Ok Bums. We need you prepared for Australia. Plz,6
Pandya was standing way ahead,2

Curran's not married yet but he's still not taking any chances with Vijay in the hut.,6
Send Lungi just to fuck up r/cricket,10

"Curran has done his job there, it's what he was sent in for and it worked",10
"Pattinson: fine, I’ll do it myself",6
What's with all the length balls from MI? Haven't seen a single Yorker from Bumrah yet,0
Come on Dhoni. Don't lose it. Sodhappadha,3
Feels too late now,2
Misbah and Sreesanth-esque.,3
We expected Dhoni to be finished but it’s Bumrah who is lol.,0
Bumrah will have to deliver a special over here to save this one,1

And ofcourse Dhoni out to score the winning runs,2
"Now, are we going for the 19.4 meme?",4
"Good catch, for a second I thought it was Tiwary",1
I will take this Sam curran innings over any Dhoni slow start and maybe 3 boundaries in the end.,3
Rishabh Pant is that you??,2
Finally!,1
Curran fulfilling his duty of getting the runs in the bag then getting out so Dhoni can score the winning runs,10

Wonderboy Curran™  has been haunting Indians ever since his debut Test. Done his job and MSD's,11
"Job done, time for Dhoni.",8

Another wicket pls. Let's have a good match,2
Damage is DONE!!,5
So who clapped for Dhoni?,5
Man I love Dhenier but a golden duck would be hilarious,6
"Will the players feel the same pressure without the audience sounds? They're playing ""Dhoni Dhoni Dhoni"" audience chants.",6
player is absolutely useless for his team but suddenly they become legends by playing for csk. We've seen too many players like this i wonder whats up with csk management?,10
I am late to the party but are the pre recorded crowd chants playing on speakers in the stadium?,7
"He gonna tuk tuk, i swear",4
All the players involved in that dismissal belonged to the PIG3 teams. Another PIG3 conspiracy discovered.,3
WTF Umesh Yadav in bumrah mask,3

Jeez trashprit... Stay the fuck away from them Vada pavs bruh.,2
Damn Bumrah is just so awful now,3
Genuinely concerned about Bumrah. Bowling tripe.,4
BUmrah has been trashy,3
"If Curran can do the job that Albie Morkel used to do for us, we are in good shape.",6
"Well, Curran played match winning 50 with 180+ S/R (iirc) for KXIP last season, and hat-trick as well. But apart from those 2 matches, he didn't do much.",4
Has Bumrah forgotten the yorkers?,3
Ok this fan reaction after each boundary is cringy,5
MI can still hope as long as Dhenier is here,3
"Bumrah has bowled complete pies this match.. no rhythm, no pace, no Yorkers..",3
"One thing is certain Sam Curran loves Indian bowling, be it - India or Mumbai Indians. (Yeah 2018 series still hurts) Brilliant short innings by Sam Curran.",9
RIP Bumrah hype train,8
"LoL good shot , bumrah is being taken to cleaners today. Finish the match in this over",6
It’s all fun and games until u realise all Indian cricket team players played super shit today (except Jadeja),1
He hasn’t even tried a yorker.,5
Bumrah bowling like a club bowler,2
Dhoni pls take strike,1
"so we won't be seeing (hearing) the ""DHONI DHONI DHONI"" chant this year?",1
6 from 9,1
Seems like the Hammering Bhuvi got in the opening game of IPL 2016. MI champion and Bumrah Purple cap confirmed.,1
Dhoni finishes off in style... by standing on the other side!,3
Single and then a Dhoni sixer to end it,2
Bumrah doesn't seem like himself tonight,2
Gow many  different fantasy cricket app ads do we have ?,2
"Rohit: Can you bowl some yorkers, you know, what you are popular for?

Bumrah: Well yes, but actually no.",9
"""The PhonePe app cannot be used to pay fines at a police station or to an individual police officer"".

Looks like they only thought about their ad after they'd shot it lol",7
The crowd cheers are so cringe,2
Wtf Bumrah,3
Why are people are so salty towards Dhoni? Every decision he has made has paid off...,12
Dhoni will be MoM for his 0(0),3
Wow what an off day for Bumrah!,1
Good innings from Faf,1
Bumrah hasn't been the same since that back injury. Hurts to say that.,1
Dhoni taking the finisher thing way too seriously,6
What the hell is wrong with Bumrah and his yorkers?,2
Is it just me or does Dhoni look quite overweight.,1
What is Dhoni gonna do?,1
Bumbrah is trying a bouncer but the pitch isn't meant for bouncers. Needs to go back to the yorkers or a slower delivery for variations.,1
Duck or a boundary now watch,1
Watch Dhoni bring this down from 10 from 11 to 10 from 4. */s,2
Someone give a headband to Bumrah,3
Bumrah lost us the match,1
"Well played faf, delivered under pressure. Take a bow",2
"If dhoni finishes it off , mi fans have to hide somewhere from csk fans",2
"Bumrah until 2019: Strong doge

Bumrah in 2020: weak doge",4
Where is bumrah's  trademark Yorker?,1
"Just a shite day. Poor fielding, Bumrah dishing length, Krunal losing it... lol",2
Same old. Same old for mumbai's first game.,2
Bumrah pls don't fizzle out. It's been like this for like a year now,1
Thala hits a winning 6 & trolls haters like a boss,1
Bumrah just an average bowler now,0
WTF is the point of hotstar premium if I'm still one ball behind or is it only on dugout feed?,5
"2 blocks, and let Du Plessis do it.",3
"To all the DC, KXIP, RCB fans - 


This is why we cannot win the tournament. We will never see a player like Curran coming in and winning games for us from the first match itself.",11
Thalaaaaaaaaa please finish,3
"Death, Taxes and MI losing their season opener.",7
Hattrick incoming,3

[removed],22
One frustrating thing for people who don't support CSK and MI is that players who played for other teams almost invariably do better when they join CSK or MI than they did earlier. Every. Single. Time.,20
19.2 prediction was spot on!,5
Who's winning tomorrow folks? DC or KXIP,2
Whistle podu,3
Gg wp CSK👏🏼👏🏼,5

Dhoni with his 0(2)* to boost his average. Selfish player. /s,22
Oh no handshakes allowed?,3
MI will win this IPL. This loss is what jump starts the trip to victory.,8
Lol where’s the dude who predicted 19.2,19
"✓ Rohit scores more runs than Dhoni.  
✓ Bumrah takes more wickets than Tahir.  
✓ Pandya brothers take less than 3 wickets.   
×  CSK scores more sixes than MI.  
✓ Batting first team scores less than 170.  
×  CSK starts the season on winning note.",8
Bumrah ka first over panauti thi,4
I am dead inside.,1
Salty about CSK win but really happy this MI bowling lineup is not that special like many fans claimed earlier,6
I guess we are winning against MI after 4 losses last season.,15
This is CSK's 100th win under MS Dhoni's captaincy. He becomes the first captain to win 100 matches for a team in IPL.,35
So that’s how it feels after defeating MI?,13
"MI field placement today - deep on the leg, close in on the off

"Great start to the season. Look lot more balanced with Chawla and Curran in the XI compared to last season.

Gaikwad coming for Vijay gonna only strengthen the XI. Hopefully his aggressive batting addresses the cautious powerplay batting. Otherwise perfect game from us.

Those Delhi fuckers better win tomorrow and not experiment with the lineup.,16
my hunger for shit posting on a live thread is still not quenched if I wanna put it mildly,20
Dhoni does this often. He uses situations like this for training of his players for the more important matches in the playoffs. He has the balls to take the criticism if it fails too. Class act.,66
Other than Ceat no sponsor of the current IPL was even in existence during the first IPL.,19
So the noise was piped in the ground.,1

Man they are talking more about Dhoni sending Curran at 7 than they talked about Curran actually hitting those sixes. smh.,69
Why didn't Pandya bowl? His back is that bad?,8
Faf anchored their innings and took 3 catches. He should've been MoM I feel.,15

Sam Curran is MoM?",12

I hope CSK retain Sam Curran before the next big auction. He's gonna become a gun,21
Star Sports going on about Dhoni's return and ignoring the contribution of Chawla. Happened in the mid innings show as well.,17

"The team with the worse fielding lost. Both were terrible, but MI were just too happy to be playing to care, I think.

Curran was great, Rayudu was great, du Plessis was solid. Also nice to see Saurabh Tiwary having a bat.

The broadcast was pretty bad. Gavaskar's commentary was just as bad. Also, Dhoni led well - as he does - but he scored 0\* (2), so the folks at Star would really be better off talking about the guys who played well than try and suck up to Dhoni as much as they did.",41
