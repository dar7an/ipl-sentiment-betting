Yes our management is retarded, yes our selectors are retarded but Jaiswal has been dead weight. We should back him but it's too late this year. Our IPL campaign is on its death bed and the only way to survive is to win matches which isn't happening if Yash is playing.


Jaiswal perforned in the U-19 world cup which was 50 OVERS. IPL is T20. He needs to be backed in the domestic circuit until he performs better in T20s.

It's a serious Stat which emphasises how poorly he builds his innings and how adverse the impact his innings has on the final outcome.
