"All the previous losses were just for the memes. Everyone had a good laugh and we moved on. But its getting a bit more serious now, boys. Hoping to god that my Ginger helps us to finally break the losing streak today.",5
The sandpaper derby,92
I am very excited.,5
RR pls don't choke.,5
"Hard to see Smithy scoring any runs, Marnus already made 167 for Queensland today which means all Smithy's powers and energy have already been drained.",7
Guys I gotta make my dream 11 gambling team.... Will Stokes play?,6
"Just worried about our 5th bowler. I hope Vijay Shankar makes it back into the side.

It is better to have a decent pace bowler than part-time spinner who would be crushed.",3
Fear the Khan,3
Who and what is a Devudu Warner?,6
Kartik Tyagi outperforming seniors like Mavi and N'koti üî•üî•üî•,2
"If stokes plays frm today n is in even half the form he was in last summer

I m backing Rr as the fourth team

Cant trust Rcb",2
Pretty confident that we won't bottle it tonight. Halla Bol!,7

Srh looks poised to win this,4
Miss the times when EXPO 2020 Dubai was our main sponsor and not TV9 Bharatvarsh,3
Ben Stokes üç∫,8
Jaiswal please turn up. It personally hurts me when you don't do well. Thanks,9
"Buttler, Jaiswal, Samson, Smith, Stokes, Vohra, Tewatia, Archer, Gopal, Tyagi, Rajpoot

RR should win if they play this lineup. Has enough batting and bowling depth.",5
"With everyone just looking forward to the mi vs dc game, I don't think enough fucks are gonna be given about this one. Hope it's a banger though.",5
We out here! ^to ^lose,2
"So many stars like Warner, Baristow, Rashid, Williamson, Archer, Smith, Butler, Stokes but not enough Indian stars on either side.",10
"KP with the hot take. He wants Smith to be dropped for Stokes.

Did he just become enemy number 1 for every Aussie?",18
Is stokes going to replace Curran as one of the 4 overseas? Obviously not Smith and surely not Buttler or Archer,3
"Just realized its Warner and Smith as captains 

:x",6
"srh batting, congrats srh",6
Is BC in?,3
Hopefully RR wins for the sake of the tournament,8
Pleasantly surprised how BCCI has managed to get the IPL done safely,11
3D player is in,4
Robbie wtf why?,1
Finally 3D is playing again lmao,5
"jaiswal out, utthapa in",3
Lmao uthappa and riyan parag are back,4
Oh.. Vijay Shankar is in... I'd better go get my 3-D glasses to watch the match..,6
Sad for jaiswal,3
Must be such a killer for Jaiswal's confidence play 2 get dropped,3
Looks like 3D is in,5
Why is Samad out? Inconsistency?,1
"Can't wait to see world cricket's best all rounder back on the ground. Cricket has definitely missed Vijay Shankar.

Stokes is back too apparently",102
RIP rajasthan,2
Good to have Vijay Shankar in the squad. A little relief in terms of our 5th bowling option.,3
"Smith doesn't even remember which players are coming in. 

lmao this guy doesn't give a fuck about IPL in general/

RR should throw him out next year, retain Jofra and Buttler",1
Why do they insist on playing Robin and leave the top U19 batsman out after 2 bad matches?,5
Kohli must be so delighted his favourite person Ben Stokes is playing today,3
STONKS HAS ARRIVED,3
Noooo Jaiswal fuck off RR. Pathetic team. Hang on to your single trophy victory led by a narcissist,4
Glad Stokes is back but not against us. I hope playing in the 2pm heat in Dubai is something his body is not yet prepped for.,1
riyan parag Vs priyam garg lmao,9
This is an ideal ground for Kanos mama,3
The legendary uthappa is back..,2
Imo dropping Jaiswal is a good decision. No shame in waiting for him to get better after a year or so.,15
You why tf did they bring jaydev undhakat.  Fucker is worse than aaron,1
I am starting to develop an irrational hatred for Uthappa. Go back to Cricbuzz so I can like you,3
Unpopular Opinion : 3D jokes are getting lamer,23
"RR taking one step forward and two steps back. Fucking Uthappa, he's a dead weight.",3
This IPL is so simple . Bat first and win,6
Vijay Shankar dude you need to rise up to the occasion man. Apart from Manish SRH management has shown so much trust on your talent. But you have not made any significant contribution with both bat and bowl. Hopefully you will prove me wrong.,10
"Hope Robin Uthappa gets a chance to open. As a KKR fan, Robin was very important for us back in 2014-15. Couldn't hate him after the most unselfish innings he played when Rohit Sharma scored 264.",4
Wanted them to trust on Samad and Abhishek to bowl 4 overs despite the Pooran's onslaught but fine with 3D Shankar coming in. I was worried they would do something really stupid like bringing in Fabian/Holder for Kane.,10
"Well uthappa is back, probably his last chance, really really hoping he plays even one miracle innings. Sad to see players go from amazing to jokes in a couple of years.",7
"Can't wait to see the battle of elites

Archer vs Sharma 

Stokes vs Shankar 

Bairstow vs Uthappa",6
Kanos looking sharp,6
Still feel SRH needs to play Billy Stanlake. Don't know how they'll get him in the team.,2
Has anyone noticed Warner always wins the toss and Kane always looses it,8
Loooool Uthappa back in,2
So 4 changes for RR? Is it one of the highest?,3
"Playing Devil's advocate here. 

Yes our management is retarded, yes our selectors are retarded but Jaiswal has been dead weight. We should back him but it's too late this year. Our IPL campaign is on its death bed and the only way to survive is to win matches which isn't happening if Yash is playing.


Jaiswal perforned in the U-19 world cup which was 50 OVERS. IPL is T20. He needs to be backed in the domestic circuit until he performs better in T20s. 


Also Fuck Uthappa, should've opened with Vohra or Shashank Singh",15
Warner bunny vs chad Archer upcoming,6
"Does RR's Indian players team selection makes any sense?

They are playing roulette with them.",6
I look down upon anyone who uses TikBook. Sorry Devudu Warner,10
I can understand dropping Yashasvi. But is Uthappa really the answer? At best he can anchor a chase of 130-140 IMO. The last two dismissals I‚Äôve seen in this ipl were perfectly timed shots but they barely reached the fence.,4
When you have a shaky top order there is nothing more comforting than Ben Stokes at no 5,33
Make him Rashid Reddy and give him citizenship already,15
Fuck those are some long ass legs...,4
Any link to watch the match online?,0
"Backing Jaiswal now could hurt playoff chances. See what the foolishness did to Kumble yesterday when he sent a youngster in with more experienced batsmen left to close the game. First target playoff, then worry about Jaiswal.",14
"If RR lose this, IPL will be essentially a five-horse race for four spots this early in the tournament.",8
Let's see which Ben Stokes shows up today : 2018-2019 IPL Stokes or England post wc19 Stokes,5
**SANDPAPER DERBY**,18
Jaiswal struggled against the express bowling of Rabada and Northje but I think he would have been more at home againt 125-130 kmph of our bowling. Still dropping him is understandable but why drop Mahipal Lomror who looked really good couple of matches back. Swapping Parag and Lomror continously won't do either of them any favor. And Uthappa's inclusion is even more inexplicable.,6
First 2 games - SamsOn                                                                  Every other game- SamsOff,38
"RR should've stuck with Aaron. Atleast he was able to create a few chances on that flat pitch in Sharjah, unlike Unadkat who with his shitty slower balls gets smashed everytime.",13
If you don't support us when we're 0-4. Don't support us when we're 0-5.,62
"Steve Smith seems like an asshole for dropping Jaiswal... for a mild mannered guy, I think there's a lot of nastiness underneath",-7
"Sure, Yashasvi struggled but after continuous failures from Robbie who is incompetent and not just with the bat, in the field too, why not let Manan play up top? Robbie is anyway going to struggle in the middle",5
Ok but hear me out. Stokes as an opener...,15
"Lomror dropped two innings after his 47 against RCB? That's ice cold, RR.",25
"Haha Big Ben is back, IPL trophy here we come /s

Ok but seriously, if Rajastan's situation wasn't as dire as it is now I reckon we would've given him a few days to get back into the game, but circumstances dictate otherwise. I predict that he'll be a little rusty today but you never know.

I'm a little worried by Unadkat's return, it's not like we have other good options but he's a liability atm with his bad form. I also just discovered that he's only 28, feels like he's been around forever lmao.",6
It‚Äôs 3 am rn hofefully we get a dub,3
Why the fuck are we playing the chutiya unadkat ffs bc,1
"Including Stokes is a good decision even if he hasn't played in a while. His exploits over the past year have just made everyone believe that the game is never over and to fight till the last ball. 

RR need some of that belief.",4
Looking forward to Archer vs Warner again,4
Steve Smith looks entirely dead behind the eyes in his line up photo.,3
Imagine how bad Varun must be feeling ... getting replaced by the money launderer,2
"Unpopular opinion, but Stokes in T20s is very overhyped. It is his worst format by a significant distance.

I mean he is still very good but I don‚Äôt think that he will be the matchwinner that RR want him to be.",11
"Halla bol!

T: war cry of Rajasthan.",5
"Till two days ago I'd have considered this match a snoozefest, but with Bairstow-Warner's recent explosive partnership and Stokes coming back, I'm actually pretty interested now.",3
"Lol, Uthappa is back. Should have just stuck with Jaiswal instead of him. RR thinktank is almost as bad as the KXIP thinktank when it comes to selection.",8
Rr is basically smith buttler archer stokes and 7 other blokes,36
wtf warner wearing over his arms,3
Smith persisted with unadkat last year as well and repeating the same mistake again this year chutiya,8
"As an England fan, this game is to my liking",12
Barbies wasted a good team last year and they are looking to do the same this time!,2
"Uh oh

Step 1;
1) Get off strike and give it to bairstow Warner 

Warner is archers bunny",15
Jofra to take Warner‚Äôs wicket in 3rd over,7
Warner vs England quicks is a fun combination,8
Archer has Warned dialed in lol,8
"Come on Warner, hit the shit out of Archer",6
"PP is important to score they saying, I see jofra bowling atleast 2",2
KP gets a hard on when players run between the wickets,9
I still think that an IPL team should buy Stuart Broad just to give him 1 over to Warner twice a season and then let him sit on the bench for the other 12 matches.,61
KP is back haha I N T E N T,7
"I can't bear another day of KP's ""intent""",4
Let it go KP. CSK is a team of retirees and these two SRH openers are at the peak of their international career.,10
This is an England v Australia game,44
"This is like an Overseas Premier League Match - Warner, Bairstow, Kane, Rashid and 7 other dudes vs Buttler, Smith, Stokes, Archer and 7 other dudes",12
Just play out Archer,5
2 balls into the game and KP is like: gotta roast them oldies for last night's botch!,3
BUNNY ALERTüö®,5
This DC vs CSK ad is super funny,3
"Should bowl any England player RR have to Warner.

Archer? Definitely. Stokes? Sure. Buttler? Why not. Curran as a sub? Fuck it go on then",13
If RR make Uthappa come at 4 again they deserve to lose,4
Teams batting first have won 20/25 matches this season,2
"Is KP so focused on Archer because he is RR‚Äôs marquee player?

After all someone in a marquee could be said to be ‚Äúin tent‚Äù",4
Phew...one out of four overs of doom are out of the way. I don't care if Jofra goes for 8 runs across his 4 overs provided he gets no wicket.,10
"Hoping Bairstow is still in when Stokes comes on too bowl.

Not often you get the chance to see a battle of the Gingers in 40 degree heat.",8
Wow Dugout was surprisingly sooo wholesome! Lovely,6
The contest is between Riyan Parag and Priyam Garg.,9
Samad is dropped :(,2
Has Stokes played a white ball match since the WC final? Can't remember if he played any of the white ball matches vs NZ or SA,7
"This is how to open against these two pace at Warner leg spin vs bairstow

Hoping to see buttler take rashid apart later hoping for runs for sanju as well",1
why is there a caterpillar on Warner's face?,10
All the teams changing their teams left and right and you guys call koach RTG. so unfair.,1
"Smith telling warner's weakness to archer.

Bairstow advising warner how to play archer.

Ipl is love.",61
I want some cake too,7
Would be absolutely crazy if RR start bossing everyone around with Ben Stokes in the team.,24
"Based on the first 2 overs and my tendency to chat shit, I'm saying that this is no more than a 140-150 pitch",5
Gopal reminds me of the Rahul Sharma dude somehow,1
why are those sheiks behind the bowler,3
Gentle reminder to upvote this match thread .,1
When a team starts depending one individual (Stokes) and expects him to start with all guns blazing then you know that team is struggling,6
Stokes bumping YJB is what this match needs.,8
"Lord Uthappa back..., Also Riyan Parag.

I hope they do good today",2
"I really don‚Äôt like long delays like that in the middle of overs. 

It shouldn‚Äôt take a spinner like Gopal 90 seconds to bowl a ball.",1
RR looks like they planned every over,2
"England fans, would you rather have a Cook who is good at only format of the game or KP who's equally good at all formats?",1
Shankar > Stokes. Change my mind.,5
Bangar cake cutting has me craving,2
Good strategy to just play archer out,0
SRH strategy not to lose wickets till tea,7
Ahahah we are screwed aren‚Äôt we,2
Just get through to tea boys.,9
Behen strokes is back.,10
Fuck this is good from Archer,2
Bairstow might do something stupid here,1
"Wtf do they see in Uthappa his career is over he was already a Commentator they could have persisted with Jaiswal he's young and will give him experience.
Or Open with Samson and Butler followed by Smith and stokes with the likes of Lomror, Tewatia, Parag to follow.
They are missing Rahane can they get him back in mid season transfer.",1
"Jofra joining that elite club of Lee, Akhtar and Bond",0
Jofra steaming in.,2
SMH could‚Äôve been a lovely maiden,5
You fuckin bitch you cost me important fantasy points there with that misfield.,3
Wait.... So they are playing Uthappa and not giving a *single fucking chance* to Manan Vohra?,4
Some proper FAST bowling in this over from Jofra. Fire and venom in every ball.,4
"Runrate 1.7 , guys I don't feel good about today's match",5
Bc maiden jaa rha tha,1
"Jonny, your test contracts gone, I‚Äôm sorry, you can‚Äôt use the IPL to try and get it back",2
Ruined the perfect over,3
Tewatia the God,3
"Both batsmen looking solid, bowlers in good form. Batting team should focus on not losing wickets till lunch. Post lunch session will become crucial.",2
How can RR be so shit with Archer and Buttler two of the best t20 players at their peaks,4
"**Jofra Archer in Powerplay this season**

11-0-60-3

Economy of 5.45",19
Good to see test cricket again,3
"What a disgusting bouncer that was. If Bairstow hadn't moved it would have hit him dead in the forehead.

I thought RR bowled really well last game too, they just batted like absolute specials yet again.",-2
Archer for me,1
Fuck this ground is big.,7
"I fear Tewetia will never be able to  do anything close to his assault in Sharjah, he needs to save up all the IPL money",3
"The SRH medium pacers are gonna be hard to get away on this if they bowl decent lines

Very slow wicket",0
"That shot got us 1? They are not showing intent, drop them. /s",5
Looks like a 150-160 pitch,3
KP talks like an imposter,3
This RR lineup with Stokes looks ominous,1
Okay so this not a batting wicket,6
This is 140 par I reckon,4
Yo what the hell are some of these changes. Like seriously why would you create so much uncertainty within the players like that?,1
"I don't care what anyone says. Jofra>Bumrah for now at least. VERY similar stats in the World Cup, which was Jofra's first real series. Archer is unquestionably better this IPL and is even slightly faster.",19
Warner playing slog sweeps. End is nigh.,1
Jee this pitch is so slow. That stopped on the way to Warner,4
"**Warner v Archer**

Tests : 3 dismissals, 8.67 avg

ODIs : 2 dismissals, 14.00 avg

T20Is: 2 dismissals, 6.00 avg",12
How come few supporters are sitting in ground or they are part of team owners or something like that.,7
"Win or not, I am excited to see Ben play",13
They need atleast 160 with khaleel and shankar as the main bowlers,6
My KP fatigue is setting in early today.,7
Pandey's inevitable 35(30) will be useful on this lmao,4
RR are just Sri Lanka in pink,1
Will these pitches keep slowing down as the league goes on?,2
The pitch is slowish but 90% of this wonderful start is good bowling.,2
"Rajasthan's batting woes in previous games were mainly due to Smith. Dude was meant to be the anchor, but he needlessly tried to be aggressive and thrown away his wicket. They have aggressors in Butler and Samson, let them deal with with aggressive batting. Also, Smith needs to come down to 4. He's the backup plan if Butler and Sanju fail without scoring much. Also, they need to keep Unadc##t as far away from team as possible. Give Varun Aaron one more match for fucks sake. He atleast got pace, Why the fuck they persist with Unadc##t??!  Sreyas Gopal is really bad this season, if there is no other quality bowler, play a batsman in place of him. Smith-Mcdonald combo made some terrible decisions this season.",0
Oh hell yeah Tyagi time,2
Warner literally runs instantly after hitting the ball. At such speed some day he might forget hitting. Dude is insane.,23
"Gud running guys, it's big ground so expecting lot of 2's",9
nice YJB,3
"Oh Jonny , you Beauty.",4
Shot jonny,2
Absolutely twatted by Jonny,2
"Am I the only one who doesn't hate KP commentary? It's a different variety to the subtle witty Indian bois, he just tells it like it is",2
Is it just me or serial downvoter is early today?,3
Test of fire for Samson on this ground,4
Why did RR go back to Unadkat and Utthappa? Even though the youngster have not been impressive but still the team can't get balance with these regular changes,3
Some of these bowling changes are kinda sus.,5
Whew. Bairstow's pull shot looks just as good as Rohit's.,1
"HELL YEAH, GOOD JOB YOUNG TYAGI",6
Get in there Kartik!,4
Brave to go even shorter. Credit to Tyagi there.,8
Sanjuuuuuuu Sanjuuuuuuuu,7
Unacademy must be very happy with Bairstow at the moment. They had gone almost 20 minutes without a mention.,7
Oh we r fucked,9
What a catch,7
Next time,7
That's a top catch,7
Mr consistent is a brilliant fielder,12
"Ooft Jonny that was delightful...

Oh, Jonny...that was less so.",10
That was waiting to happen,6
Great catch that!,7
"Fucking Samson, man.",9
6 and out. I wish SunnyG was commentating atm,6
"Jofra should get Samoa Joe's theme while he's running in so that people can chant

***joff joff joff***

and even

***jofras gonna kill you***",3
"TYAGIIIIII, MY BOIIIII",3
Damn Sanju!,8
"Well, that‚Äôs game, see y‚Äôall next match",8
"Oh yes, Tuk Tuk Pandey to help maintain the run rate of 4",10
Bairstow got absolutely played there. It was stupid to go for 2 sixes in a row in same area in this ground.,15
Well fuck,8
Loved how Bairstow farmed the strike in the Third over to save his buddy Warner.,7
How someone compiles a 1 hr bowling video of Tyagi.,8
Flying Samson,12
"**4.4** Kartik Tyagi to Bairstow, OUT, **lovely catch to the left at deep square.** Tyagi gets this one higher and Bairstow is done by the pull shot! **23-1**

JM Bairstow c Samson b Kartik Tyagi 16 (19b 0x4 1x6) SR: 84.21",6
"Jonny you are my captain in dream 11 ,and I removed Tyagi, now RIP my points.",11
Samson da,7
How is Samson always so good in the field for a wicket keeper,12
Manish will hit all the balls to the fielders now,6
TYAAAAGI DESTINED FOR BIG THINGS,8
*IPL FIELDING RIGHT THERE*,5
Atleast samson's fielding is consistent,19
From a player's perspective do you think they miss crowd in stadium or is it the other way around where they enjoy playing without noisy crowd. I know about fake crowd voice but even they know that's fake.,7
"Alright guys, we in the tail now!",7
Those two overs from Jofra messed Bairstow up. This is as much his wicket as it is Tyagi's.,5
What a weekend of F1 and IPL,3
My body is ready for tuk tuk by Pandey,7
"All fielders should be trained wicketkeepers...new big thing in cricket.

Pooran and Samson doing amazing stuff out there...is Hetmyer keeper too ?",9
Test cricket is back,2
Shit umpiring this year,1
"If pandey shits the bed today, he should be out.",3
"One of the best all rounders of the world finally making their long awaited return, so excited to watch him play. Hope he has a great game with the bat & ball. Go! Vijay Shankar!!",23
Can Rajsthan remove smith and make stupid sexy butler the captain?,13
"Props to Tyagi for sticking to the plan after getting hit, real talent this boy",4
What a catch Sammy boi,4
"No stadium lights.

No problem.",4
Tyagi can be a good future bowler for India,9
wow SRH losing half their side already,2
"oh god, this guy...",3
The sandpaper derby,5
Oh shit here wo go again,3
[deleted],26
TUK TUK INTENSIFYING,8
"Off topic but I need advice 


So basically, I[17M] have started running for mental well being and I run around 1k twice a day ( 6:30 am) and (6:30pm) and I'm doing fine. It's been 3 days, since I started.

So my question is, I have to study for long hours for next few months and I wanna know how often I need to let my legs rest , besides, I don't listen to music while running because I want to be involved with environment while doing so ( Is this gonna help me or would just stress me out ?)",2
Defending Unadkat. Typical Pandey,11
SRH needs to target Unadkat,5
"As the pitches will get slower, Unadkat will transform into a spinner.",7
Sorry guys I‚Äôm new what‚Äôs this tuk tuk bout?,1
Pandey ji silently scores those 30's 40's and leaves. He is expected to play a bigger role than that.,3
I was going through the schedule and at least last 10 matches have been boring one sided affairs ( for a large part of the match atleast) . Not a good look for the tournament after that fantastic start,1
"bowler that took wicket good

batsman that out bad

fielder that catch good

amirite",5
Lmao srh batting taking a tip from tuk tuk CSK,8
Abysmal start from srh this,6
Lol... Jofra Archer always looks disappointed with himself.,6
Used to look forward to watching Warner bat. Now I csnt wait for it to end,4
Solid front foot defense. Missed test cricket so much,11
Pandey Sr must very materialistic to name son after money,5
Why is unadkat back?! üò°,6
He really got hit for 6 with a short one and thought the answer was even shorter and he was right,7
Well placed to the fielder.,6
Where can I buy a RR wide brimmed hat?,8
"*irrelevant*

Xiaomi Poco ad sucks...",4
Archer deserves an assist on every other RR wicket,11
"Wait, what? Unadkat is playing today. Does Smith even know his XI before going for the toss?",7
Unadkat is a little bit underrated he is not that bad as much as people scolds him,7
Why tf are there ads between dugout as well? I've had enough of these fucking awful ads what the fuck do I do,8
[deleted],12
"Only one thing for it Sunrisers.

Drop Bairstow, bring over Dom Sibley. That should up the run rate.",12
Lowest powerplay total this season?,10
Kohli played total 5 dot balls last match. Pandey usually has those many in an over,11
Conspiracy theory: sponsors are upholding the batriarchy so there's more sixes and their proucts are flogged more.,4
How was Manish Pandey so good for KKR but kind of average for SRH?,4
"Clearly not an easy pitch, same one as yesterday where everyone except Kohli struggled",9
"KKR setting the trend for a slow PP , Captain shaving off things # Trendsetters",1
Where does Unadkat get the balls to sledge Warner lmao,9
Is this the lowest score this year in the powerplay??,2
I swear slats would marry Warner if he could,3
Stokes is paler than a dead person,9
T20 Indian Premier League transforming into Test UAE Premier League,5
Slats-Warner will have to take it deep                                            CSK- Our lawyers will be contacting you shortly,2
Lord is here,1

Solid defence from pandey,7
Very good defence pandey garu,5
Yesterday we had Kohli's special on this ground when everyone else struggled. Over to Kane and Smith now.,7
"Wow such wonderful defence from Pandey.

Edit: WTF",2
Lord and Savior,1
Abhinav Mukund - didn't he perform good as test opener but then quickly faded away?,3
"What a shot, now take single",4
CSK players low key orgasmed looking at that power play score.,5
That was sweet!,1
Pandey showing Intent,3
What and who is a garu?,5
Pandey is basically a btec Kohli so he should be able to hit 45 here,6
Intent ‚Ñ¢¬©,3
I was just about to make a tuk tuk joke.,8
Wtf is up with Warne‚Äôs hair?,3
"Is it an unpopular opinion to say these slow, low pitches are just not great for t20?",14
Is it just me or does the Hotstar app on Android TV stream at 30fps? I'm watching on a diff TV with a set top box and it's so freaking smooth in comparison.,2
"Pandey, probably: why take singles when I can score a six",5
Pandey hits a six and then plays the next two balls to the fielder which then nullifies it,9
"Just because Warner has taken the role of the accumulator now, pandey tends to be more aggressive than usual and gets out earlier",6
Manish anna bringing in some intent,4
Come on PunDay,3
How generic these unacademy questions are!,4
Customary Manish Pandey six,4
Can‚Äôt wait for Ben stokes time,9

"Do not think the Lord is getting bashed ,he is just tryna give us a good game .",31
Good over for SRH.,8
Lord felt sad for Unadkat and making sure he won't be left out again due to his ER,5
How is Mukund not in the dugout more often? He's brilliant.,6
WTF was that last ball from Tewatia ji,3
Hmm.,1
"Shoutout to u/SanyogG who has always turned up for RR, hopefully the team performs for the sake of their fans",10
Lord showing mercy on SRH,10
Did someone forcibly stop these players playing left handed/right handed that they keep switching now to send a message,1
"Just a reminder that Warne owns the Royals. Like literally, he has something like 2-3 %  shares.",8
So what's the par score r/cricket reckons,3
"I'd just like to say: 

SRH have only played one match in Sharjah",6
"I've always said Pandey is Kohli lite. He's got about 80-85% of Kohli's talent and fitness but tries to play the same role in the team. If Pandey were to bat for India at number 3, he'd be averaging 40-odd at 85 strike rate in ODI's, which are decent numbers when seen independently. But we already have Kohli, so why bother with him?",9
Pitch is definitely slow and will further slow down during 2nd innings. Good news for SRH bowlers. They like such conditions.,7
Shreyas PayPal,3
Pandey ji is one of the most consistent of the lot here.,2
"A TV ad for a coding courses website. 

Lmao I can't wait for a future where everyone is a ""coder""",5
I'm betting stokes goes 0-50 off 3 and gets 7 runs. Because it's 2020 and everything sucks.,8
Seeing the condition itself tells me we gonna lose. Where's our Sadness Thread???,3
Shreyas pls just a 6 run over,2
Pandey is outlier in this side. Otherwise most of the batting lineup always looks for singles and doubles.,3
Devereux should bowl himself and turn it into a triple leg spin attack.,4
Did Swann just say that chariots of fire is about running the 4 minute mile? Wtf,4
Cunted,5
"Ah yes, play the powerplay defensively and hit a six in every over afterwards.",9
Anything above 160+ will be unchaseable,6
"They are in mood now.

Will Make up for powerplay in no time if they both get going.",5
So 38 degrees. Wonder what's the humidity. 70 most likely. Wonder how they go about training outdoors in these condition.,2

"Manish hit a six, and still striking at 100.. hufff",6
I N T E N T,2
Swann describing time outs is gold,5
So anyone hyped for today's German GP (F1)?,1
Biggest flaw of Pandey is the dot balls.  He could be hitting 6s and 4s but strike will still be 100 or 110 because he plays mostly dots between big shots.,5
RR should make Tewatia captain and play all games in Sharjah to win. /s,8
"Tensions were just rising and they take Ceat Strategic time out.

I hate this sometimes.",4
Ben stokes is gonna have a tough time in this heat isn't he?,1
"Just when there‚Äôs some momentum, take the time out",3
I think 160 is par score on this pitch folks,1
Don't think it's a bad idea to let Shankar bowl today. He actually filled in very well for Bhuvi's injury in the India-Pak World Cup game on a surface that was slowing up.,1
SRH will be a feared team when the limit on maximum number of overs by a bowler is taken away in T20s. Then come at us with Rashid's 10 overs you all. (Until then we'll huff and puff to 7-8 wins per season),7
Swanny with that same joke about umpire's watch at timeout evrytime,7
So like every time SRH raises expectations and then drowns them.. Today seems to be the same...,7
"Atleast CSK have a reason for playing Jadhav, they haven't got many good batsmen

Guys don't lose hope. Y'all are batting first. Just need to get upto a decent score and set it up for the bowlers to defend. It will get tougher in the second half to bat.,5

Specialist Fielder will eat up 4 dot balls and hit a boundary in the next. You'll rarely see him hit back to back boundaries.,7
This mf is just infuriating,7
even 130 seems defendable looking at the current state of RR,5
It‚Äôs tewatia not god damn shame warne take a single,4

Instead of letting Kane bat where we would be the best, they'd rather waste the ability of Kane by letting Pandey eat up valuable balls because he is beyond useless everywhere else. Just admit that Pandey is a lost cause ffs.  
 
Beyond infuriating. Imagine Kane coming in with plenty of time to settle down instead of having to go full tilt from ball one. He does well in that but that's not his natural game.",9

Pandey hits so many shots straight to fielders.,1
All your doing by taking 3 dot balls is putting pressure on Warner and that‚Äôs when he starts taking whack shots,1

Why does Warne sit in the owner's box? Is he an investor in RR or what? I thought he was the team mentor!,8
Reason they send pandey at 3 is because he intentionally play bad at other positions..,8
"Shut the fuck up, Banger. Stop hyping Pandey.",11
Why do Pandey's best shots go straight to the fielder....,6
Pandey is reminds me of Rayudu last night. Intent‚Ñ¢ nahi dikh raha,4
Warner didnt want that second.,2
Is dubai stadium a very big ground?,3
If Pandey gets anywhere near the WT20 squad I will scream. He is Thala lite. Bats lower down the order and inflates his average. He should be in the ODI team though at least as a transition player,4
"I think that Pandey‚Äôs 21(25) can be classed as an honorary Dentury.

It's difficult to play here.",3
Pandey always plays ODI cricket in T20. Don't know how he keeps getting selected in the T20I team. Is SRH still paying him 11cr?,5
Unadkat is too flimsy looking for a fast bowler. He needs to put some toned muscle on those bones.,5
Did hashim Amla stopped playing cricket?,5
Pandey uses every ounce of energy in his body to find a way to hit an absolute pie in the slot for a single on the leg side,8
Lord Vijay Shankar to come in and score 54* (9),8
Ok now just slog you stupid pandey,3

Props to KP for somehow managing to have a hittable voice,5
All I want is Warner to call him Pandeyji and do a bhojpuri duet..is that too much to ask?,10
"Why didn‚Äôt he do that 20 balls ago?

It‚Äôs even more frustrating to watch because Pandey clearly has talent but he still bats like he is trying to save a test match.",7
Gonna be hard chase seeing the condition of pitch,4
Williamson at 4 feels like a waste,8
"All these coaches, support staff, stats and videos and still nothing has fixed Manish Pandey's problem with dot balls and hitting hard and straight to fielders.",12

"Warner : We've to accelerate now.

Archer : Haha what did you say?",8
As soon as a good bowler comes fattu takes a single and goes off the strike...,6
Accelerate now guys,2
The fact that Warner has faced 35 of the 85 balls despite opening is worrying,6
Here we go 4th wicket alert in 4 overs. The so called experts are not getting it right. Now that Archer is here they are expecting wicket again.,1
Yo wtf. Why jofra at 14?,3
I've only just realised that Stokesy is finally back,4
Why the fuck are they taking break every two overs,1
Sunrises Hyderabad are trying to score quickly and Rajasthan Royals don't want that,1
If I heard that laugh without any context I'd think it was the laugh of someone having a manic episode,1
"Kingfisher ad: 

Smith's Hindi accent is so good man.",3
Thala Pandey playing well,3
Such anxiety when Warner faces Archer,2
Good running,2
"Pretty hilarious / cringeworthy having these world renowned commentators referring to things like an 'Unacademy cracking six' and 'he might be the Altroz super striker of the game, what a stylish car that is!', when none of them would ever consider driving that ugly hatchback in their life.",5
the fuck was that even,2
I‚Äôm kinda disappointed in our own fans here. It‚Äôs a difficult pitch. Pandey is doing okay. People need more patience. It‚Äôs fine coming from other teams‚Äô fans but I thought SRH fans were a little better. All this abuse for Pandey and he‚Äôs doing it fine.,4
So Unadkat and Stokes for death? RIP,2
Soo essentially SRH just have four more overs to score runs. Smh,2
"Just a reminder that Archer will get a free Xbox if he gets Warner out

Edit: Good onya Jof",23
Don't even think RR need to go chasing a wicket they're doing a decent job of keeping the run rate low,3
This is a surprise ODI game right guys ?,4
Ouch,5
"SRH fans: 

Expectation: pandey gets out..

Reality: Warner gets out...",12
RIP SRH,3
Archer gonna get that free Xbox now,3
Ah shit,1
Well it wasn't caught behind but Jof gets his rabbit again,3
High IQ fielding to keep Warner on strike to Archer!,6
Archer to get his Xbox,3
Damn needed 2 runs to get extra fantasy points there damn.,4
hit out or get out tbh,3
"Bruh Archer with his first clean, unbelievable.",9
üê∞üê∞,8
Bunny,6
Of course it‚Äôs right before his 50 to rob me off fantasy points,8

I love you archer.,3
Archer gets Warner lol who would have thought it,3
We're fucked bois,2
"Archer gets a free PlayStation.

Edit : He gets a Xbox.

Should have played archer a bit cautiously. There were other he could have targeted.,6
Brain dead from Warner.,1

Archer round the wicket to Warner>>>,4
Daveys front foot was closer to the dugout than it was to the ball,3
"**14.4** Archer to Warner, OUT, **splits middle and leg!** Superb. Didn't get him early on but gets him anyway. **96-2**

DA Warner  b Archer 48 (38b 3x4 2x6) SR: 126.31",1
Shouldn't have run the two and just save himself for the death lol,2
"Ffs looking bad, don't want srh to lose today",2
Exposing the wicket to archer smart,1
We are going to be defending 130s again,1
Archer gets Warner again lol,3
Fuck should have got that tuk tuk instead.,2
"Archer is such a gem.
He and Rabada has really lit up the fast bowling scene in IPL",7

Archer with test match figures,7
Manish Pandey took the wicket of Warner,4
I would be more than happy if they somehow manage 150,6
Warner's wicket is on Fucking Pandey. I'm calling him Pandey because I'm absolutely furious right now.,5

"Just tuned in. SRH making the same mistake as Punjab yesterday, low run rate in 15th over with many wickets in hand. Not looking good.",2
"Was about to say they should've bought Archer in for 18th, and 20th over instead. Good thing I didn't say it then. Cause Warner's wicket here is just so much more valuable than had he been out at the 18th over.",2
Archer you can‚Äôt be this good in a batsmen friendly tournamentüò≠,9
"Of all the bowlers to try and attack, why Jof?? He's just living in Warner's head rent free",17
Jofra is going to carry us to 2 successive T20 World Cup's on the trot. Absolute star.,20

I blame Pandey for this. He put so much pressure on warner,11
Warner left a straight one,3
"Fuck I just realized, imagine this DC team with Woakes.",2
"Archer screwing Warner, in both the international matches & in IPL.
DOMINANCE",3

Get 140 from here and there's a chance.,1
"Wow the vitriol on Pandey is just ridiculous. He came in at a difficult time and anchored well. RCB got to 160 from this same situation. With warner and Kane in the team its been a very good innings from Pandey.

Outstanding from Archer,5
"Pandey is the most infuriating player ever holy shit. I've legitimately never felt such pessimism about a player of a team I support, except maybe Pathan last season. Why the fuck does the SRH management persist with him at 3.",4
Don‚Äôt think Warner fancied that,2
Archer here with 6 runs in 3 overs also a wicket of David Frickin Warner. He is too precious.,12

"A team should just throw all their budget on Archer, Rashid Khan, Rabada as overseas. Wouldn‚Äôt even need batsmen",12

You have one of the best batsmen in the game who can play the role of an anchor while going at a SR of 140-150 and you send him out as a fucking finisher behind Manish Pandey. Just fuck off. Fucking wasted my afternoon, I have so many fucking assignments due.  
 
These boundaries don't change anything, it's the same with Pandey every fucking game. Labours to a strike rate of 120-125 despite hitting plenty of boundaries because the fucker does not know how to rotate the strike and his greatest talent is being able to find fielders with pinpoint accuracy.",3
Yeah Pandey. Prove me wrong. Hit few more like that.,12
I say don't criticize Pandey too much lest we have to make an apology thread when he hits 6 sixes in the last over,11

Smith has made some funny decisions this season.,3
another reminder to not hype U19 players,10
Tewatia helping Pandey do a Tewatia is the most Tewatia thing Pandey could want from Tewatia,13
Why give the over to tewatia when you have many overs from pacers still left?,6
Pandey got triggered because Tewatia addressed him as Pandey instead of Pandeyji.,9
Why is  [this](https://www.instagram.com/p/CGMyFGkn1mD/?igshid=whpfs0zp0ou6) not out?,13
I don't get how players think that they can compensate with sixes at end for dot balls. Having more than 20 balls in T20 is an absolute crime,13
"Manish Pandey: exists

Feel bad for Williamson. He hardly gets to play his game now :(,5
"On an unrelated note, I'll get my driving license tomorrow.",8
Let's see what r/Cricket's most loved player does here,6
Will the pitches be this slow for the rest of tournament or will new ones be prepared?,3
"50(40):slow ass BC,reason team keeps losing

48(38): genius being held back by the slow ass",15
What‚Äôs the par score? I think they need 150 but it‚Äôs looking like it will get slower,5
"Ah yes, 8 runs from an over on the death.",5
"Williamson is in a position of quick acceleration, which is quite new for him. But the man is such a giant that he might just pull it off",3
Anything above 140 looks good for this pitch now,2
"Unadkat bowling at the death

Batsmen: it's free runs",3
SRH fans seem to have this very distinct love-hate relationship with Pandey. Pandey comes good when it's desperately needed about 8/10 times though.,2
"Kane needs more balls , put him at 3 ffs",1
Unadkat?,0
Unadkat always looks like he's playing Ranji Trophy,2

Mid season transfer special RCB offer 2 for 1 Umesh and Siraj.,4
Missed some part of the game. Why is Stokes not bowling?,1
Swann making that Ghostbusters joke right after the insight from Lee was just hilarious.,3
Gotta cunt unadcunt. Jofra ain't giving shit.,6
150? Oh you mean 30 runs from 16 balls? Not with our batting,7
Unadkat bowls a lot of length slower balls at death. You need powerful horizontal bat strokes to clear the boundary. Pandey is good at playing with Horizontal bat. It's match made in heaven.,2
"Kanos is such a nice and patient gentleman who wouldn't click ""skip ads"" on Youtube",13

Unadkat in death overs is a masterstroke for either RR or SRH,8

Hyderabad lead by 122 runs..,8
Jaydev Unadkat has 14 ~~13~~ wickets vs SRH - the joint-~~third~~ second best tally by any bowler against the Hyderabad franchise. Bravo - 17 wickets M Sharma - 14 wickets Malinga - 13 wickets,3
Srh dugout seem super cheary and optimistic and I‚Äôm getting worried,7
"Pandey at 3 and Williamson at 4 is better for the team balance

It's a team game, not a Kane Williamson exhibition",5
Looks like r/Cricket doesn't know their cricket judging by the number of people who seem to think Pandey played badly..,10
Don't get penisey kid,1
IMO it would have been better to send Shankar at the death over Williamson. Need some raw power.,2
"Srh dougout is chill, they are laughing as if we scored 180 or something.",6
Always feels good to see Manish Pandey perform. He's my super super senior from school :),5
Even 150 is looking difficult with archer bowling one,2
alright tewatia!,2
Imagine having Vijay Shankar as your 5th bowler when you can have Jason Holder.,-3
What the fuck is that throw Smithy. Unreal,7
Not everyone is Kohli,11
The only way this pandey innings is justified is if the pitch is a bitch to bat on. Which I don't think it is.,5
Unadkat apology thread when,13
No apology thread it seems,6
Why aren‚Äôt the SRH management worried. I get it‚Äôs a slow pitch but this doesn‚Äôt look good,6

Ugh pandey..... Play till the 20th over ffs,2
Unadkat redumption arc?,4
"Hapiness is... 

Drinking fine wine... 

Sex... 

When Manish Pandey gets out...",1
Jofra has conceded 6 runs in his 3 overs. 6 runs in 3 overs! That's insane,16
Wow this is bad acceleration,7
Send Williamson at fucking 3 next time. He won‚Äôt slow the run-rate down.,4

"Here we go, another death collapse",1
"Well played Manish Pandey..
But please end this affair with hitting the ball directly to fielders ‡≤•‚Äø‡≤•",10
Unadkat waited for this pitch for three years,7
Are you retarded? Is Shankar not fit? Why Garg over him?,4
"Wtf is Murali Kartik talking about? We want slower, and difficult to bat pitches as the tournament goes on??

Now.. 60m boundary in a flat deck isn't what I want. But batsman just being unable to hit the ball because the pitch is two paced isn't what I want atleast. Swing in the early overs?? I'm fine. Turn & bounce for the spinners? That's fine too.

But batsman simply unable to time the ball because it's a shit wicket isn't what I want in T20 cricket.",4
"Please don't make apology threads. Don't abuse players, keep it simple, and you wouldn't need to apologise.",18
"Typical pandey innings ,defend the fuck out of other batsman and they throw wicket playing risky shots.

 Pandey scores safe 40 or 50 then fucks out in the final overs making srh batsman to throw bat at everything and losing wickets and bowlers had to defend some shit total.

Fuck BC",5
"Unadkat, Dube, Vijay Shankar all are from the Venkatesh Prasad school of fast bowling",7
"Where were you when Manish Pandey gave a tribute to Rahane ?!!

Just Kidding, well played man",6
This situation needed Abhishek and not Garg.,7
The hate and vitroil on this thread by SRH fans is ridiculous. Pandey doesn't deserve this level of abuse,15
Unadkat is so pathetic that he got Manish Pandey out.. That would make 10 runs + to SRH..,9
"r/Cricket shitting on Pandey is good , sledge him to form bois",11
Pandey can never do a full blown assault. He's a one six then few dots and singles player.,5
"Tbh unadkat has been quite fine today, really knew the length and pace and didn't gave off much runs. Are we seeing the return of 2017 Unadkat?",7
Sendin Garg before 3D lmao,6
"Kane should bat at 3 or open, or else to be replaced with Nabi.",4
You are free to call bullshit on this but I've always thought that the UAE  pitches would suit Unadkat's play style.,8
"Can't figure if pitch bad, or bowling good, or batting bad",8
I wonder how all these people are getting tired but koach jumps fields and screams like a monkey and comes again to bat and play till the end and runs 3runs at the end of innings.,7
Unadkat missing the stumps from that close lol,1
Garg looks like one of the Akmal brothers in his batting gear.,1
Brainfade from RR. Should have allowed Agent Pandey to bat a few more balls.,1
"Should have sent Abhishek!!

He can hit from get go.",3
Come on William Kaneson,3
Why do they keep on sending Priyam at the death ahead of other players! Wtf is VVS smoking to consider him a pinch hitter. If we lose..,2
Next match of KXIP is against RCB,2
So who's creating the Unadkat Apology thread?,2
Yo never realised how lowkey similar Shankar and Rashid look,1
Unadkat will go for 10Cr in next auction!,3
Can Bairstow bat 2 down? They open with warner and kanos allowing kanos to play his natural game and Bairstow can provide firepower to the middle order,4
I am scared because RR is the only team that can loose it from here,3
Is Abhishek not in good books of management. Why on earth you would send Garg aheah of him man. Crazy shit. Send Vijay Shankar next and finish us off.,5
Kanos is alien,6
Kano at 3 now and forever,4
How the fuck did that go for 6,4
Williamson can play fuckin anywhere.,9
Y‚Äôall need to chill. It went from pulling pandeys leg to actual anamous comments,6
Wasn't expecting it to go over the boundary!!,3
Make 150 somehow...,2
Home run.,1
How did that go for six,2
What a shot that is tbf,2
Second match in a row over handed six üòÅüôè,1

Srh fans - why is Kane batting so slow.",4
that was sexy,0
We lost the game,1
No idea how he's managed to get that away with one hand,5
Another one hand stunner,4
Wtf was that Kanos,5
Kanos with his one handed Shithousery.,1
How the fuck did that travel 93 meters,11
Kaned it,3
93 metres with 1 hand!!,5
Right handed Pant vibes,8
What was that defensive shot in the 18th over from Garg?,2
Lol Kane again hits a one handed six,8
Oh come on Jof. Not again.,2
That went 93 m ffs,3
Kane de Villiers,6
"Thank god it didn't hit him, make more out of that no ball",3
luckily it's past Kiwi bedtime,6
"Pace in the slot will go the distance

Back of a length slower balls are the way to go on this pitch",2
Another beamer from Archer.. he wants to kill,8
"A lot of beamers in this IPL!!

Sweat?",5
What is up with beamers this season?,3
Can Garg convert a free hit from archer?,2
Does anyone feel like there have been a lot of beamers in this IPL so far? Almost like we have several a match.,9
Can we get to 150 at least?,2
"Yup calling it since the last week

So many beamers this season, things are getting out of hands",9
I feel Williamson gets easily under the nerves of bowlers like Bumrah and Archer.,14
3D was the designated no.4 for India in wc but no.7 for SRH lmao,9
And another beamer,3
"If you can't stop him,kill him. ~ Jofra 2020.",12
Kanos never disappoints.,6
"There's a scratch on him, Jofra.. And I'll bring down the sky on you.",12
Imagine hitting a God like Kanos. Archer should be banned from IPL /s,11
"If Kanos doesn't bat at 3 next game I will legitimately stop watching the remaining games, I get tilted too easily. At his best Pandey is half the player that Kane is. Letting him eat up 50 balls and sending Kane out as a finisher, fucking hell. We do not deserve Kane.",5
It's like Joffra loses all focus in his 4th over,6
Another slip of hand from Joffra,2
CSK should be hungry for Williamson.,13
Beamers happening so much more often this IPL. Someone is going to get badly hurt soon,19
Bruh Archer,6
"What's up with bowlers bowling a beamer after getting for six? Saini, Thakur and now Jofra",7
Bowled on a free hit is classic,13
Kane showing his inner power,3
There's nothing like getting bowled on free hit.,15
Garg gone for the next 4 balls lol,6
Kanos should have just kept strike,11
5 dots incoming,5
Why so many beamers in this IPL ? Can't blame dew now here can you,2
A beamer in every game is more like a weapon. I think it should count across games. Beamer isn‚Äôt supposed yo be used like a weapon.,3
"My god... 

Send the pinch hitters not Garg.",3
Seeing an unusually high number of beamers this season.,2
Lord Shankar! Please grace us without your presence..,2
Good thinking by Archer bowling slow,2
"I get garg scored half century against CSK but man send someone else, why garg ?",2
Buttler is absolutely shite when the ball bounches before him,2
Where's our 3D player?,3
"They should‚Äôve actually run, because the bails were dislodged. Wouldn‚Äôt a direct hit at the strikers end not be enough? They‚Äôd need to pick up the stump.",7
Pandey should've stayed. He's better bat than a non-set batsman facing Jofra at the start,0
Lmao what an over so far,1
Swann being schooled by lee here. Hhahahaha,3
Lmao Brett Lee giving a masterclass on beamers üòÇ,3
"Thanos : You should have gone for the head.

Archer : Understandable, have a good day.",5
question - how do you do a runout on a free hit when the bails are already off on that end?,2
Worst dive of all time from Stokes lol,1
"swanny: he (JOFF) did that on purpose

scott: let's get back to the free hit",5
CSK should definitely go after Kanos in the next auction(whenever that is),7
Too many beamers in this IPL.,3
That's a no ball again.,5
Should've sent Rashid ffs,6
Archer isn't gonna bowl anything other than a yorker,7
They are not able to hit full tosses either. Must be one of those difficult pitches.,10
"Wah SRH, I thought Kumble was stupid for sending Prahbsimran against Narine. But sending Garg against Archer tips it.",9
What is this obsession of CSK fans over Kanos man?,9
Kanos seems so out of balance trying to hit every ball out of the park. I fucking hate his management for making him bat this way.,9
Why garg over abhishek?!?,8
Garg should either play in top 4 which is not possible or should be dropped for someone else,6
"Damn, we need a serious finisher. Otherwise, we don't have a chance in this tournament",6
Send Vijay Shankar at 5 pls.,6
All of y‚Äôall are saying bat willimson at 3 but there is much more to that surface level stuff. If you think Pandey is bad now him batting at 4 is way worse but apparently r/cricket knows more than cricket statisticians,12
"Man Garg is really not good in the death. He‚Äôs a good batsman, but poor decision to send him out over 3D/Abishek/Rashid in the death",10
im sorry who is swann?,0
What's better is that you have young dude in garg who genuinely can bat in the top 4 and get shankar samad and sharma after that. Pandey might have cost himself his place with this werid ass innings today,2
"Even with the current score, I'm pretty sure SRH can defend this seeing the RR collapse against DC",6
Wow Warners strike rate is less than Rahul in this season,4
All I wanna know is whether the match winner Robbie Uthappa is in the team today or not?,6
"a lot of the beamers are intended full toss balls at the waist going too high

because a lot of the batsmen struggle to hit the full tosses",6
"Hopefully this match gets done before 7:15, need to sneak in my bath before the 2nd match starts :P",12
Pandey's innings today goes to show that not everyone can do what Kohli can.,13
I think SRH has failed to utilise Priyam Garg by playing him as his finisher rather than there top 3. But can't blame them with their top 4 set.....,8
Williamson is class apart.,11
"yeah, no way RR are getting to 140. game over tbh",4
Rip Archer's figures,8
"*First ball six last ball six , kane let's have sex.* :P",9
KANOSSS,7
Pies.,1
"SRH's medium pacers have a built in advantage

Pace is much easier to get away on this pitch",0
And people say Williamson isn't fit for T20's,9
Williamson is playing in different match,12
"Kanos should come at no.3, atleast he can accelerate his innings better than pandey (no offense to him).",7
Ben *makes things happen* stokes is going to win this for us. It would be rude to not do so,4
Williamson is a class apart,8
You know a batsman is good when they hit 2 sixes to a bowler who gave off 6 runs in his previous 3 overs.,8
Williamson doesn't give a shit about Archer or his pace.,13
This is why Kane should bat at 3.,7
Garg better hit a six or give a single to Williamson.,3
Where is muh 3D boi,2
"Lol ...6 in first 3, 19 in the last over for Archer..... damn",10
Kane is a fucking god. Why are they not batting him at 3 to maximise how many balls he faces smh,8
Damn he toyed it,4
That's class,2
149kph deposited in to stands.,7
[deleted],3
I know Pandey has earned his position at 3. But play Williamson there if you want more runs. Not fair with him getting just 15 balls each match.,5
"Kane is love, kane is life",5
Imagine hitting Joff for two sixes in an over,3
Since my boards are coming I can only watch one innings. Should it be rr cos I support them or mi vs dc second innings cos that's going to be good cricket?,1
We're around 20runs short,1
19(10)>>>54(44),7
Fuck yeah,1
Someone should go and compare jofras figures overs 1-3 compared to over 4. His figures are god tier and then he bowls his 4th over haha,4
Should have sent kane when ginger was gone,1
Garg-antuan,4
Garg is the future of SRH!,4
"Where everyone struggles, this man just breezes past. The difference in level.",9
Highest run getter with strike rate of over 140 is not good enough!,3
Kanos smashing Archer feels so satisfying man.,9
Give strike to Kanos boy,4
"Go go Garg, good shot",11
Unadkat back to normal now,10
Unadcunted,6
Williamson hitting archer for sixes is my favorite thing ever lmao,5
All the complaints about Garg..  don't compare to prabhsimranüòÇ,9
"Kanos is as fluid a player you can get, he'll get you runs from absolutely anywhere",6
"Garg apology thread 

- u/Plugfix27 (renowned backtracker)",8
"Smith in press conference ""we let them get 10-15 too many""",5
Listen you need to send Kane at no.3. There's absolutely no use sending Manish. He'll just pile up pressure on other batsmen.,2
"It's so fucking disrespectful for Kane to be batting below Pandey when he's a top class no. 3. 

You don't fuck over a better player to accommodate a lesser one.",7
Actually going to cry about what we've done to Kane.,8
[deleted],5
Kane is special man. So good.,6
Lord Unadkat üôè,0
Why would you not bowl Tyagi? Cutters > Yorkers?,5
Gargamel,5
That's a glorious slap,5
"The pitches are turning out to be exactly what batsman like Kohli, Williamson, Smith and other quality ones can thrive on",6
Shitting the bed in 20th by bowling Unadkat üòí,6
"There's a reason Williamson is in the fab 4. People underestimate him because he's good in tests as well, but he's a gun batsman and a great captain.",10
Only Kanos can hit Archer for 19 runs.,4
Kanos thrives on tough pitches!! He would have been in top 4 runs getter if got more time in the middle this IPL!!,9
160 on the cards,7
kanos u absolute beauty,4
Beamer now?,2
Batting line up for RR with stokes looks unreal tbh,2
"Pitch is slow guys, we saw Pandey struggling so clearly every batsman will struggle ‡≤†_‡≤†",6
Archer economy of 6 after 3 matches at Sharjah. That‚Äôs absolutely mental as a powerplay and death bowler,5
Archer 3 overs for 6 and 4th over goes for 19,7
Kanos always has this ability to attack the best bowler.,8
The tactic to Jof should be to pretend all his overs are his 4th. He melts when people attack him back,6
"Williamson showing that he can finish which virtually no one else in the SRH side can do effectively

This thread: bat him at 3

How is it this difficult to understand that they have others who are decent at 3? Williamson is levels above everyone else in the side at the end of an innings",31
"Kane cunting Archer out of the ground, what a sight!!! The best puller and hooker among the current batsmen.",8
Kanos mama is love,5
SRH hitting sixes in the death doesnt feel like SRH,20
"From Kane Williamson, the anchor to Kane Williamson the finisher. Brilliant !!",10
Unadkat should change his name to Unacademy for sponsorship reasons.,11
Garg doing a Tewatia,4
"Average batsman get out to good bowlers 

Good batsman see off good bowlers to target others

Great batsman take on good bowlers to show their class",3
Now GARGle. Then spit,2
So basically RR needs to chase 145 of 16 overs.,8
Rajasthan fielding is all over the place. Ugly.,10
170 coming up,2
"Hahaha over throws,kane is on strike.",5
Da fuck,2
Garg has already done more than former U19 captains like Unmukt Chand. He needs to be preemptively retained before the mega auction like Kohli was in 2010 even though his IPL record was nothing too special back then.,7
Lmao Kane was already turning around for the 2nd when Stokes threw it,3
When Stokes has only bowled one over that means you have one too many bowlers. And they're another batsmen light as they're batting Uthappa at 4/5. RR management are dumb,2
Jaiswal was dropped for Uthappa again? There's no surprise he played like that in previous match.,4
Wonder what unadkat doing there without collecting the ball,1
"9 off 3, come on",2
"**Kane Williamson v Jofra Archer in T20**

15 balls

27 runs

0 wickets

*Cricviz*",12
smith is dummy man.,0
If only kanos came before Pandey,3
Unadkat waiting there for the ball to get magically into his hands,3
Smithy hahaha,3
"Finally 150, feels like 200, haat Pandey gandu",-2
Smith can‚Äôt throw,6
Haha I think even Kane threw like that recently.,3
Turns out all the decisions by the management did work out in the end,6
Smith throws it into the ground and then asks why no one was there to grab it.,6
Recreating that lenskart ad.,9
Wait...that's wide.,3
The fuck was that shot,7
Lmao! Don't do that Kanos. xD,3
Smith's throwing technique looks as good as his batting,9
Don‚Äôt know if Stokes is fully fit or not but some odd bowling changes by Smith. I would‚Äôve bowled Jof in the 17th and tried to get Kanos out sooner,3
Never seen Kane play a shot like that in my life lmao,2
SRH management realising how different the table would be if kanos was playing since the first game,6
"Free runs, it looks in.",4
Bitch throw,7
Rajasthan players doing everything to let Unadkat concede more than Archer lmao,5
Not a wide. Come on!,3
That's such a harsh wide call,5
That wasn't a wide. Ouch,8
Why why why kane?,3
"Common fucking blind mf, how was that wide you Buffon",4
That throw by SPD reminded me of this funny throw that Kane threw once. Remember that?,5
"Perhaps Smith forgot to *ahem* 

sandpaper his palms",10
"'It's CHAOS out there!'

Actually it's pronounced KANOS",9
wtf was kane trying to do,3
Kane playing the role of ABD,5
I see the six but shouldnt it be Abhishek or Vijay shankar at this point ahead of Garg,3
How tf was that a wide?,6
[Those sixes were just... ](https://i.imgur.com/048x0PR.jpg),5
Wow Williamson reverse sweep. I have seen it all now.,6
That's not a wide,5
A batting order with just Williamson clones would be quite good...,7
That wasn't a wide. Dafuq.,5
No slats! It's ~~chaos~~ Kanos out there,8
Harsh wide IMO,6
lmao kane,7
Give strike to garg. He seems to know how to hit Unadkat,2
RR really throwing it away these last 2 overs... Why do teams keep doing this...,2
He gave that a wide? It wasn‚Äôt wide and they didn‚Äôt give actual wides early on.,8
That wasn't wide IMO,6
So Unadkat is a slow bowler with a quicker one as his variation,13
Khaleel : Is this legal?,9
Umpire who gave that a wide is a idiot,7
One more big hit and they will have a par score i guess,7
Williamson is doing a handy job as finisher.,7
Brilliant from Garg,10
Fab 4 it seems. More like Fab 2. Smith and Root are really not as good as Kohli and Kanos,2
Poor call for that wide,2
Garg for Retained,9
"Our friend, Stokes is out there!!",2
Told you guys! Marnus already scored his and Smithy's run quota for today and now Smith has so little power bar left that he doesnt even know how to thrown anymore.,8
But but r/cricket told me that Priyam can't bat at death,21
Damn garg is looking promising,8
RR to go on top of the fair play table with Garg admitting that 4.,7
Garg apology thread,18
"Four,cross that 160 witha six",8
Good cameo from Garg.,18
All you Pandey defenders look at this kid bat and tell me what Pandey did was a-okay. Mindless ninnies,9
"Why do they make Unadcunt bowl these overs! He ha had so many bad ones, he must have PTSD even thing about death bowling",2
"Kane Williamson is the most underrated player ever. He can play both as an anchor, as a finisher and can play in any position.",13
If 74% of your variation is a slow ball then it's not a variation,57
Swann's been throwing shade on the 3rd umpire since the great can you rock and roll it event,13
"Surprisingly enough, Garg is having the best strategy against Unadkat compared to Kane and Manish. Wait deep in the crease without side ways movement and wait for those slow back of a length balls.",13
‚ÄòThe power play might be the difference‚Äô Slats clearly didn‚Äôt watch the KXIP v KKR game yesterday,7
"Akash chopra - Ek aur slower one...inki khasiyat...inki kabiliyat...(For unadkat)

Me (an intellectual) - Inki Majburiüò¥ (fastest Ball 132kmph)",28
Buttler with a last ball runout while keeping is iconic cmv,11
Garg apology thread loading,11
Aggressive Kane? Now I've seen it all.,15
Good to see some players finally taking the suicidal 2nd off the last ball instead of protecting their average.,49
Good total by SRH üëè,5
Kanos had to run Garg out to take revenge.,55
Nice intent.,5
Nice little cameo from Garg.,5
Buttler taking the ball in front of the stumps to enact a run out on the final ball of the innings >>>>>,11
didn't Garg run into Rashid Khan in one of the earlier games,7
"Think 159 is par if not slightly above par tbh

SRH should win if they bowl well",6
"Well played, Garg!!",12
Good finish from SRH. Garg is really good. Can't wait to see him in top order in couple of years.,6
"Ya it‚Äôs gonna be so hard to defend this unless the pitch is trash. Which if it is, we need a Pandey apology thread",12
158 the target on the board for Stokes to chase down,7
We‚Äôll only know how slow/tricky this pitch is after a few overs of the RR innings but SRH have given themselves a good chance here,7
"Par total, should be a good game",3
A wonderful ambassador for Pan Parag,6
In the next match please send Garg/Kane ahead of pandey,6
"Good score for the neutral I think, can be chased but not guaranteed",4
Good total on this pitch i think,7
"Welp 159, seems easy, but yeah don't overestimate RR",5
Priyam Garg showing more intent than the entire csk batting line up.,7
"Garg, Run-outs and Taxes",4
What‚Äôs the dugout laughing about?,4
"**19.6** Unadkat to Garg, 1 run, OUT, full slower ball wide outside off, reaches out and lofts to long-off's left. Jofra picks up on the bounce and then sends a vicious throw to the striker's end on the bounce. Garg has no chance of making it **158-4**

PK Garg run out (Archer/&dagger;Buttler) 15 (8b 1x4 1x6) SR: 187.50",1
20 runs extra.,1
surprised they didnt go upstairs for that run out too lmao,8
Stoinis would've only taken 1 there to preserve his average.,3
We may be 10 runs too short. It depends on Rashid and if they choose to play him out. Hope Shankar/Abhishek can finish their quotas without too much damage. Everyone else knows the plan.,2
"good cameo from Kanos, should bat at 3 next game",2
That‚Äôs about 8-10 runs below par I think,2
All will now depend mainly on whether Butler gets out early or not. Will we see a Samson comeback?,5
Even Garg did well lmao,4
Drop pandey lol. Garg is damn good.,4
"I think I'm ready bros. RR supporter since the 1st edition. Constantly disappointed. Always like SRH. But today watching the game, I feel like cheering every SRH run.

I think I'll switch loyalties finally",-1
Classic SRH squeeze on the cards with all our slow bowlers.,14
Williamson only facing 12 balls while PandeyG faced 44 balls is a tragedy.,11
Hyderabad somehow manages to make these 150-160 total and make them look like 190-200.,12
So Garg finished with a better strike rate than Kanos? The affect of r/Cricket,9
Smith just needs to play a typical smith innings and RR will win. The target is not big enough so smith should just play naturally rather than try to play funky pull shorts.,10
"SRH clearly have bowling to defend this, RR top 4 needs to play good to get this chase",6
I see **no reason** for Williamson to bat under Pandey. He's just not consistently good.,3
140  to 160 is kind of a lucky total for SRH. They mostly defend these kind of targets.,7
"I feel like all the SRH middle order batsman are too similar - Pandey, Garg, Kane and Shankar. It would‚Äôve been nice if Samad came off.",3
"Archer goes for 19 in his last over 

r/cricket : oh dear gorgeous 

Unadkat goes for 16 in his last over 

r/cricket : you fucking donkey",99
I think people here had too high expectations. It's not an easy pitch at all. You can't blame the batsmen for not trying. Quite difficult to time the shots. Even kw couldn't time a few.,6
Backing SRH to win this now,5
Pag or kanos for number three please next match,2
10 bucks says KP has already banged that chick.,5
I hope Stokes makes up for lost time tonight. I need a chasing team to win again.,5
"

defendable total, imo.. considering SRH's bowling line up and Barbies current form",3
Typical SRH grind to get a kind of modest total they usually defend with great bowling and fielding.,6
"Why do people keep saying send Kane in at 3 over Pandey. If Pandey is already takes so long to get settled at 3, then do you really think he‚Äôd be better at 4??",3
"I think this is a very decent total for SRH, given how slow the pitch is playing. The only problem for them is that they don't have a world class pace bowler in the side. That is the only thing that might hurt them.",4
When you realise Garg showed intent than entire CSK team yesterday,8
"Somebody please tell Steve Smith not to play those weird ass shots from the beginning. If Steve Smith/Butler/Samson just bat throughout and take the ones and twos, RR will win",14
"**In between, Jofra Archer in IPL2020**

4-0-26-1 (Sharjah)

4-0-46-0 (Sharjah)

Dear God can Williamson get a chance at no. 3?,7
"Kanos should be sent at no 3, a well set Kanos can do a lot of damage",3
35 in last 2 overs from us? Bitch I‚Äôll take that for our death batting statistics.,20
Can we appreciate the over rate.,6
Feel RR will chase it down easily. Unless they choke like csk yesterday.,7
Somehow on Paper Manish scored a 50 but I don't feel great about that contribution.,11
Priyam Garg and Riyan Parag seems like anagram.,94
if they sent kane and garg ahead of pandey they could have had 10-15 runs more,6
Should have stopped at 140,4
Nabi would've been perfect for this pitch,2
"Not a bad total, still feel srh will lose and there will be 3 overs remaining",7
If you only watch highlights you'd think Manish Pandey batted brilliantly.,14
Proper game for Smith to come clutch,6
"Pandey at 3 and Kane at 4 was a good idea when we couldn't trust our middle order. But now with Garg, I think Kane should be back at 3 especially when the batting is going to get tougher as we enter the second half of the tournament. Like Kohli, he should play as many balls as possible.",5
"Everybody shitting on Pandey, rightfully so but Warner wasn't very good either today",7
"Pandey scores 54 @ 122 s/r on what looks like a difficult pitch. He sets up the next batsmen. And yet he gets shat upon because the next batsmen did exactly what they were supposed to do. 

Can never please folks here.",14
Please just anchor the chase smithy. No weird shots please,4
Kanos being a finisher is something you can only get from SRH!,15
[deleted],-2
"This is basically the same match as yesterday. Gill = Manish, Karthik = Williamson, and prolly Narine = Rashid. IPL scriptwriters are getting lazy.",13
"I hope Buttler has a good game, watching his shoulders wiggle before he hits the ball is mesmerizing.",12
"The standard template should be that Warner-Jonny-Kane take the the team till ~14th over mark and begin to tee off. After which begin to send in your finishers. They have shown ability when given the chance. 

Pandey comes in before 14 if a wicket falls and to steady the ship. Or at the very end to play smartly as get runs at the death without having to be super risky. 

He isn't cut out to play a Kohli/Sky/Iyer type job. Especially when you have Kane and Warner.",2
"Warner too plays for orange cap, used to play shots  
I think it's clear pandey takes time to set and play big shots but why Warner is holding back when Kane is left",0
"Ashton Agar shield hundreds this year:1

Steve Smith hundreds this year: 0

Why is this fraud in the Australian team?",7
"I think Williamson being a better batsman should be given the chance to face more balls. Now Pandey's innings might turn out to be adequate in retrospect, but 8/10 times Williamson will be more productive given the same number of balls.",1
Rajasthan is gonna win. We're 10 runs short,3
"Smith needs to anchor, or else we'll collapse",6
"To everyone saying that Pandey would be worse at 4 - so what? Why the fuck should our batting lineup hinge on getting the best out of a mediocre player who is simply incapable of playing in any other role even when he's surrounded by three world class players. It makes absolutely no sense. If he's useless at 4 then get him out of the team, stifling Kane to accommodate him is braindead.",5
"*man fucking his gf*

Pandya: Ye me kar lete, tum dream 11 pe team banao",-4
"First innings over within 100 minutes, that gotta be a record of sorts",5
"Rahane was a capable opener and captain for RR, served them years  
Don't think Smith offers something extra, worst trade",5
"Historically, defending totals like these is what makes SRH a dangerous team. Time to clench the assholes Bois",13
SRH better retain Kanos or else he'll go for a huge price in the auction.,18
Can't wait to watch Stokes bat,6
Even the shot Pandey played to get out to is a meme.,5
As I remember whenever pandey scores SRH lose .,14
Hoping to see a Rashid masterclass,6
This is the perfect target for Smith to play like he usually does.,6
"169 was good enough yesterday, 158 on a day game with RR batting, def a Srh win.",12
A captain defending 160 and having a Rashid Khan is a gift,6
RR won the first two games before Shane Warne showed up and lost four in a row since.,7
Stokes is coming,1
Kanos to RCB yaaaaahhhhhhssssss. Kanos + Koach yaaaaasssssshhhsss,1
Ben stokes to open fuck,5
Just hoping that Khaleak Ahmed doesn't leak too much,5
Wait.... WHAT?,5

Wooh look whos opening,3
Oh bc it's stokesy,3

Ah man that is the opening pair of dreams,4
Literally the only place Uthappa plays well is opening,3
WOAH,3
Wtf STOKES IS opening,6
"Wow, ballsy move by Smith",3
Stokes opening?!,1
"What in the world?? Warner is stumped, they are stumped.",2
"The problem with letting your top 3 batsmen bat 1,2 & 3 is that if they all get out you collapse hard you see this with the Royals

with SRH if Warner or Bairstow get out early they can send in Pandey to pad the lineup and save Kane for the second of the innings",1
Last time Stokes opened he cunted WI bowlers around the park,8
has to be one of the studpidiest decision,3
Stokes opening LMAO,5
"Seriously get Kane on no. 3, you're wasting him",6
"SRH doing what RCB did to us, last game! feel like it's a curse that's being passed around.. :(",1
Redditors are managing RR now?,8
"Perfect decision, Stokes hasn't played for a while so you send him out to open with no pressure",5
Anyone remember when these two opened in a test this summer... Hopefully it'll be better this time,8
"Was gonna turn in after a few overs, but now i'm watching with wide eyes.",1
"Stokes didn't get much to bowl so he gets to open

"For people shitting on Pandey, bairstow couldn't hit for shit towards the start of innings lol. Pandey scored 31 Off his last 15 balls once he settled in. His innings will play a good role imo",2
Holy moly...... Butler and Stokes to open.. RR targeting 80 in PP.,7
Is it me or the players in RR look like they just want IPL to be over,2
"One of the glaring thing observable in this IPL is how much is a team‚Äôs success is dependent  on their middle order strength or rather, the Indian middle order batsmen strength.",6
RR trying to make their heavy top-order heavier and their light bottom-order lighter,6
Dont take Uthappa in the 11 then if you want to make him bat at 5,6
Wtf? Stokes opening why??,2
Oh mate inject all of this,7
Wtf only Stokes with Tewatia can make this any crazier.,7
Stokes opening the batting is a bigger WTF??!! than final episode of Raised by wolves.,8
"Hey, wasn't there someone who predicted this (Buttler Stokes opening) in the chat today?",5
Brain fade,3
Nico Hulkenburg and Ben stokes = playing at the eleventh hour,5

Wait what Stokesey with Butler? I'm sorry I didn't realise I tuned into England's last 10 overs? Will the reach 400?,8
Stokes and Buttler at the crease. 159 needed off 20 overs...I think RR will win by the barest of margins,4
Was going to install a coat stand today but now I can just hang all of my coats on my huge erection,6
"They sent the only proper middle order batsman they have, to open instead.",8
Ahh classic forward defence from Stokes!,2
Pandey is batting himself out of the Indian Team with such an innings.,4
Smith loves to mess with Robbie,8
"Rr is playing all their cards upfront, hoping it'll work",4
The Englishmen are going to smash Sandy's 125 km/h bouncers outta the park.,9
Stokesy üòç,6
"Uthappa in middle order is useless, what is the point of this?",5
LMAO YOU'RE SAVING UTHAPPA FOR?,2
/u/itsnotme98 Warne heard you from the RR dugout.,4
lol brian lara just said ‚Äúupattha‚Äù,6
Here we go,2
Are we in the super over already?,4
Stokes laughs at your slow pitch.,3
This is a very interesting development.....,2
So the message is clear,3
I remember how it ended the last time Stokes and Buttler opened for England.,2
I feel sad for Robin only place he could bat good is taken from him,7
No respect given to Sandeep Swingeshwar Sharma,3
"SRH all the way, but Stokes-Buttler ‚ù§Ô∏è",9
Didn't expect Stokes to open but its a welcome move,5
"Dafuq is wrong with smith. As Lara says, Uthappa has to open of he is in the team. Makes no sense.",5
Okie see y‚Äôall next game,11
Not a bad start Ben....,1
"Send your best batsman to open 

\- smith probably",8
This move makes no sense from a team perspective but from my perspective I love it,6
Just reminded me of when they walked out to open against the windies and the stone cold music kicked in,1
STONKS,4
I think RR decided to BS some match time,3
Just tuned in and Stokes opens??,4
Mildly related. Aus first class cricket looks to have it's first Kane Williamson influenced batsmen. [If this cover drive doesn't scream I grew up watching Kane Williamson nothing does](https://twitter.com/cricketcomau/status/1315151114677841921?s=09),3
Calling an 8-6 wicket win for RR,3
If RR is keen to play Uthappa either open with him or replace him with Vohra who is reliable middle order batsman,7
Bairstow to chat shit to Stokes - love the see the battle of the gingers,10
Should‚Äôve sent robin uthappa no matter what. Give him the role of the anchor. Give him some confidence for god‚Äôs sakes!!! He is a good cricket just lacking confidence!!!!!!!!,4
Only Warne is funky enough to open with Stokes.,3
Cute helmet relay Dave to Kanos to Beary,2
Im loving this,3
"And if y'all about him playing slow, you haven't seen him play",2
Praveen Kumar approves.,2
I am pretty sure this is the idea of Warnie. Cricketing genius,2
Wtf is happening in this game lmao,1
"Stokes- Buttler combo *works*

YJB [ chuckles ] I‚Äôm in danger.",13
Bairstow up to the stumps to a seam bowler with Stokes batting is something I never expected to see,8
"Stokes Butler keeper standing up to the wicket, if you're just tuning in, this is the first over of the chase",8
Why TF is Stokes opening???,2
They are gonna finish this in 12 overs.,5
"Petition to mute the commentators and turn up stump mic

I wanna hear YJB chatting shit to Stokes & Buttler",24
This is memes,9
MyWorld Cup hero‚Äôs batting togetherüòçüòç. Add in Jonny and Jofra and you‚Äôve got nearly all the main players of Englands win on the pitch at the same time,9
Imagine someone telling you at the start of the year that Stokes and Buttler will open the batting together in both Test Cricket and the IPL,16
"Bowl a bouncer, Sandeep. XD",3
The comments on the Hotstar livestream are hilarious,3
Khaleel is gonna go full body line and pick 6 wickets ‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è,5
"Stokes and Buttler opening? What is this a test match? 

Joe Root t20 mastermind at it again",20
"Stokes said he would rather be in Quarantine than bat after Uthappa, so Smith made him open",62
They'll blow away SRH today,3
"We have a weak middle order. So let's send our only good middle order batsman up the order! ~ Smith, probably",5
But but what about Robbie?,5
"First over of the innings. A ""pacer"" bowling. And, the wicketkeeper is standing up to the stumps!!

Kind of feels wrong.",8
Uthappa and Parag are playing while Vohra is on the bench. Brain-dead team selection by RR.,5
They sent Ben stokes for batting practice as an ultimate diss to this Srh bowling lineup.,3
Khaleak c'mon,3
[deleted],6
justice for Robin,1
Why doesn't more batsman come down the track like stokes while playing the new ball? It helps to negate swing right?,2
Apparently Tom Moody called it earlier that RR might open with Stokes today.,9
As a fan of cricket I love the move of opening with Stokes. Get to see something new and anticipate something exciting. Certainly helps the ratings.,8
Ma boy Al-khaleel,5
"RR Management:

Play Robin Uthappa.

Make him bat in the middle order, knowing that he's well suited at the top.

Try Smith/Stokes at top.

Drop Uthappa for not performing.

And there the experiment has failed miserably. 4d chess blunder.,3
Disgusting,4

Don‚Äôt try that again RR,5
Need to get rid of Smith quickly too. Can‚Äôt have a good player of spin.,3
"**1.2** Ahmed to Stokes, OUT, **played on!** There's more evidence of a slow pitch. It's a short ball climbing away outside off. He shuffles and wants to pull through midwicket but it's off the inside edge and onto leg stump. Khaleel is overjoyed, and who wouldn't be with this wicket? **7-1**

Needed some stability ffs,1
Next match again plzzz,1
Smith and Samson out before power play? D√©j√† Vu.,5
Where are the rr fans in the chat? I mostly see Srh fans,5
Lmao at all those saying this will be chased by 6 overs,9
It took Lord Khaleel to bring down BC,4
Have RR considered the 37D chess move of opening with... an opener?,11
There was just too much ginger in there that‚Äôs why both Bairstow and Stokes couldn‚Äôt get going today.,3
Meat is not on the menu for the Sharjahistan boys.,8
"Vohra the guy who hit a 50+ score in an all important final in 2014 is playing vs the Utthappa who's inability to get going has cost teams matches over the years.

2000 IQ move",8
"Sending Stokes to open is a good move when you have finishers. Now RR's batting line up is just Buttler, Samson and Smith. The law of averages suggest Samson will score in double digits today but I don't expect him to score more than 30.",6
Ah heck... Was hoping to see a Stokes-a-thon,1
Yeah play stokes at the opening and Uthappa in the middle order. Then wonder why y‚Äôall lost,13
seriously no uthappa -_- has to be one of the selfiest captain ever,5
Thought Archer would come now smh,18
Can't help feeling Smith now is a bad idea. Should've sent Samson,7
Khaleel peaked. He should retire,36
Suddenly Khaleel is looking like Starc.,5
"Smith : Will you open Stokesy?

Stokes : Well yes, but no.",12
Would the Indian Team Management give Suryakumar Yadav a chance to play T20. Surya is someone who could replace Pandey in the team. He has a higher strike rate than Pandey and can field just as well as Pandey,8
"Stoke scores 5 in 6 , Robbie be like *yeh to main bhi kar sakta tha*",12
Khaleel is back,6
"As much as he's form has regressed in recent times, Uthappa was a great opener for us. He can easily play role of an anchor around the likes of Sanju, Smith, Butler and Stokes.",7
I swear if Lara played IPL he would have killed it,6
Friendship with Pandey ended. Khaleak is my bff now,11
"Stokes seems like the kind of player who sees IPL as just a cash opportunity and doesn't really give it his all. At least compared to the effort he puts in for England.

Some players don't give me that impression like Warner, Kane, Archer.",9
Can‚Äôt wait for the day stokes leaves RR and joins MI.,6
I'm hoping from Smith here to be him just one time or we're out of this tournament,3
I like watching all the best players batting at the top before the lower tier players.,2
"Robbie: you couldn't live with your own failure, where did that bring you? Back to me.",12
"Lol insult to uthappa, he's not even coming 1 down",9
Lmao they are risking S Smith to save Uthappa for Rashid,19
"Half of r/cricket: he should open the innings because he needs the practice after the break

Other half of r/cricket: He has not had much practice. Bad move to have him open.",16
Should we pick Nadeem as pitches are slowing down?,2
Stop giving me hope damnit,2
SMith needs to work the ball around give Buttler the strike,2
"Uthappa 
Yashaswi 
Samson
Smith
Buttler 
Stokes 
Tewatia
This should be the batting order of Rajasthan Royals",-6
Whose genius idea was it to open the batting with Stokes? Wtf?,9
"On the other hand, what a treat it would be to see both Russell & Stokes play together for KKR.",6
Great analysis by Lara,2
Brian Lara is such a good guy.,7
"Srh is only team that has beaten delhi this season , if we played kanos from the beginning and bhuvi didnt get injured , we would have had a way better chance at winning :(",13
Commentator: *If you wake him up at 2 in the morning*  - This is such an indian thing to say,9
RR just pulled a KKR off,1
Think it's a decent move to open with Stokes but you've gotta give him a couple of games to find form. No runs today doesn't mean it was wrong,8
If only Lord Khaleel played for NZ they would have won that WC that day.,5
[removed],7
So many shitty moves by RR.I miss Paddy Upton,3
"Sees Stokes as opener: Yeah.. This is a really positive move. Smart move. 

Sees Stokes get out quickly: Why would you send a finisher to play the brand new ball? Brain dead decision making.",67
Stokes was better option than Jaiswal who was batting low on confidence but seriously????,8
Stokes opened why?,4
CSK batsmen watching this: so you're telling me batsmen can *run between wickets*?,5
Sit down Bangar,1
"Sanjay is really not good at articulating, he has valid points though",11
"Since bhuvi is gone, for Khaleel it‚Äôs - with great responsibility comes great power",7
Can you get IPL stats from statsbot ?,1
Are we going to see a Smith special today?,1
Love the spirit of the SRH team. Vocal support ftw!,5
What is with the commentators obsession with waking up Kanos and Smith in the middle of the night and make them play? Let them sleep ffs,6
Which moron has sent BS to open the innings? LOL.,9
r/cricket's reactionary experts with hindsight bias at it again,12
"It may not have come off but it‚Äôs a ballsy move not only sticking Stokes to open having not played in 3 months but to face up first ball as well.

Also quite glad it didn‚Äôt come off, don‚Äôt want Ed Smith getting any ideas about the Test squad.",8
Labuschagne for CSK. Serious Hussey vibes,4
Why are they showing KXIP vs KKR last over? Cruel bastards.,5
RR have a stupid management and a stupid captain. They have some great players but foolish decisions by people at the top makes them ineffective. At least use your common sense Smith-Mcdonald combo.,1
I think SRH has the best coiffeur/groomer among IPL teams. CSK the worst,5
The only time Stokes played well in IPL was when he was in the same team as Dhoni. Coincidence? I think not,6
"162 runs off being as good as Marnus today Smithy, dont let him have the 11th of October over you",2
So RR* buys an opener in Uthappa and a finisher in Stokes and then reverse their roles so that none do well? Genius!,9
Lmao we got stokes,1
How are people saying that Stokes opening was a good decision that didn't pay off today. He's the only pure middle order batsman they have. A guy who can turn the game in their favor in the middle. Why open with him?,7
"Ball crosses the inner circle..
DJ: where are those crowd noises",4
I think dugout is better than regular commentary. A lot of explanation about technical things,5
Good chance Shane Warne was the brain behind Stokes opening the batting,4
"Year after year, the Sunrisers come in as underdogs, show passion for the game, and win just enough to be dangerous.

Loved this team since it was Deccan Chargers circa 2008",13
"Manish Pandey batting ahead of Kane Williamson.

RR Management trying players at positions they are not suited at.

CSK playing Murali Vijay. 

For me the 3 worst decisions of this years IPL.

Edit : Fellow redditors making me realise KXIP have taken many abysmal decisions and it's hard to compare them.",0
Youd swear the commentators had never seen Smith before the way they're surprised at his technique,2
Well sending Stokes as an opener was neither here nor there kinda decision.,3
"Hello guys I am back after a week ban

Felt like ages storing all the shitposting inside me all the week long.

Also no one cares",6
"Hasn't played in months...and, put Stokes to open. Dumb logic.",3
"Poor captaincy by Smith, Uthappa has won matches when given opening, he won't be of much use in middle overs",1
"Yeah, Stokes opening did not come off. Wasnt the worst idea though. The pitch is already slow and likely to slow further. Saving your power hitters for the end when it will be difficult to hit might not be ideal",6
Shocking captaincy from Smith to send Stokes for the opening. You have Mr. Robbie Uthappa who's most comfortable playing at the top order yet you make Stokes open! Both of them are playing out of position now. Dumb captaincy.,5
RR management is a joke. no point to rant about them. Just watch them burn.,3
NATUUUUUU wicket pls,3
"Nats back, twitchy guy can play you well. Take care buddy",4
Why doesn't uthappa open?,0
God damn I love SRH. The seniors support the youngsters. The youngsters are calm and don't let their emotions out easily.,3
"So Stokes arrived in the UAE yesterday, and RR decided to shove him in as an opener like a kid who‚Äôs finally got their favourite toy...",1
"We already had the experimental idea of Buttler opening from RR, please for the love of fucking God don't put the same for Stokesy in the mind of ECB selectors heads. Fucking hell.",4
Absolutely nailed,2
Stop bowling short,3
"Don't really understand the hate boner for bangar, he is diagonally opposite to swann in terms of commentary styles, being very dry. With styris being in the middle. Good combo this",3
How is Nattu's economy still above 8 despite those beautiful yorkers,2
Get Butler or we are fucked.,2
I‚Äôm about to get a heart attack every time either of them attempt a risky shot,2
Sandeep really be the first off spinner with a long ass run up,4
Butler spanks the ball so nicely,1
Damn what a shot,1
Bruh why bowl short on these slow pitches when the Yorker worked just fine,1
Man Nat should stop bowling it short and stick to his strength of Yorkers,3
"Nattu should stick to his strengths, and not bowl short",3
"Medium pace bowler, bowls bouncer to butler in powerplay what could gone wrong? 

Again bad length from NAT",2
"They play shorty's well Nattu, you nut!",2
This seems like a game where Law of Average shall haunt Nattu.,0
Nattu stick to your strengths,3
Best thing about seeing Buttler bat is that wiggly dance he does before facing any ball,7
Buttler can single handedly win the match here,4
"Buttu vs Nattu , a battle I can get behind",8
Thats one of the flatest six I have ever seen,6
Suicidal,5
"Is he out,? Good job NAT.",4
Out,5

Peak RR. Absolute peakedness.,1
Brain dead!,2
Intense competition between RR and CSK for the 6th spot,2

Mods put the live option on the thread plz yar,2
now watch samson get out for a duck,7
No uthappa feel bad for him shittiest management,4
Haha! Smith was running like a cartoon.,3

No wonder he is 3D",5
"Smith can just fuck off with all his unnecessary stupidity. Getting fed up with this. If he's to throw away his wicket so easily, why the fuck he bat at 1 or 3? Please bat at 2 down for teams fucking sake.",6
they shouldn‚Äôt have gone for that second run after hesitating for so long,4
Natarajan bowled those two short balls to tempt Buttler into keeping the strike which led to the runout.,6
Yes boys,6
Should have opened with Uthappa,7

Honestly being so heavily reliant on the foreign players is bad. The Indian players have so much more to gain from performing well in the IPL. Foreigners are here just for the money. Indian players especially uncapped have much more to prove. Reason why MI have done so well. They always a lot of young uncapped players.,14

Next 5 runs are crucial for Samson. He either scores 70s or gets out in single digits. Nothing in between,5
Warner had Samson in Dream XI team and sent Abhishek to bring him back in form. Samson can be bogged down by quality spin (Rashid) early on but 5th bowler will make him comfortable.,3
"Saini, Nattu bowling gives me a lot of hope, futures lookin bright",9
After the first two matches Samson has been very careful and defensive whereas in the first two matches he was really explosive. Maybe that's the reason he did not perform good in the previous few matches. His strength is in attacking maybe should do that.,2

Good thing I'm not an umpire",6
Rashid you glorious bastard. Worst case: Umpire's Call?,5
"He gave out? They will review it, umpires call OUT

Otherwise not out",9
Not out,2
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs out,3
"On one hand, I am an SRH suppoter.

On the other, I am sick of teams batting first and winning, and a loss for RR here could make the playoffs race pretty boring. Plus, I have a soft spot for RR.",11
"They should save Rashid‚Äôs overs imo

Edit: lol clearly Rashid knows better than me",7
I love Indian batsmen redemption (those who aren‚Äôt in the current playing XI),8
Kya tatti team hai by God,11
LETS GOOOO,3
Abhishek Sharma is wasting his looks as a spin bowler.,11
Even with three big wickets RR seems to be doing good,5
Strategic time usually brings a wicket,5
"Seems like its missing leg.

Edit: Never this glad to be that wrong.",4
Review lost,11
I think he's gone. Out hitting leg .yeeesss,5
[deleted],7
Thappa gone!,7
Nvm LETS GOOO,3
I hate timeouts,6
Rashid u beauty,7
Woah. That looked not out Live. But plumb on the Ball tracker,11
"Maybe umpire call on hitting leg

Edit: nvm",6
I stand corrected,8
"People who are crying, how many times in the last 2 years have you seen stokes succeeding at the finisher role in the ipl? He‚Äôs an great odi finisher because you get a little extra time to get set and go.",8
Gone!,3
Anti climax; they both were looking so damn good,12
YRKFA!!!,5
"Rashid tastes blood now, take more wickets my man.",7
"Thought it'd be umpires call at best on hitting tbh

Very surprised it was 3 reds",2
Geeli pappi to Rashid,7
"Rajasthan have such a good team on paper: Buttler, Smith, Stokes, Samson, Archer. Can't believe they're gonna be the RCB of this year and just crash out in the groups.",3
Man I was just coming to say that Uthappa and Samson looked pretty comfortable,5
It did look like not out fr,9
Uthappa being selfish. Didn't even consult the non-striker,6
Everytime SRH gets a dollar when Rashid performs for SRH.... we can easily buy out the 3D 2 times over,10
Graeme Swann seems happier then whenever he sees the Altroz,4
"Such chutiyappa from Uthappa.

He should have known that Rashid's first delivery would be a googly.",4
Guys upvote the match thread so more people can access it easily,3
"Omg hold it Hyderrabad fans, extreme reverse jinxing on reviewing too LOL",4
"**9.1** Rashid Khan to Uthappa, OUT, **trapped on the back foot and he reviews the lbw decision.** Good length ball, seems like a conventional legbreak. But no, replays show that pitched on middle before sliding onwards to leg stump, where Uthappa is caught on the pad trying to play the glance as this keeps a touch low. It's three reds on DRS and he's gone straight after the break **63-4**

RV Uthappa lbw b Rashid Khan 18 (15b 1x4 1x6) SR: 120.00",3
Rashid is a legend,2
"my mom: ‚Äúyeh logon ne decide kiya hai kya, aaj haarne ka hai‚Äù",4
What the fuck is the point of timeouts,2
You reckon Adil Rashid's at home upset that YJB has a new favourite Rashid?,5
[The power of reverse Jinx!! ](https://reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/j91jbf/match_thread_26th_match_sunrisers_hyderabad_v/g8h9smc?context=3),4
Ppl rly get out to rashid even when they are not trying to hit. That‚Äôs the difference between a good and a phenomenal spinner,8
I want Graeme Swann as my hype man.,8
"Lmao gets Uthappa especially for Rashid, and he gets out of Rashid. Whatever RR does, we can't win. Used all our luck in that Tewatia knock.",5
"Rashid is gonna stay at SRH for another decade at this rate, given his age lmao",13
Lmao the Gaurav Kapur and Amitabh Bachchan ad's LBW was literally a copy of the one Rashid just got Uthappa out,6
"Finally Uthappa was playing well, sad, hope they don't drop him in next match",3
Lmao stupid review,7
Sanju will hole out at long off eventually,4
They tried to save utappam by sending stokes up the order. Still Rashid got him,5
The timeout messed up our rhythm :( . All on Samson now,3
"Uthappa is like those snakes tablets you buy with firecrackers in Diwali, they take too long to burn out, lots of smoke and in the end it‚Äôs just a pile of shit",11
Ever since Samson turned down that single to Lord Tewatia his IPL has gone downhill. Karma,10
Could have sent Tewatia. He is in form and takes a bit of time to start hitting.,5
I like Strategic Timeouts. Benefits bowlers in a batsman's game,0
Riyan Parag trying to channel MSD but Idek if that's a good thing anymore :(,2
"If at all, give Rashid a wicket in the fourth over. If he gets a wicket in the first over or two...he becomes unplayable.",4
"Going down, don't waste a review",1
Missing leg,1
"Out umpire bc , should have given it.",1
"For all the inconsistency talk everyone knows if he sticks around and gets set Samson can take the game away.

Reason why they have deployed Rashid to take him out and kill the game",1
"Bat @ 7 rpo next 5 overs , no need to take unnecessary risks and they could still take it deep",1
Similar ball,1
missing turned too much,3
Its a good thing that RR doesn't have any fans. No toxicity when they messes up .,6
Instead of aiming for boundaries keep taking those ones and twos without any dot balls..that is enough to put pressure on the bowling team,1
That looked so so close,0
Still can't get over yesterday's matches. Punjab losing by an inch. CSK making 47 runs after 10 overs chasing 170.,8
"Idk guys, I think missing leg",2
"Warner's T is shocking

Should be stripped off the captaincy",3
"Warner threw away that review, clear leg side",5
You shouldn't get to bat without a helmet or cap if you're not an international capped player.,4
"Shot review, unless umpires call",2
Max umpire call,1
Fuck missing leg stump.,4
Missing leg imo,3
Missing leg,2
"No one, absolutely no one                                                                 Simon Doull- He is a gambling man",4
That's a terrible fuckin review,7
[deleted],-2
Not out,2
How do we convince Rashid to get Indian citizenship?,7
Looks easy not out.,3
Clearly missing damn it,2
Wasted review,3
Finally straight to ball tracking.....ty,3
Shit.,2
This umpire is good. Two good decisions.,11
Ughh review lost,6
Both sides lose their review lmao,3
Srh wasted their review as well,7
This umpire seems to be really good,7
Missing leg,2
"Yes, smart umpire. Going directly to ball tracking.

Not waiting for an ultraedge in obvious cases.",8
Two reviews burned in same over,2
"Good thing about watching spinners bowl this ipl, do not have to hear Nehra talking about how length delivery is the best option.",4
Very good umpiring. Appreciated,6
Village review,5
Garbage review imo,12
rashids making his case for the emerging player award more stronger now.,7
that manish pandey innings doesn‚Äôt look so bad right now huh?,6
"Shit review man , oh God. We don't even have reviews left. Fuck.",4
Good guy Warner for wasting the SRH review so that we're now even.,9
Rashid is goddamn unplayable,4
Sanju sanson hota to review ka sense banta h re ye random parag p waste kar diya,4
YRK,3
Good umpiring. If the umpire had given this out RR would have been screwed without review,4
"I like this umpire. Rare to come across a confident looking Indian umpire. 

2 bad reviews BTW",11
that was a large margin lmao,3
Do we have stats of how many reviews umpires overturned or something like that wrt reviews?,4
It's time to perform 3D boi,5
Lord 3D here to shut you all up. See,6
[removed],4
Whoever convinced the world that Vijay Shankar is an all rounder is the biggest scammer in the world.,13
Sanju already set himself up for a wrong un while playing the last ball of Rashid. Now Rashid needs to bamboozle by bowling a leg cutter.,4
Umpires in weed since yesterday. Absolute fucking straight decisions,8
"Umpire got both LBW decisions spot on, fair play to him",8
Nepo gang,6
You want to save Rashid and a review for Tewatia,8
Samson‚Äôs their last hope,9
"Lmao who plays dot to Vijay shankar

Why tf did RR drop Mahipal Lomror",11
"Technology has come a far way, without 3D glasses we are witnessing the spectacle known as Shankar",12
"has Amit Shah played cricket, and at what level

six-forehead doesn't make you knowledgeable at cricket",8
Is that hippo Amit Shahs son?,9
Vijay Syonker,3
Shankar bowls absolute dollies and gets away easily,6
Jay Shah having the time of his life doing absolutely nothing.,11
"Yeah the RRR is nearly 10, Samson will now feel that he needs to get a move on and hole out to cow corner. i hope that I'm proven wrong.",10
I guess Manish Pandey wasn't that bad after all,10
"Guys, upvote the game thread for 'visibility'",9
Yashwant OP,5
Never risk a run against a Warner throw,6
please win rr,3
"Rashid has been brilliant this season. Only match where he was good but not great was against us where Shubman and Morgan played him brilliantly. Even though they were chasing a low score and had liberty to not attack him, they played his overs out well nonetheless.",10
I think I better watching French open as compared to this shit,0
"Honestly idc that they are getting singles of 3D, it could be much worse",2
Every dot ball a bowler balls - should be counted as a positive stat from him/her,3
Do you go with Rashid for the next over?? You'd think they'll keep him for the back end now. Bowl Sandeep I reckon.,2
Would've loved to have Stokes in the middle order in this kind of situation,10
Sandeep sharma to bowl next over,4
Why the fuck ganguly and jay shan are in UAE?,0
3D giving away only 5 runs.. pinching myself,4
Good comeback shankar,4
"RR should have retained Rahane, he was good openers for them",5
Miller isn't going to be playing unless Smith goes home frustrated to be with Marnus,7
T20 stats and bowling figures should showcase dot balls.,3
"Haha it could still go either way.

As much as I like test, t20s get my heart rate going",4
Only one remaining of 5th bowler go srh .....,1
3D Shankar is the real mystery bowler. Looking at his action and speed you'd feel he'll go for plenty but doesn't,3
"Fucked up batting order

Kkr ü§ù Rr",7
Expecting Samson to throw away his wicket now,1
"It is still ordinary total to chase this ,still need wickets",1
This is why we needed Stokes in the middle order wtf not for him to do what Jaiswal could have done just as well,4
Are they gonna bowl out Rashid?,3
"Right we now need a couple of 15 run overs to get us back into the game, preferably with Samson staying. The total is just too high though, I knew that we'd seriously struggle against anything over 140 on this pitch, especially against Rashid",1
Better throw and he would‚Äôve been gone,2
Andrew Tye winning the purple cap is a bigger travesty than Obama winning the Nobel peace prize,8
Why is samson running literally on the pitch,6
Good fielding effort,2
"Ohhhh fuck wide and a boundary. Looks bad, important runs for rr",2
"Is Stokes still Covid-gronked? Why isn't he playing?

Edit: I'm pleading the Smiff. Brain fade",1
Rashid Khan should be the most expensive buy ever in the IPL.,8
That's 4.,0
Now they will take 2 days to find out this,7
Through the legs!,3
Bairstow is a shitty keeper,-3
Nice save,6
give them the 4 RR need it,1
Good effort but is very comical.,7
That looks hilarious but he's done the job I think and that's what matters.,8
Wow that's ugly but impressive,8
KP's analysis makes my ears bleed.,8
LMFAO peak Khaleel,9
"That's some next-level commitment.

Would have been hilarious if he flicked it onto his balls.",8
MbUyt0N 2.0,6
"**Bowlers with most LBW dismissals in IPL**

That's not a wide either. Phew,4
Take Samson out,8
"Based on performance overall, maybe Buttler needs to be dropped, not Smith, to make way for Miller",4
How has he done that without dislocating all of his limbs?,4
"Much depends on tewatia and archer today , if they can both  strike at 130 they can still win this",8
"Khaleel is shat by many, including me,but he is giving it his all",13

Young Rashid khan strikes again,8
Very good catch by Jhonny,5

SRH are the absolute kings of the 160 defence. Just know what is to be done.,13
"Stellar effort, fielding continues to be amazing this IPL",2
RASHID!!,5
Best white ball spinner in the world,11
Feels like we are giving them the match.,5
Game over I think. Unless the Lord does something but this ain't Sharjah,5
Yes yes yes fuck u duck Samson,2
y‚Äôall were acting like we ever had a chance üò≠ lmfao fucking amateurs,6

"Double digits, moral victory for Samson fan's",19
Rashid is an abso-fucking-lute match winner,10
Hahaha Samsun you shit,0
yep that‚Äôs the game,8
Another typical SRH game. Post a total around 160. Choke the opponent batsmen in middle overs. Some good death bowling. And the match is yours.,10
Sanju consistently inconsistent Samson,4
"So, we gonna see an apology thread for Manish Pandey?",3
"That's the game, unless Tewatia decides to interrupt the proceedings",3
"better innings from Samson, not trying to tonk the bowling from go",8
Chad Tewatia vs Virgin Rashid who will win ?,3
Atleast He didn't go slogging blindly..wanted to take it deep.. Rashid bis just too good,3
That is the game there boys,1
These people don‚Äôt understand ‚Äúplaying out Rashid Khan‚Äù,7
Tewatia should come now,2
Lol I heard Lara saying young Bairstow.,6
RR looks like English plan to invade and occupy the IPL..LOL....too many freeloaders and none more than Butler and Stokes.,1
"RR fans put your bet, 50 run loss or 40 run loss?",1
Look at these fools writing off RR when their main batsman is yet to face a ball.,7
Might have a look at the tennis hey.,3
But Mallus Uaaee,4
Good thing I stopped supporting rr. No more heart aches,6
Rashid is going to be absolutely unplayable by the end of this tournament. Pitches gonna get real slow..,7
Some people on here owe Manish Pandey an apology üòÇ,2
Here comes the lord,2
Happy YJB is one of the best and rarest sights in world cricket,4
Abhishek Sharma ko bhi bowling dedo yaar usko na batting mili na bowling,2
Where is Stokes? Not playing today too?,2
What's up with the low comments? :(,4
Lord Tewatia has arrived,3
In before Tewatia takes it away from SRH,2
"Told you, Samson's one and done for the tourney",1
What a gun bowler!,1
All hopes on lord now,2
Hope ungrateful fucks who abused Pandey realize the value of his innings.  He should quit that franchise asap. He deserves better.,1
"Would Rashid be the most expensive player if he was ever to go into the auction? Lmao, serious question",2
The lord arrived bitches,6
Samson flattering to deceive thought the brother was going to be sensible against srh of all sides.,3
Nvm Stokes couldn't have saved this team anyway,3
Between KXIP and RR cannot decide which is the worse team this IPL,5
"I feel like batsmen treat Rashid with too much respect for very little reason. If you keep playing defensive prods against a leg spinner something's got to give. He's a great spinner, no doubt, but treating him like he's unplayable all the time isn't going to help you deal with him better.",5
Bowling Rashid for three consecutive overs paid off massively for SRH.,3
Wtf Tewatia.That's not gonna give much confidence to the viewers,3
"Pant is better than Samson because he‚Äôs been captained and coached better, too.",3
3D vs Lord a very very interesting battle,3
I love Rashid too much.,4
RR and KXIP are the worst teams by far,6
TEwatia got those eye drops from RPSG astrologer...,5
"5 wickets down with the run rate at 6-7 and the score below 100. It's happened so much this season that it's not even funny, we're worse than 2017/2018 RCB",3
Only thing remaining between win and SRH is Lord Tewatia,1
RAshid's 5'oclock shadow looks sprayed on,2
Tewatia saw Djokovic using eye drops in the game yesterday.,2
Need to clean the game properly here. Save Rashid‚Äôs last over and bring in Abhishek Sharma/Vijay Shankar to close out the overs.,3
Archer + Tewatia  = Game Over,5
Imagine stokes coming in at this position. What braindead person sent him to open,5
"Last over from a 5th bowler against the new batsman 

Good choice",1
"So that's it then? KXIP, RR and CSK are out, right?",2
Murali had that proud teacher moment,3
I'm still trying to figure out why Rashid Khan was so bad in the World Cup. He wasn't average or merely disappointing for his standards. He was flat out bad. Unfortunate. Could've won Afghanistan a game or two.,5
No idea why Samson is not playing all the 3 formats for India? Well here's why.,6
Nice to see Jonny pumped up good catch.,2
"The balance 3D gives to our side is just immense. Only if he can show up with the Bat as well, we'll be contenders this year.",8
"So it wasn‚Äôt either Samson or Uthappa‚Äôs redemption arc, it was just Rashid‚Äôs masterclass",3
If only RR had a specialist middle order batsman from England named Ben lol. Tough luck ig,9
"Bhenchod
How does rash do that",6
"Bairstow didn‚Äôt catch that, ball caught Bairstow",3
If Tewetia wins this then we need a new flair dedicated just to him,8
Save the last rashid over till the end just in case another partnership forms,2
CSK's matches make me really sad but after watching RR struggle even after having better team than us makes me happy.,3

Holy shit Tewatia üòçüòçüòçüî•üî•üî•,-2
Yeah RR are not scoring 80 runs in 8 overs against SRH,3
Tewetia forever will be defined by his 15 minutes of fame.,7
Archer is literally one man army for RR this year. Best bowler and prolly the one of the best batsman,6
"As far as I remember, there has been no stumping this season. That is a absurd stat.",10
Tewatia can do tewatia only against shit side like kxip,5

"Not gonna lie, 3D player had us for a section there",3
"Oof, almost carried",3
"Alright. Sorry for shitting on you Manish

Seeing this pitch, Pandey, Warner, Garg and Williamson all played blinders!",3
"Why is Samsung calling their phone ""Dy Dy Dy Dynamite""?",3
The team is as dead as the sub r/RajasthanRoyals,3

Nooo damn it would‚Äôve been showing off the 3D,1
"Our Lord at 7

Hallowed be thy name",5
Lord Tewatia VS Lord Shankar..,3
The match is pretty much done for when even 3d is also about to get a wicket,2

hope lord survives till next over,1
3D is the perfect definition of dibbly dobbly kind of bowler. He'll get away with his overs more often than not given his lack of pace.,5
"Started as a meme, but now Tewatia is literally our best batsmen",10
"I said maybe keep Archer for the death overs. Then he got Warner out. 

I said maybe keep Rashid for the back end. Then he got Samson out. 

I think I'll just shut up about bowling changes for a couple of days.",14

What are you doing Shankar?,3
This game is dead now lol give us MI vs DC already,-1
"After 3 matches each, it was 2-1 or 1-2 for every team. Now if SRH win this, it‚Äôs mostly just 3 teams competing for 2 slots",6
"lmao, actually a decent spell from Shankar.",10
What is with the random team generator of RR this year? Looks like RR and KXIP are fighting for the right to be the RCB of this year,12
Fuck this team. Shittiest team in the IPL. No common sense at all. Top 3 players all out in the Powerplay. 'Next Bradman' is batting and leading like a crack head. And they managed to form a squad with no  good Indian players except Samson. Fuck this joke of a team. Still supporting them but seriously fuck this stupid team.,13
"Rashid this tournament: 27-1-128-10
Eco 4.74",8
Rajasthan should have got Mark Wood(for base price) instead of Oshane Thomas,4
4.74 is good economy for ODI's let alone T20s,19
10 wickets for 4.74 is a joke,17
"How generous of my boy 3D, he sees the opposition is struggling making runs, so gifts them a few. At this rate he will soon become 4D if not already",8
That Rashid Khan economy is beautiful,5
Rashid has econ of 4.74 with 10 wickets!! Thats absurd,21
"One of us,one of us RR.

This IPL is between 5 teams MI,DC,SRH,KKR,RCB",5

On this day, however, Matty is sad. Sad for a whole lot reasons but none come close to the matter of his heart. Matty's heart is breaking today. And there is only one thing that can heal him. And like a bolt out of the blue, he hears him. The voice that heals all of his wounds, the visage of the true Australian hero. Bald, bearded, gaunt and gronked, Nathan Lyon's face illuminates the gray Tassie sky. Matty cranes his neck upwards, throat aching from the lack of use and screams, ""NICE GARRY!"" and Gaz smiles down, it's a nice day after all.",-1

"So that‚Äôs all 3D cricket for this match, all 2D from now",5
They might as well have played Jaiswal in the middle order rather than Parag. I think Parag was bought more for marketing and promotions rather than for his cricket.,5
Please bowl out Sandeep right now.,8
"Good effort shankar, he is giving 100% hope we continue playing him in next match. Good work in deep ,and gives good 3overs in the middle overs with Rashid on the other end",2
Nadal or Djoker?,-4
These guys have to face 2 overs of T 'Mitch Starc' Nataranjan,5
Both the set batsman gone and fifth bowler all bowled out. Surely SRH will back themselves now.,4
"Economy of 4 AND 2 wickets, Rashid is üêê",3
Hope Tewatia and Parag can coexist out there. I hear Tewatia is partial to Zubaan Kesari.,10

When are they going to show MI and DC players getting out of their Team buses and give Zero fucks about camera..,11
I love SRH and Warner's adherence to same plan when bowling. 2 overs each for the pace bowlers in the powerplay. 5th bowler bowling from one end starting 7th over while Rashid bowls  a 3 over spell. Then couple of pacers bowl an over each before Rashid comes back for 16th or17th over and innings ends with medium pacers.,6
Are we thinking Novak or Rafa at Roland Garos?,4
Now they're calling it ABILITY instead of INTENT,5
Lord Tewatia getting into his zone with those dots,8
Lord Tewatia smacked in Sharjah right..,3
"Turns out stockpiling Indian pacers was a smart move from SRH lmao

Budget bhuvi's been decent this year",17
I'd really love for someone to explain it to me why Rashid Khan is so good in this format.  I just don't understand technically why he's so hard to score against.,3
"So dc and mi are pretty much qualifying, kxip, csk and rr are out, so its just game between the remaining 3",3
Even without Bhuvi SRH are performing well. Good to see.,20
Lord Tewatia charging up..,3
RR is kedaralized,4
"Much as I love Rajasthan (perennial underdogs), they too, like KXIP, lack a solid core, and no, Sanju Samson does not count. You need an Indian international of some stature in the team. Too top-order reliant, and too unwilling to get their middle order in order.",4
Yasir Shah would have been great in IPL. Pity that politics keeps the pakistan players out,4
"Never would have thought a Bhuvi-Less SRH would be this successful tbh. Management/Coaching staff must really be a godsend, Sandeep is filling the void really nicely. I‚Äôm happy",4
Most probably Kane will not play for sunrisers after the mega auction. They'll retain Warner and Rashid. Then they'll have to pay huge price for Williamson (he'll go for more than 6CR IMO) which will be unlikely. So most probably a team like Chennai might pick him.,6
FFS RR win this and keep IPL alive,2
"SRH management might not be that bad, eh?",6
SRH need one decent finisher and a replacement for Bhuvi and they're set. I wonder if Shami will jump ship ..,2
"Csk, RR,KXIP so shit",3
I love how srh runs two in Sharjah but shuts others not allowing them not to run . Greedy bitches,7
Imagine Rashid with peak Narine in one team,5
"Jesus christ
So this is the SRH bowling attack without bhuvi",5
"Sandeep Sharma: ""*Oh fuck... my misfield costed one run*""

Inner Sandeep Sharma: ""*Thank god, lord Tewatia is off the crease now.*.""",14
Tewatia God Mode loading,7
"*CSK removes Kedar*

RR: Ab hum bhi kedar.",6
"Pretty interesting how pitches like these expose the flaws of modern T20 batsmen who rely on power over everything. Slow pitches force you to time the ball, there's no other way to tackle the issue. Your power means nothing if you can't time the ball. Hence why the likes of good technique in VK, Williamson and even Pandey actually did alright on this pitch.",4
You‚Äôd think RR would be better prepared for Rashid as Warne is their mentor but nope,3
"Warner is a GUN FIELDER. I see batsman just giving up on the 2nd run, just seeing him",8
Rashid Khan deserved 15.5 crores. Auction system broken,7
"Badrinath explaining knuckle ball beautifully in Tamil feed . More surface area in contact with the hand compared to the normal delivery ,so the  friction reduces the pace

Change of action is subtle compared to cutters and difficult to pick",4
Stability is what that is expected from Smith. He has not been able to provide that till now. No match awareness at all. It's weird saying this about Smith but Smith is being weird this IPL anyway.,4
What is Parag's role in this team?,1
Nataranjan is a rising star. I can see it.,3
"I remember us trying to get Shami in the 2018 mega auction. At that time, it seemed like a terrible decision. Now it's a wet dream",5
Can't believe I am saying this. It was a stupid decision by RR to let Rahane go. All teams need two captain figures.,5
I‚Äôm gonna make r/TewatiaCult a subreddit,3
Off-topic question: Narine bowled really well in the death in the previous 2 games. He rarely bowled in the death after he remodeled his action. Now he's been suspected. Did he just revert to his old action and hope no one would notice?,5
Thala effect,3
As a Rajasthani I feel it would be better to disband this team rather than continuing.,7
I no longer feel any pain. I am used to it now. It‚Äôs a part. It‚Äôs a part of being a RR supporter.,9
"Rashid is on another level this year. The pitches are really suiting him, has probably been hit fewer boundaries than he has wickets",3
So SRH is going third today?,1
Looks like sandy is the perfect replacement for bhuvi,3
narine+ rashid khan +archer+rabada +bumrah...how is this for bowling line up?,6
Please be out be out,2
"In this batting crazed format, I love it how Hyd is known for their Bowling",7
Rohit Sharma explaining the importance of mutual funds to Shreyas Iyer.,13
I sense a Tewatia incoming,2
49 minutes left for the big show.,2
Bowling yorkers always becomes diabolical,3
"This IPl is the Worst with KXIP,CSK and RR dropping out of the race so early",12
The Lord needs to get out in a much more dignified way,3
"Good commitment Nat, good fielding today.",4
Will there be an ultra edge for this too?,6
Why would you want to get Riyan Parag out?,3
We're reaching the Tewatia Threshold ‚Ñ¢ of the required run rate for him to go berserk. We believe.,6
RR and KXIP are literally memes masquerading as IPL teams.,5
Stopped watching this awhile back.  More interested in the comments. Thanks below for the explanations to my question about Rashid Khan,8
He touched it the question is if the batsman is in crease,7
The batsmen could be in. I tink the umpire should first check for that.,4
So much hype but DC vs MI gonna be one sided,5
"3 teams are putting of the tournament unless they turn around in the second half it looks like fight between two spots between RCB, SRH, KKR.",2
"Ohhhh, I just realized, Stokes played and already got out. Stupid me was still holding onto some hope.",13
"Who appointed the RR management lmao

Amol Muzumdar and Sairaj Bahutule didn't even play International cricket

And Andre McDonald to top it off",0
Surely they can run it right through and see if he's actually out of his ground first before fucking around with whether or not he touched it?,3
Not out? :(,3
No ultraedge for hand?,5
Quick! Start shitting on Tewatia again. He feeds of the negativity on r/cricket. Let's meme him back to form bois. Again.,8
He's inside anyway you muppet,10
He grounded his bat why all this drama,8
He's in anyway,2
What a waste of time,9
"I honestly cannot tell if he's touched it

Don't think he has but it's hard af to tell",1
He was inside anyway,8
Bruh man spent 5 minutes looking at if the ball hit the finger or not. Whole time Parag had actually made his ground anyway,10
"Tewatia batting with SR in 50s

Warning bells for Srh",15
First check too see if the batsman is on crease lmao,7
RR and CSK are cut from the same cloth this year.,9
"Told ya, 150+ will be too much for us",7
Take a moment to appreciate the yorker,5
"This is retarded, he actually made it back to the crease. So why waste 30 mins checking if the bowler touched the ball?!",7
Parag was safe anyway lmao,9
FFS.... backward ass decision making. First figure out if the batsman is in or out before wasting time with the stupid camera tricks,13
Swann hates the 3rd umpire so much,19
Fingergate. Hahaha,4
Jfc! What a farce ü§¶üèª,2
Why give so many singles in the same area,3
That deflection was clear af lol,1
"I really hope the same standards of ""contact"" are made in these situations as in situations where they're determining if the fielder is touching the ropes.",2
"as someone here just said, if you want tewatia to pull a tewatia, you gotta start shitting on hihm first smH",3
Natarajan is a beast. Hopefully the RTM card that we need to use is for below a 3 Crore amount.,3
"Put on Chris Jericho's music

SAVE_US_LRD_TEWATIA",2
I actually agree with swaney for once. 3rd umpires hadn‚Äôt thought through that one,4
The third umpire spent all that time on whether or not the bowler touched the ball when the batsman was in the crease when the ball hit the stump. Wasting time.,3
"Parag is I think now the player with most balls faced in this IPL without hitting a six , Close to that accolade anyways.",3
"Sunrisers won't be able to hold on Natarajan next draft

Srini will get him to CSK, by giving his relative VP of Cement",5
[removed],3
Nattu is relentless. What a find for SRH.,8
"Serious question, why do people keep saying ‚ÄúMI is 100% in‚Äù when they‚Äôre in the exact same position as KKR and RCB?? They have a better run rate, sure, but it‚Äôs way too early for that to matter - it could completely collapse by the end of the tournament, or KKR/RCB could increase theirs. Only team that seems ‚Äú100%‚Äù in rn is Delhi who are a clear cut above the rest",3
What do you think rr would be strategising in this time out?,4
"7:26 for the MI vs DC match, why?",5
"Tewatia can't make RR win. What he did at Sharjah was once in a lifetime innings against meme team and at a postage stamp ground.

It is not fair to expect that kind of innings everytime.",13
"There‚Äôs not much that RR can actually do with this current squad. Just need Samson, Smith and Butler to step up and perform like how Archer is doing with the ball. I still think if they get back into form they would be incredibly tough to beat as they five genuine match winners.",5
I love how Paul Reiffel doesn't give a shit about signalling the Strategic Timeout properly,7
"I don't know why they aren't following the basics. 
Should have let Uthappa open along with Butler, then Smith, then Samson, then Stokes. 
They have one the best no. 5 and they tell him to open.",8
"Evidence was inconclusive.

Director should have shown the umpire the snicko.",6
Rahul Devuduwatia false god. Downvote me,8
What's up with these mutual fund adverts?,1
"Not loving this Americanisation of British TV adverts tbh

Don't wanna see adverts for medication (at least I think it's that) for erectile dysfunction on TV ffs",5
"You have a player who plays number six for his international side and has a reputation of pulling them out of trouble all the time, and co-incidentally you need exactly that kind of player since you already have world class batsmen at the top but no experience in the middle order, so what you do?

Obviously you make him open the innings.",10
Which over would Rashid bowl? I'd go 18th,1
Just realized that this was Samson's 100th ipl game.,1
All round bowling from SRH,1
RR are sort of a management if they were into football they'll play Ramos as a striker because he's a good header.,5
Tewatia needs only 11 balls to chase this down..,3
"Ppl are saying MIvDC is an important game but it‚Äôs really not. Interesting? Sure

Bc regardless of who win in that one they are both gonna make it to playoffs. This game is more important than anything bc both teams are in contention for play offs",2
"SRH choices should be clear for the next maga auction. 

Retain: Warner, YJB, Rashid Khan

RTM: Nattu, Bhuvi",5
Just an interesting question: did DC transfer Rohit sharma in an inside deal back in early 2010s?,1
Who will Tewatia hit 5 sixes off this time?,2
"Rooting for tewatia to hit 5 sixes off Rashid

De ja vu for both batsman n bowler",7
Khallu mama please don't leak now.,3
9 more dot balls before he starts blasting I recon,2
They'll be showing Tewatia's innings for years to come,3
"Warne tweeted before the start of the innings that RR will win with two overs to spare.

So they need 65 in 3 overs",5
big over alert.. y‚Äôall trolling. these guys are gonna be taking singles till the very end,5
"RRR of 13+, 5 down, and RK has an over left. Safe to say RR is out of the game at this point?",3
"YJB to Pandey: It‚Äôs okay, dont MC BC him",2
Tewatia to hit 45 sixes in 6 balls and win RR all their games this season.,3
Match will be decided by Tewatia vs Rashid,3
"Lmao Tewatia was an one time wonder. Can't smash anything other than half trackers with medium pace


(Tryna get some life into this dead game)",4
Retire outDevuduwatia. Archer is still to come,1
Why is there so much blue/shades of blue in IPL uniforms but so little red? Red is so dominant among sports teams but only KXIP has red in their uniform,1
"Khaleel is performing after getting dropped. Pandey also started performing in 2019 after getting dropped. Maybe a kick up the backside is needed sometimes. If Samson keeps stuttering, maybe one game off might help him.",2
"Lmao that was shockingly bad

Didn't even get close to catching it in the end",2
Tewatia needs pies to pull off what he did against Punjab. Bowlers serving those here is highly unlikely.,1
I want Bairstow to go for higher numbers in the next auction. One of the few foreign Batsmen who play good in the IPL. SRH may as well retain him.,2
Ughhh,2
"Sorry Mr Garg, you're out of the **SPECIALIST FIELDER‚Ñ¢** academy.",5
shoulda caught that üòñ,3
Garg3 what was that? It should be taken 10/10 catch,6
Gargle didn't swallow it,6
Garg of all people.,2
Wow! This season it's either been catches like Samson's or dropping sitters!,1
RR always ends up in a situation where they need Tewatia to pull a Tewatia.,7
they always drop off Khaleel's bowling,2
Handful of fresh air for Garg Indeed,4
In other news- rafa broke djokos serve,3
Imagine SRH with a genuine 5th bowler. We‚Äôd be able to defend anything lowkey,3
That could have been a costly catch,0
Khaleak actually bowled Great this game!,3
3d chess from SRH .. Dropping this is a good move,10
"If they don't put away next 2 deliveries  , it's over",2
Better Parag over the 200+ SR Archer.,3
How many balls since the last boundary?,2
Bangar who called wicket alert died a little,2
Gotta accelerate now. Still have one Rashid over left,7
DC and MI have the best teams at the moment and they are playing to their potential.  The RCB team that played against CSK looked balanced.  I I think they got  their playing 11  in order. KKR looks good too and they have been a bit lucky. I think they sucked away all the luck Kings IX had.,2
Dropped so that Jofradamus doesn‚Äôt come in,5
"Riyan Parag was fire last season. What happened?

Edit: Hopefully that's the start",4
"RR cant you win one fucking game, now we gonna drop to 5th position",11
Pretty much every ball has been in the air,5
Not boasting but I feel I can play 10 times better than Parag.,-8
Archer is probs  better than parag in this situation. That dropped catch might not be bad,3
PARAG 6 ALERT,1
Oh c'mon Khaleel. Was just praising you,3
Khaleel getting Khaleel treatment. There's still hope in this universe.,4
Bencint van Stokes,4
Riyan Parag hits a six. Surprises even himself.,7
"Yeah that catch gonna come back and bite our ass,smh.",7
Uthappa is happy because everyone is playing shit in RR.,9
Tewatia and Samson played memorable innings at Sharjah but it was mostly because of boundary size,7
"uthappa finally doing what he was supposed to do.
cheering and supporting youngsters.",7
Tewatia show starts now...,5
Parag : So any way I started blasting,6
"TFW you realise Buttler, Stokes and Archer are stuck at RR for life",11
Has Madlads mode been activated?,8
Garg dopping Parag lol,3
It's the hope that kills you.,4
oof that sound of the bat,4
This over is what rr needs to attack if they want a change,4
[deleted],1
Man you can never trust khaleel Ahmed can you,4
takatak ad is the cringiest thing ever and I hope everyone who acted in that get itchy bums.,1
Let's goo Tewatia,3
He's saving Rash for way too long. Defensive captaincy.,6
So it begins.,5
Lord Tewatia has arrived,8
SRH fans sweating now,8
"I get a feeling lord will smack Sandeep....

Cotrell vibes Bois",3
"Tewatia could retire or something. At least Jofra can smash a few 

As I type: *it's working guys*",0
Big over coming up üö®üö®,3
"Damn, please LORD.. nooooo!!",2
This looks bad man,2
Noo......,2
It's happening!!!,5
"Tewatia joins the show

SRH letting it get away from them a touch here

This is still very chaseable",2
It has begun,3
Over bowling the slower balls. Need some variation,2
oh laawd he comin,6
48(23) seems hella easy now,4
"Bro cmon, Where's Rashid",1
Batsman doing a Tewatia...,1
Right lads time to start blasting.,1
Now the chase is interesting,1
Tewatiya sixes are a marvel to look at.,1
Well shit!! Fasten your seatbelt.,1
"BC that catch, haat.",1
"RR should fire Smith from captaincy, give Warne the return ticket to Melbourne and make Samson the captain.",3
"If Rajasthan wins from here, their whole season would be turned around.",3
Wtf should‚Äôve given to rashid,1
"Sandeep, you have been chosen.",1
Here we go.,1
Rahane must be the happiest player in the IPL even though he didnt get a single game,3
bruh.,4
"If RR pulls this chase

They r my fourth team for playoffs",5
It‚Äôs all fun and games until Rashid shows up,9
go go go Tewatia...,2
"The LORD arrives , now I think Rashid will come in next over",8
F foe the person saying they'd pick garg solely for his fielding,4
I wouldn't even be mad if it was Tewatia that hit the winning runs. I just love the dude.,9
But this isn't KXIP.,6
Dont give me that hope. No. We dont deserve to win any matches with our shitty top order,11
Can we revamp the whole franchise like Delhi.. become Rajasthan Rompers or something,17
DEVUDUTHALAKINGWATIA,4
Tewatia on strike and no Rashid??,10
19 in last 8 balls. We r fucked,7
don't worry guys Lord Tewatia has a plan,2
"He can hit along the ground too, my lord and savior!",4
Why they sucking his dick?,8
Jay Shah now wearing a mask. Mist have got a call from his father.,10
Rashid Natu khaleel after this,2
"As I said,  He can't hit anything other than slow half trackers.",1
Abey sandeep leave it for Jonny . He could have thrown it,2
Parag needs to hit or go,2
"I told you, it ain't over until the Lord says so.",3
We are throwing away the match.,4
Rashid should have bowled this over,1
Should have caught that,1
Sandeep Sharma has the same facial hair since the dawn of IPL,4
What is the cheer?,3
Should have brought in Rashid Khan,3
And thus the Lord gave unto them the runs to win the match,4
Fuck Nepotism and Jay Shah. I am with edgy r/india users for once,15
Got too cocky SRH,4
Why short?,3
SRH fucked up,3
Amit shah might have sent a Maqbool to protest Jay Shah..,3
"Yikes

This over from budget bhuvi might be the game changer",5
Sandeep undoing all the work wtf,4
Benchod sandeep asking to hit him. Shit delivery. Fuck off,6
Lord sandeep making sure it will not be a borefest,4
Aw a little harder and it would've gone,2
I don't think they can do it but holy fucking shit it'll be a good finish.,2
what are we doing,3
That shot tho nicely hit,3
Better bring in Rashid!!,3
Parag is punching above the waist. Quite impressive!!,5
Dafuq is Sandy doing here,8
Fucking hell you cunts don't lose it now,11
Losing this,5
Match isnt over yet boys,3
Riyan Parag remembering he can hit big shots.,7
What a shot,5
They're doing it!,2
"2 uncapped Indian bois doing it.

Pleases me a lot.",7
This is not the sandeep I know....he was known for his death bowling while in Punjab.,6
Seriously,1
Don‚Äôt choke boys,6
Very doable,3
TWO BIG BALLS,2
"Parag is firing here

Rashid has to bowl next over and kill the game",2
"Shouldn't they try send Uthappa as opener? After all, he is an opener",3
So did teams just forget how to chase or what?,2
17 runs benchod haat. Sharam kar bc. Chutiya bowling,0
pan parag de villiers four of the match.,6
Interesting batting here. Riyan showing intent.,4
"Just wow, all credit to the batsman, great intent and skill.",5
Fucking sandy...,2
Parag is spreading his pheromones!,6
Oh ho ho ho hoooo üò¨,1
Come on rr,1
Arre sandy mc,2
Oh no..what have you done sandeep,3
No. Im not raising my hopes up :(,4
Is IPL becoming a choking competition?,3
Woaaaahhh,1
"How did Deep Dasgupta get a commentator spot over more recognized names? Not saying he's bad, he's decent, but how did he even get selected?",1
Boundary on last ball as well plz. No idea what Rashid can do,-2
omgggg,2
Buttler has been coaching young Parag well I see.,3
Malnourished Jason Mamoa giving away runs,10
is this allowed? is this legal? who permitted this?,3
Woah woah,2
Booting **Intent**‚Ñ¢Ô∏è,8
What is Thala in Assamese?,6
Lord Tewatia graciously allowing his side kick Riyan Parag to score runs,10
Parag needs to do SRH bowlers a favor and get out.,4
Also Sandeep Sharma isn't a death over bowler.,3
That scoop I dare anyone to even think against Jofra,3
Don‚Äôt lose this you twats,6
choke.exe got executed,9
RR winning will open the tournament up. Rooting for them although it's hard to watch SRH lose,8
If they pull this off I owe an apology to Parag.,2
"Bowling out Rashid gonna bite them in the arse now

edit: Fuck me he still has one",2
Sandeep is great with the new ball but so bad at the death man,5
That's the difference between Bhuvi and Sandy,10
"With Archer still to come

I put my money on Rr",3
This is why we watch the IPL boys,6
Lads why have masks if you're not even gonna pretend to wear them?,5
these 2 cheap domestic players showing the overpaid overseas players how it's done,5
"No chance they bomb it from here, still got 10 runs too many",0
18 runs you fucking donkey. Last ball is a shit deliveryy opt not to hit it. Smh,5
Sandeep is hot trash. He bowls like Vijay Shankar and can't bat. Just bring in Thampi. Can't be any worse than this.,5
RASHID PLS,6
Once again.... Yuvraj.exe loading in lord,6
just start cunting. archer‚Äôs next y‚Äôall got nothing to lose,4
Tewatia will smash the fuck outta Rashid for sure,2
RR can actually afford to take 6 from Rashid's over and still be in a fighting position here.,6
Man I swear if they pull off a KXIP here,3
oh fuck no,2
"If they can milk 8 runs off the Rashid's over, it's their game.",2
Sandeep Sharma no line and no length. Just stick him for the first couple of overs. He is junior Praveen kumar.,5
"Anything less than 24 for Khaleel to defend, we lose this.",7
RK over!!!,0
Warne is Disgusted,2
Wicket please,2
You know they are going for the big shots. Why not bring in Rashid?,1
Riyan Parag looks like Gary Kasparov l,2
Rashid Natarajan Khaleel the next 3 overs please,2
Rashid Khan has an over left. SRH can't lose this till Rashid Khan is here.,2
Tewatia Vs Rashid.,4
Riyan parag and Priyam garg - face off,4
RR would even be happy with two or three runs in this over,2
tewatia vs rashid >>>> batman vs superman,6
Tewatia & Jofra can do it,5
No wicket in this over would be good for RR regardless of runs.,1
Ummm. Did Rashid just get hit,4
RR need to safely negotiate Rashid khan's over. 8 runs without wicket would be enough.,1
Lord tewatia vs Rashid,4
Tewatia can fuck with Rashid too.,6
Lord wow,2
Fucking full toss.,3
The Lord has actually arrived,5
"Murali always looks like he's sitting at the edge of the seat, and wants to get on the field and bowl.",5
Ffs we loosing it,3
Lord tewatia>rashid,6
Bruh just need to take singles of this over now,3
The Lord respects no one,8
TEWATIA YOU MAD MAN,5
Lord tewatia showing how its done.....,9
The Lord has different plans for Rashid.,4
He scored 4 of rashids over??,2
Lol....is srh seriously going to lose here!,4
I like how RR are fighting here after such a poor start,2
When Lord strikes nobody is safe!!,3
"I had to confirm with my parents if that was a four, I thought I was hallucinating",4
Rashid finally meets his match,4
Only Tewatia has the balls to hit Rashid like that. Just wow,6
I feel Rashid might be easier to hit than Natarajan,2
"This game now rests in the hands of Rashid Khan, which is good news if you're SRH fan",4
I feel 2 more sixes in this over. Rashid chokes in such situations and this is Lord Tewatia,3
BRIAN CHARLES TEWATIA,4
are we seriously about to bottle this,3
Match on,1
One boundary and rest singles and doubles from rashid over doesn‚Äôt seem too much. 26 from 2 is chaseable,1
"LORD TEWATIA IS ASCENDED  


THIS ISN'T CRICKET, THIS IS SOMETHING MORE, THIS IS TEWATIABALL",6
Tewatia fucking with KP lol,6

Now i am gonna support RR just because of lord tevatia,3
LORD TEWATIA,1
Bro you've got all your fielders in the ring on the off side and you're giving him width?,1
Idiots. Rashid is not a 18th over guys. He is a fricken 16-17th over guy maximum!,2
We got a new mr.360 in the house.,5
Face the lord's wrath y'all!!!!,3

RRs batting starts after 5 wickets only,1

The Lord willed the bails to stay.,9
"Lol, luck favors the brave.",5
Man what the hell,4
I think Tewatia might be my favourite player in the world!,6
"Bails didn't come off but lit up

Yikes that's just bad luck",8
"When the Lord bats, the bails come to life",14

Zing bails nonsense..flashbacks to the 2019 WC,13
This guy has bails.,5

It is SRH‚Äôs turn to get Tewatia‚Äôed,5
We need another Tewatia apology thread!,5
Another miracle by the Lord,4
Oof,1
"Hahaha, of course **this** would also happen.",4
Tewatia is actually a big dick lord lol,2
What luck!,4
Holy moly this is drama,2
Nattu boy,2
"We lose this, Khaleel is gonna leak 15 runs",3
Rahul 'INTENT' Tewatia!!,6
"SRH: All right it's Rashid! This over over would kill the game for RR surely

Lord Tewatia: Aight, it's time to use 10% of my power",9
You joke but Tewatia is actually GOD!!!,4
The bails got scared of the lord,5
Rashid come's on                                                                                 Tewatia- So anyway's I started belting,4

[deleted],3
Riyan Parag played similar kind of inning against us last season. Singlehandedly won RR the match. And we couldn't qualify for playoffs.,4
We need a good Nattu over,4
the bails was a paid actir,6
Tevatia with his thala mode plus lady luck,2
Why wasn't that out? Did the bails not fall?,4
"When it's lord, nothing can go your way sorry",8
He is no Lord  He is God,4
"it is happening, folks!",1
"Everyone: Just play out Rashid Khan

Tewatia: I am gonna try to win in Rashid‚Äôs over only",13
"Some people said tewatia was a one night show. 

Well where r they now?",9
Khaleel will leak 15,2
Lmao lord tewatia shitting on people from r/cricket who said he is a one time thing,14
Bails of steel,7
"""Bowling leg spinner to left hander is a bad idea""",15
Tewatia works in mysterious ways,11
Rahul Rajasthan Tewatia Royals,1
Tewatia is the golden boy,6
Tewatia cunting Rashid. Now I've seen it all.,5
Come on nattu,3
SRH channelling their internal KXIP,6
Tewatia is unironically RRs best batsman this year,14
Tewatia jokes will soon reach Zlatan levels.,10
The Lord chooses his moments,12
Good. Don't fuck up now RR.,3
Chutya bring a bowler like Bumrah!,3
I don't have trust in Khaleel. This game is gone Bois. Sorry for not reverse jinxing earlier,11
HAIL THE LORD,15
Tewatia is Rajnikanth,12
Legends would say that the bails are bought,13
Tewatia don't give a fuck if you are T20 specialist.,16
Even the balls obey the lord,12
"I mean the Lord is smashing a belligerent Rashid Khan, the bails dare fall on him",13
Ugh,3
DC batting first was the last thing I wanted. Shit!,5
Tewatia the Lord!,11
"I would be interested to see Rashid Khan's record against left handed batsmen.

It seems his major advantage is pitching the bow outside off stump, and get it to spin further outside - this won't really work for a left handed batsmen",5
"LOL, there was an idiot here who said Tewatia can only hit slow long hops :-)",7
Bail was scared to fall in front of the lord,5
lmao KXIP would bottle this even if they had 4 overs,7
Nattu needs to give just 6 runs this over.,6
Tewatia already seems to be the best Indian finisher since Dhoni's golden days.,15
"Let RR win this, tewatia and Riyan deserve this",7
It all comes down to our lord and saviour Khaleel now. Lord vs Lord.,5
"Tewatia's strike was shown again and again to be weak against spinners, so he decided to target the best of them to increase it. Lord indeed.",9
Even the bails afraid to go against Tewatia XD,2
SRH fucked it up.,3
[I guess we have an answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/j91jbf/match_thread_26th_match_sunrisers_hyderabad_v/g8hbnvh?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3),2

I just want RR to win because of Tewatia,7
Games not over yet. Khaleel is on fire.,4
Lmao Pant dropped for Rahane,13
KX can feel your pain SRH,2
"Fucking poor fielding man, and then how many years will you need to know that sandeep is shit in final overs",2
Don‚Äôt get to say this often so let me savor this. Proud of my fellow Faridabadi Lord Tewatia. No longer just the land of Sonu Nigam haha,7
"""*O ye of little faith*"" ‚Äì Lord Tewatia to the plebs of r/Cricket",7
People keep calling Tewatia one hit wonder and he keeps delivering,10
Instead of sandeep they should have just bowled out 3D,6
"Hell, yes. Aggression without cheating - everything Ponting wished to be but could never emulate to the same level.

Telling the world to fuck off and FOLLOWING it up with fuckoffesque performances - that's some alpha shit right there. Takes balls because if you fall flat, you become Krunal Pandya (lmao). Tewatia has revitalised bragging about big dicks and then actually having a 13-incher - and that's a good recipe for fun times (no homo... I think?)

He's a spicee boii, is that Lord Tewatia",18
"Of all the players that I have underestimated, I guess I have underestimated Tewatia the most, at least compared to what he has been dishing out with bat and ball.",4
That was actually a good shot,1
That scoop is scary.,2
Y'all still think that innings was a fluke?,2
Wicket coming up,2
"This has just been bad bowling and fielding from SRH tbh

RR showed that slower balls back of a length were virtually impossible to get away but SRH have bowled in the slot at pace",6
Smith butler stokes and every time fucking tewathia has to win them games.,11
everyone shut up we haven‚Äôt won this yet,10
Nattu needs to nail the yorkers here,1
Bravo and bumrah same number of Yorkers???,1
How much can khaleel defend in the last?,6
This is where no Bhuvi hurts,5
"""Rahane comes in for pant """,6
Archer still to come,3
Tempted to support RR solely for Tewaita at this point.,7
It wasn't Sharjah; it was Tewatia all along.,9
The Lord is in the fucking mood. And Archer in the dugout. Even Parag is hitting. 180 degree turn.,8
RR is shit. They never had a strong team. Never ever. They sneak into the top 4 every once in a while but they never had a 'complete team'. They don't even have a proper fan base. Most Rajasthanis support other teams. Their team is always a 'B' team and same goes with their management. Their fan base is so shit that they were trying to get fans from Assam by having Riyan Parag in their team and hosting some of their home games in Assam. RR seriously needs to do a DC now. End of rant.,6
Easy win if we need 12 off 2 balls and Archer is on strike,2
"All those who said Tewatia was a one hit wonder

Aao papa ko hello bolo",11
archer already in fear.,8
"Lol, I remember how fans here were saying teams should play off Rashids overs (in other match)",1

"SRH can still win this, Natarajan is the key.",1
Natraj is exceptional,1
When r/cricket gives you the title *Lord* unironically,15
Tewatia works in mysterious ways. Never stop believing.,6
Well done with the over rate.,2
I have a bad feeling about this game,8
"Natarajan - he's got a cool head, hasn't he?",6
Bumrah not in yorker list,1
LORD TEWATIA: im about to end this teams winning efforts,1
"Come on SRH win this. After the shit RR pulled off with us, they deserve every loss they can get",5
All on khaleel. It's getting scary out there,7
Im going gay for tewatia,19
Uh-oh!,7

Wtf happened? We were Winning it easily,4
"Damn wtf Tewatia is really good, not just a meme",13
Shot tewatia - RR mangement,9
The Lord hitting inside out cover drives off yorkers.,10
This is peak IPL. An uncapped Indian bowler vs two uncapped Indian batsmen. Phew!,15
When Lord hits... Everyone just watch....,12

Tewatia ensuring he'll get a handsome paycheck in the next auction (next year?). Good for him.,15

"94/5 in 15 overs with the RRR 13 (65 runs in 30 balls)

Fielders going in all directions,6
Tewatia plays reverse sweep when going away and does swing through if in the arc.,6
This has been a better innings by Tewatia than his onslaught against Punjab. Tougher pitch & bigger outfield. Showed his range of shots too.,37
Oh 3D Player.....,3
Tewatia and left handed bowlers no better story üòç,6
Parag has done exactly what made him known last year. Bailing out RR from difficult positions. Don't know why he was dropped for Lomror.,19
Perfect 3rd Dimension,7
Vijay Shankar showing his 3D skills.,10
3D fielding,7
"Come on, an intl cricketer can't fumble like that!",6
"All this planning, just for Khaleel to bowl it in the slot",9

3 from 3 ...hard to lose from here.. except If you are KXIP,16
[deleted],9
This has all the vibes of Neeraj Patel and Ravindrasinh Jadeja from 2008 against MI. Those who watched that game know What I'm talking about.,10
Why am I rooting for RR all of a sudden? I hate the team!!,15
one wicket to shake things up,13
"Somebody here legit compared English players in RR with colonial era free loader Englishmen, can somebody help me find that comment??",12
Tewatia at the end should just a take a mic and announce to SRH dugout *consider yourself Tewatiad*,14
Lol Khaleel tapping tewatia,6
"Are the scriptwriters back? 
/s ofcourse.",5
"Catch drops, bails won't come off. These are not coincidences, this is just a work of divine intervention by Lord Tewatia",12
Sensible play,3
Tewathia>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> krunal pandya.,16
RR gave SRH the template for bowling on this pitch at the end and they've done the opposite lmfao,5
2D shankar,6
"If it's super over:

RR: Tewatia and Butler
SRH: Warner and Pandey",4
The game changed when Tewatia decided to not play out Rashid and instead hit him for three back to back 4s.,9
Let's not forget Riyan Parag's contribution guys. More or less equally good,5
Super over bitches,1
So if this goes to a super-over I assume that Tewatia will bat and bowl?,9
It all went wrong with our batting. Our bowlers had to have a bad day.,5
The R in Mahendra Singh Dhoni stands for Rahul Tewatia,19
I feel a wicket here,2
Dhoni wishes he was Tewatia,12
It'll take some punjab level shit to lose from here,3
Only a wonder like the Pandhya with Ban can make SRH win this,4
In b4 Khaleel mankads Tewatia.,12
"Khaleel - once a cunt, always a cunt.",6
Khaleel is a massive bitch,7
Imagine if you were Tewetia's family and friends in his village. Such joyful moments!! ü•∞,38
Don‚Äôt mess with Tewatia man,11
Should have brought Khaleel in the 19th over,8
Khaleel playing 4D chess,2
this is a big middle-finger to all the armchair experts who said that Tewatia is a one-hit wonder.,14
"Khaleel playing mind games, learning from the master",7
Looks like a loss bois,15

Tewatia 50 and I strip for r/india,9
I‚Äôm not worthy to exist on the same planet as Tewatia,26
Fuck me..we're losing fair play points aren't we,16
What happened between khaleel and lord,8
Looks like khaleesi's beard trimmer slipped,7
They had less than 10% chance to win Tewatia is really a god,24

This is youngsters IPL!!,10

Lost the match at Manish Pandey 50,9
What a slap to end it,6
"SRH bottlejob

Had the game in the bag and fucked it

Top innings from Parag and Tewatia but they've been helped by some awful bowling",13
Yes finally a win,1
Can't even be mad jai tewatia,5
Snake dance next time?,5
What a fucking game,11
This is a beautiful win for the Royals. Especially as even their fans never expected it.,12
"So after all that chat, The leadership group decided it was best to bowl a wide full toss.",35
Let's fucking gooooooooo.,3
Looks like Warner is the fucking sook today.,2
TEWATHIA BOLTEEEEEE,3
What's Warner whinging about?,8
Khaleel with full toss üòÇüòÇ,13
Any mods on this thread....a Tewetia flair anytime?,23

That's how it is done CSK!,8
"I legit hate my life, can't catch a break with a single team I support lol",6

If cricket is a religion then tewatia is the god,11
LORD! LORD! BEHOLD THY LORD!!!,5
"Lol .. literally ""Nachoo behenchod"" celebration. What a comeback.",14
2 of 2 needed and he bowls a full toss. Classic khaleel ahmed,8
"This is a wholesome win, thanks to riyan and tewatia",6
Warner is complaining?,7
YESSSSSSS,4
"Riyan Parag, nerves of steel. Hats off!!",12
"Warner is a twat, pass it on",3
Lmao what was that dance,10
Lol warner is really pissed. üòÇ,4
Khaleel fucks it up in style.,10
Tewatia not a happy man lmao,11
What is Warner arguing about.,11
Tewatia blessed us with another Classic,7
WHAT WAS THAT BOWLING?,6
Sore lowers haha get fucked Warner,3
"RR should just play 11 Indians, they‚Äôll do better. The foreign players have been pedestrian",13
Tewatia is God.,7
Make a gif out of that dance,8
I heard Tewatia gives Russell finishing tips,3
Tewatia: The next IPL bid war goes burr‚Çπ‚Çπ‚Çπ,13
Such a confidence booster for RR definitely! After a series of defeats and 3 of their BIG4 failed today.. Yet an amazing victory.. Certainly not a ONE MATCH WONDER guy!!!!!,13
That was one real fuck up by SRH,10
Holy shit! Lord does it again,8
"53 (31) against King XI Punjab, recovering from one of the worst starts ever - wins the game.

45* (28) against Sunrisers Hyderabad, walking in at 78-5 with the RRR above 10rpo.

RR should retain Lord Tewatia instead Smith for next season",31
[deleted],16
Warner: I have the monopoly on grit. Get off my lawn,9
Switch Uthappa and Stokes in today's batting order and RR is set.,6
"Congrats Royals, well deserved win. What a finish from the boy",1
Srh angered the lord so they had to lose,7
Mortals arguing with Lord.... Ticket to Hell confirmed for Warner...,14
Fuck this team. Especially **FUCK SANDEEP**,11
"RR only wins when Lord Tewatia gets runs

FACT",30
"Next match

Rr shud open with Buttler n Tewatia",13
"Shut the fuck up Khaleel, you dont sledge the lord",28
RIP fair play points,14
What did Tewatia say to Khaleel???,12
"lol Warner is such a salty bitch

Bend the knee dickhead",13
Imagine provoking Lord Tewatia. SRH ain't making it to the playoffs,19
Thanks RR,8
Lets not forget parag contribution here just as much important as tewatia knock,9
KXIP is our only friend now,6
Tewatiya is pissed. Kya kiya Khaleel ne?,16
This will do wonders to RR. Wonders. Huge boost. But Smith needs to get his head right,4
Khaleel not shaking his hand.,14
Nice moves from Ryan Reynolds,9
Thanks to Sandeep & Manish RR Won,6
Parag's temperament is miles ahead of other u-21 players. He is sure shot a future regular for India ahead of anyone.,21
Tewatia was definitely good. He played off Yorkers man. Khaleel is shit.,16
Don't sleep on Parag too- a mature innings and repaid the faith of selectors after fickle fans were baying for him,25
HELL YES!!,11
Talks shit then bowls a full toss thats whacked into the second tier. In tears.,63
Don't fuck with god khaleel.,20
Tewatia let it go man. You guys won. Looks like SRH is trying to calm him down,12
Warner and Pandey strike rate masterclass allowed Tewatia do his magic again.,6
SRH mourning thread coming up ?,5
@kings this is how you chase.,7
"You little fucker you pull this shit off and you FortNite dance on SRH?

Well i guess you get to do that. Amazing innings Riyan.",18
Hate the ads now,3
What happened between Tewatia and Khaleel?,26
We fucked it up,11
"Tewatia and riyag , I love you guyss",2
Khaleel is always a bit of a cunt,10
"Riyan is a big time gamer. Fully expected him to do Fortnite dance, lol.",15
"Smith wins the Sandpaper derby.

 Smith 1


Warner 0",37
Muh Devudu Warner. No only one devudu and it is Tewatia,2
Winning of rr is good for rcb,8
This loss showing true colours of Warner and Khaleel. Not even surprised that cunts being cunts.,18
What was the fight about?,6
Yes!!!!,2
waiting for FANS to say that Pandey is the reason for SRH's loss.,8
I am so happy for RR. Fans needed a win badly XD. Get drunk lads,19
"RAHUL, REMEMBER THE NAME!",10
"SRH : Look at me, I‚Äôm the KXIP now.",7
"We were 15 runs short, as every sensible person knew after the first innings. I hope Manish Pandey introspects on his batting.",8
"Both Parag and Lord did great, but have to say Lord's boundaries against Rashid Khan was the clincher",12
Parag: ‚Äúmain bhi hu MC‚Äù,8
Please don't open with Stokes the next game.,10
The sky is blue. Warner is a cunt. More at 11.,9
Khaleel upto no good again,3
I DIDN‚ÄôT GIVE UP ON THESE FUCKS. MAYBE A LIL BIT WITH THE CONSTANT SELF LOATHING BUT I KEPT THE FLAIR UP,9
"HOLY FUCK!!!!! What the fuck happened? 

Fuck Smith

Fuck Butler

Fuck Stokes

Fuck Samson

Take a bow, Tewatia and Parag. 2nd best match in this season after first Tewatia miracle. PHEW!!!",21
"Nicely done but unnecessary shot in the end. Couldve done with a safer approach, we've seen many chases botched that way",6
That was some bottle,4
Sharjah is not a place it's a feeling - Lord Tewatia,21
Tbf RR had a long ass batting lineup with everyone until no.8 who can score sixes and deliver decent innings.,7
Tewatia don't take no shit,5
I wouldn‚Äôt put it past Khaleel to be the cunt here,7
"What was up with the argument between tewatia, khaleel and Warner?",14
"Not saying Tewatia should be straight away selected for the T20i sqaud but he looks like a better bat than Jadeja. So if selecting  Jadeja, better to select Tewatia",17
That was the Bihu dance guys . He is from Assam,16
SRH were winning this game. Then they provoked Lord Tewatia.,17
if Uthappa wears an Alice Band he will score a 50 I guarantee it,3
I think Khaleel was just telling Tewatia that he won't be able to finish the game today.,9
Lol fucking full tosses it,9
What the fuck is khaleel doing LOL,9
Goddamn,2
"Oh fuck off everyone, that was not a Fortnite dance that was traditional Assamese dance Riyan Parag does after every wicket he takes.",43
Parag looks like Aakash Ambani,6
"Finallly! I knew we'd bounce back with the international powerhouse trio of Stokes, Buttler and Smith at the top!",15
"So the key to win against RR is to not take wickets so the Lord doesn't come, okay.",8
[deleted],-8
Without Bhuvi it was really difficult for SRH to win,2
A lot of credit to Parag too he started the onslaught,8
So you can celebrate like an idiot when you take a wicket Warner but if someone hits a game winning 6 they need to not show emotion?,4
Lol calm the fuck down khaleel.,5
can anyone tell me why they fight,5
Without Bhuvi it was really difficult for SRH to win,6
This is where SRH lack Bhuvi. You can‚Äôt trust the other bowlers bar Rashid at the death,10
[deleted],-8
Where my kx11p homies at? Let‚Äôs be sad together,12
"So the key to win against RR is to not take wickets so the Lord doesn't come, okay.",12
Why the fuck can't Warner just accept a defeat with grace?,1
"Not sure why Warner is so salty, let the youngster celebrate",13
Lord tewtia is gaining a cult following.,19
"We have won 3 matches, all not because of out best in business overseas but because of guys who don't even make it to India-A",12
Got Tewatia'd. No regrets with that. GG RR. I am more than happy for SRH for giving good games to watch.,11
"In hindsight, that Parag drop did become costly.",18
This is petential I saw Parag last season. Fucking glad to see him perform and no words to express for one and only Lord Tewatiya.,14
What was Tewatia angry about?,7
IPL 2020 being carried by the young indian players,7
Show the dance....never showed the replay,15
Khaleel must've called Tewatia a big fat fluke.,10
When will they realize that Sandeep Sharma is not a end over bowler. He started it and they closed it with Rashid,7
"**Highest unbeaten 6th wicket stand in winning run chases (IPL)**

122* A Rayudu - K Pollard, MI v RCB 2012 

85* S Smith - J Faulkner, RR v RCB 2014

85* R Parag - R Tewatia, RR v SRH 2020

*Cricbuzz*",18
KL Rahul who? Tewatia is the best Rahul.,11
"Even though I was supporting srh in this match, tewatia's innings was an absolute delight to watch. Usually in comebacks like these, it's down to one team choking horribly, but I don't think you could really say that about this one.",26
bEsT BowLinG SidE iN ThE TOuRnAmEnT.,10
IPL would have been so much more competitive and interesting if only the team with the lower rank won every match.,6
RR showing CSK how it's done,3
Did I just see Davey step in to diffuse a situation and not incite one? 2020 really is wild,28
The last over of Sandeep made all the difference. They lost it from there,7
"Warner got salty after his dance.

Dude let him enjoy he is a youngster, this inning could change his life.",28
"There is a reason Tewatia is called Lord. 
And well, Riyan Parag, you beauty.",20
"Ok, what exactly is an unachievable score these days in the last few overs? 60+ required in 5 overs and it's achieved, and this isn't the first time either. Crazy how the game has evolved.",12
Damn disappointing but god damn Riyan and Tewatia. Riyan replaced somebody today is it,15
Tewatia for #7 in India?,11
Everyone shitting on Khaleel when Sandeep did much worse,20
"Riyan parag
Devdutt padikkal
Tiyagi
Nagarkotti

All of them have done well in this ipl!

Why is jaiswal not performing ?",14
"I hope RR can carry the momentum. Last time they won a tight game, lost four in a row.",13
So nice of him to do the Bihu... Northeast is really under-represented in Indian cricket,48
Om Tewatia Namah!,21
"Everytime Lord plays, he makes sure he gives out motivation with win.",20
INTENT,8
Rashid gave more runs is his last over than his did in his last match,13
What a great contest between bat and bowl this was.,11
Warner got pissed off by Parag....He should have played against Sreesanth,28
Tewetia is the only constant this IPL. What a madlad!,58
"Wow, did not think we would win that after top order collapse!",32
"Rashid gave more runs is his last over than his did in his last match

It‚Äôs cool gg bois, that‚Äôs what we get for underestimating the lord",44
Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs Warner causing anything. Khaleel messed up- the cap‚Äôs gotta do it for his team,27
Royals need to stop putting all overseas batsmen at the top,37
What happened between Tewatia and Khaleel,30
"That was the Bihu dance, the traditional dance of Assam, not Fortnite dance.

My bad.",91
Great win for rr and ipl needed a good chase but Smith hasn't captained well,20
Please don't forget Parag it wasn't just Tewatia!,74
"All memeing aside, what Tewatia's displaying is something unique. Given the off-late lack of good Indian young finishers, he might just be the wildcard India needs.",39
Where is the guy with Rcb flair saying Tewatia is fake lord,21
Lord Tewatia,17
"Get Tewatia in Indian T20, the guy can be what Dhoni used to be.

Great to see Parag playing a mature innings. Would like to see him in Indian team too.",16
"Tewatia, what a legend! I hope he channels his emotions in the right direction and has a great career.",29
Warner has always been a cunt. No surprise there.,16
All hail lord tawatia,23
"BC just when Parag was saying something about the final over plan, it goes off",22
[removed],20
Wtf hotstar ends live stream before presentation ends. Fucking idiots you have a streaming service start the other match on another stream!,33
"‚ÄúMy motto was to take it deep.‚Äù  

Dhoni should sue Parag for using his patented chasing technique.",45
The Lord looks so cute when sulking,15
Lord works in mysterious ways. Greatest T20 bowler? Doesn't matter for our Lord.,23
Can we please have Stokes as a middle order batsman and have an opener who actually opens normally,34
Guys what the hell?????? I assumed  SRH had won this and stopped watching the match. What the hell just happened???,26
Disney+ Hotstar rudely cut off the live steam before we could listen to the Lord.,30
Tewatia could earn himself a place in the India team for the T20 World Cup,26
"Barring the fact that I'm salty cause my team lost, Tewatia played a great knock. He legit played off the pressure.",33
Catches wins you matches as simple as that,11
Drop catch and bails not falling. Sometimes it do be like that,11
That dance was cute.,24
my heart is at peace now.,34
Tewatia is a serious lower order batsman. India needs to consider him for T20Is as we don't have many good hitters lower down the order.,31
At least ricciardo got podium. Something to be happy about even though we lost the match we shouldn‚Äôt have.,16
KP is having a boner with Parag‚Äôs intent,24
Maza aa gaya BC....,7
LORD TEWATIA DOEOS IT AGAIN!!,13
This innings by Parag is the biggest win for the pan masala industry since Pierce Brosnan endorsed Pan Bahaar.,34
Link of that dance?,8
I want Warner do that Parag dance on his Tik Tok/Insta,20
Anyone else having hotstar issues? Both matches not streaming. Live streaming has ended/ will begin shortly. Dafaq hotstar?,12
This seems like a season where we'll finish 5th/6th. I won't mind tbh. An overhaul is needed.,14
Why Tewatia always pissed,17
Reverse jinxing didn‚Äôt work seems like,17
Lord tewatia >>>>>> Jadeja >>>>>>>> Krunal,21
Classic chase. And a lovely Bihu by Parag.,15
Rahul Tewatia is the superstar match-winning all-rounder Rajasthan fans thought Stokes would be.,46
Someone please tell the reason of fued? Did warner said something to tewatia?,7
Ok who's gonna start the church of Tewatia,19
"u/James12Cole we are alive in tournament damnit, and fuck you Khaleel.

Did Warner did something too ?",9
"That dance Parag did at the end there instantly made him a gem to me. I don't even care that he fucked KKR single handedly last season. Hitting a bowler who's just started some shit with your batting partner for 6 on the very next ball to win the game, then flexing on him with that dance. Ultimate alpha move.",66
"I mean if we really want to show respect how about we stop calling guys like Tewatiya 'lord' and all that nonsense. 

It implies there's an element of luck and flukiness. Whereas, Tewatiya has shown throughout the tourney he's a clutch late order finisher and he's done most of it without much support from the top order and the big names. 

Even in a few losing causes, he's scored a decent 20-30 which is pretty decent for anyone. 

He not only has the skills but has great composure which is even more valuable at this level.",32
r/lordtewatia when ?,24
Natarajan needs to somehow work on some other bowl. His Yorkers are basically restrictive but not destructive. Also if he keeps on bowling same line of Yorkers batsmen will figure him out like today and will smash him.,11
Rahul...naam to suna hi hoga.,11
"It‚Äôs never over till it is, huh 64 off 4, with a Rashid over to come. SRH would‚Äôve thought they have this in the pocket",26
"Ipl 2020: 
No matter whichever team is winning the match before 16-20 overs of the 2nd innings no matter how easily they are winning there's a plot twist in the last 4 overs.üòÇ",22
Tewtaia-Khaleel >>>> Yuvi-Flintoff,9
Fortnite kids are now old enough to play in the IPL. Makes me feel ancient.,6
Lord Tewatia and Parag were so impressive damn,18
[deleted],4
Also Lara did say left handed will have easier time wile facing Rashid.,22
Tewatia is a serious talent,26
Arise lord tewatia,18
IF KXIP had someone like Riyan Parag they would be in top 4 right now lol. Unreal temperament at 18.,21
"What I liked most about Tewatia today, was how he took on Rashid and destroyed his over. Will Rashid get effected the same way like Cotterel after this beating?",34
"Khaleel having a conference with Warner and Kanos only to bowl a free ""hit me"" full toss",31
As a neutral this makes me happy as it opens up the table just a tad. Hoping Mumbai loses tho.,13
Parag's dance tewatia argument. Man RR'S fair play point is gonna take a big hit. They are already at the bottom.,18
Miss you Bhuvi,17
"Want to see Narine defending against Tewatia

Unstoppable force vs Immovable object",28
I miss Kanos' captaincy. The attacking mindset he had to finish the match as early as possible made sure that we won't deal with such late flourishes more often than not.,12
Tewatia reverse sweeping twice to Rashid will be one of the epic moments in this IpL,52
"I think the bowling unit did well. RR just held their nerves better. Appreciate for what it is, the other team is also here to perform. It was a good game.",24
I actually thought about changing my flair to DC. But today the lord replied to me with the bat. I should have never doubted him. I have sinned. Oh lord forgive my sinful thoughts.,50
Dhoni who? Finisher who? All hail Lord Tewatia,42
"Rise and Rise Again 

Until Lambs become Lions",21
"Have you realized how Kohli literally never sledges other players. He just shouts at umpires if he doesn‚Äôt get his way, and exchanges words loudly when provoked. That‚Äôs why Australians hate him. They sledge him but it doesn‚Äôt work. Warner was shit-things not going his way so he sledges Tewatia",19
Lord>>>Dhoni,18
"Butler

Samson

Smith

Parag

Stokes

Tevatia

Archer

This is no doubt one of the best batting line up in this year don't@ at me",21
"I had faith in Tewatia, that he would live up to his name of the Lord. He‚Äôs not just a one-match wonder, and I‚Äôm here for it",31
Lord blessed us with 4th position,13
"As a humble devotee, I created this r/LordTweatia to discuss his greatness. Please feel free to join",4
Not sure about others but Tewatia has secured his position in RR for next year's auction.,22
I‚Äôll take solace that nadal beat djokobitch 6-0 and lick my wounds till Tuesday,16
"That time of IPL is here, where you support the teams which will help your favorite team in points table.

From KKR's perspective, happy that Rajasthan won today. Had SRH won tonight, then they would have displaced KKR for number 3 position.",23
RR WON ONE,10
SHR winning most of the match awards but losing the actual match,26
Take a moment to recognise all the foreign and gun batsmen were out before the fifth over and within 25 runs,20
"Tewatia and Archer inducted into the VK, ABD, Faf Hospital for Orthopedic Surgery for broken backs for carrying their teams through the IPL",46
Double digit Samson wins the game for RR again!,22
"Somebody tell me why did parag danced like that?
Who sledged tewatia?",4
I still can't believe this loss. I need a smoke,11
David Warner finally dropped his pr positive attitude in the end,6
well khaleel actually apologies for what ever he had done,12
"Maybe it‚Äôs just me, but if I am on the winning side of it, I would be the one deescalating. 

Continuing to talk shit after you are up, honestly shows a lack of character.",-8
"KKR and RCB, and probably CSK: thanks RR",14
Can we talk about Sanju Samson? My guy had two strong games and has been a disappointment for the next 5 games.,22
[deleted],31
So Tewatia has been responsible for two out of three wins for RR,36
Lord Tewatia > Dhoni / Maxwell / Russell / other naam bade darshan chote finishers this season.,26
"Good opportunity for rahane to anchor the innings, he normally opens so the early wicket won‚Äôt matter much to him.",4
"You either die a hero or you live long enough to become the villain. 

Khaleel bowling a juicy full toss after wrecking RR's top order.",17
 [A fiddle on the lord](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/j95vds/-/g8hl0ld),3
I think they hired David Fincher for scriptwriting this season.,16
"Why are people calling Warner out for sledging! Are we watching a different match? It was clearly an argument between Khaleel and Tewatia. Warner being the skipper just was trying to clear things out on behalf of his teammate. Tewatia was constantly pointing at Khaleel when Warner was having a conversation with him, so it's a clear proof that Tewatia was explaining the issue to him. Stop taking him for an easy target for his troubled past.",33
Anybody know why Warner got so angry in the end there?,9
I need to know what Khaleel said to Tewatia and why Warner was mad about it,12
"Well, now we need 4 wins from 7 games, it‚Äôs gonna be a REALLY difficult task to mate it to the Playoffs",20
"Lol there was a little rift between Khaleel n Tewatia in the last over

Warner being the bigger name was just tryna cool things down between the two

Why tf r ppl framing Warner here?? Lmao this is what happens when lord strikes. Intellects go mad.",37
Would like to see Tewatia as a finisher for India one day,25
"Sandeep shouldn't have a place in this team at all. He is way past his prime and so easy to hit. The line, length and pace.. Everything about him is predictable. I was predicting his deliveries form my couch with precision every single time. I can't understand why have they boycotted Thampi altogether. He getting the treatment Nattu got for 2 seasons. That man is leap and bound ahead of Sandeep(right now) in terms of bowling if you've seen him bowl in domestic circuits. One or two wrong team selection is seriously hurting us.",10
Can someone upload a video of the sledge? I missed it,22
"So what was really the matter between Warner, Khaleel, and Tewatia?",13
"I think it‚Äôs fair to say Punjab, CSK, Sunrisers (big ask without Bhuvi and still not sorted their best 11) aren‚Äôt making it. Benefit of doubt to Royals because they just need to click",10
The Lord giveth and giveth,13
"15 runs short, all Pandey's fault imo 
But seriously they were 15 short and tewatia pulled another rabbit out of his hat. SRH had this game if they could have closed it better, miss bhuvi here.",15
Warner was angry at the end bcoz Riyan Parag stole his tik tok moves,28
"And khaleak is a bum in these situations 
Better off giving kaul or thampi the spot",11
RR making me believe in them again and raising my hopes,16
Legend has it that Tewatia still wants a pat on the back from Ponting  for those 4 catches :P,36
"SRH Guys, now you know how KXIP guys feel!",22
"It's a pity that Lord Tewatia is stuck in a team of ordinary players like Stokes, Buttler and Smith",81
"In case anyone misses this, this is another match where Pandey stayed for 35+ deliveries and we lost it. It's just not a funny coincidence anymore. It's a serious Stat which emphasises how poorly he builds his innings and how adverse the impact his innings has on the final outcome. I've been an outright Pandey Critic from day one and not the fickle kind that writes ""r/cricket, talk nah"" everytime he hits a Non consequential boundary.",26
Respects to that somebody who said he switched loyalties to SRH at around 12 overs into the chase,23
uthappa is the lucky charm,15
Fucking Ashish.,6
Fuck off Byjus. Khan academy for life,41
PROUD of the boys,11
