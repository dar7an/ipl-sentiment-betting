The Royals fan in me wants Yashasvi and Manan to play. But the masochist in me is ready for Uthappa to have another 9(20) masterclass...,10
Ohh Mumbai....Oh meri pyaari Mumbai,7

Time for Yashasvi to get a longer rope.,8
Play Jaiswal you cowards,9
Off topic : is rajasthan royals a north indian team or west Indian team? I am confused,5
I hope Rohit eats extra vada pavs today and feeds some to Lord Kock as well. Hope to see a solid opening partnership for once.,9
"If they play jaiswal,I will stop wanking",5
The last we won against RR Pant hasn't made his IPL debut and we had won just one IPL title.,33
Is stokes playing today?,2
"I said it in the very first game and I'll say it again. I don't even care if we win or lose or don't qualify or anything. I mentally checked out for this season the moment Shordul Thiccur was trapped like a noob by Madam Mahalingam last ball of the final last year.

I'm just here for shits and giggles and dinda academy jokes and I love it down here in the cesspool with you all.",5
tare is the cheat code against rr after that six.,13
please no uthappa-unadkat combo today,9
MI would be favourites against anyone but RR is the one team which have had their number so this game should be close. And Buttler is due to fire and has a good record against MI.,7
"Not expecting any changes from Mumbai unless some1 is injured.

RR has to drop Robbie for Jaiswal. They have a weak middle order. Jaiswal opens, Smith goes back to no. 4

Big test for Samson. He has to show some consistency.

Also not sure why unadkat is preferred over Rajpoot. I mean, Tyagi is also there. Better to give a youngster a run than playing Unadkat.",10
"I'm a mi supporter, I hope lord tewatia has mercy on us and let us win",18
I want dravid or warne to be our coach. McDonald seems shit,6
"I've been calculating how CSK can get to the playoffs and how many matches a particular team has to win and how many matches they have to lose and what NRR everyone has to have.

"
Mumbai ready to choke against rr again(Hopefully not)",11
Let's whoop some ass y'all!!!,5
Tom Curran has the worst economy rate (11.53) among all bowlers in IPL history (20+ overs),3
"That incredible game in 2014 where we chased 195 in 14.4 overs was the second last time Mumbai won against Rajasthan. 

It's a sequence of four consecutive losses going on right now. 

Also, it feels like no matter what the format, Steve Smith is going to emerge and do well against whatever team I support. Bounce him Bumrah.",2
"Someone explain me, why didn't rr appoint warne as the head coach?",1
"5, 9, 2, 17

How much more Uthappa has to underperform to give a fair chance to Yashaswi Jaiswal to prove himself?",12
Is stokes playing?,7

"Just checked the stats, LORD TEWATIA has scored 11 sixes this IPL and just 1 four!",57
RR line-up not looking too bad rn.. still don‚Äôt give me hope please,7
Yay smudge I love you so much for the changes today.,3
listening sanju manju on cricinfo and trust me he hasn't changed. Not a single bit. Mumbai pro and mentions RR is the luckiest team and only luck can win them matches.,16
"Been a while but finally watching a RR match, first IPL im watching and supporting them because archer/stokesy/jos/cricketgod so looking forward to it",8
"I think every team needs one bowler who can provide raw pace. They need not be a hyper accurate master of variations like Archer. But someone like Nortje didn‚Äôt have the most stellar record before the IPL yet is still doing well because many batsmen are simply not used to his pace. 
 
SRH bowled 8 overs of harmless military medium bowling at MI and got rightfully punished for it. We need to bring Stanlake in for pace.",12
"Hope Smithy doesn't bat like a spud today.

Rohit Sharma will hit fifty cuz it's the even match....even bumrah won't get smacked oh yeahhhhhh,5
Thumps up for Mi for the changes!,6
What happened to Stokes? Is he resting before he get into the groove?,2
"Karthik tyagi is playing? Man he was so fun to watch in south africa, looking forward to seeing him bowl today",4
What is with choosing to bat and winning? any TA?,2
Who was that presenter dancing around?,2
"Unadkat was a big buy right , still they dropped him ...good selection for RR today and tewatia batting at 5.

Smith can drop down to 4 and hold the middle order today and let Jaiswal bat as opener today",3
"Why is Curran an automatic pick for RR, not economical, not picking wickets, not needed with the bat",6
How many days for stokes to be in quarantine?,1
Where is Virat's fav BEN STOKES,1
"Good changes from RR, dropping Uthappa and Unadkat. Their batting looks a bit thinner today but once Stokes comes in for Curran, that will also change.",5

Rajasthan have won the award for the most mediocre seamers,3
I'm 99% sure paying so much money for Unadkat involves money laundering,5

I don't understand why you won't let your best (and fastest) bowler bowl the first over when both batsmen are vulnerable,5

One of those games where mi gets 100+ opening stand,3
bring out archer ffs,5
Who caught that?,5
Today it's brohit!!!!,7
Typical Rohit six. Glorious,4
Majestic,3
Rohit makes those shots look so effortless,2
Ankit Rajpoot's action is similar to Cummins,1
"""Defense is the best form of offense"" - RR balling Rajpoot instead of Archer to save him for later",3

Fuck Rohit is nice to watch.,2

"Rajpoot: Look at me...LOOK AT ME!!!


I'M the unadkat now",8
"Archer got Rohit out twice in 4 balls, well lets bowl Ankit Rajput with the new ball",9
Brohit makes hitting sixes look so effortless!,10
Rohit Sharma has to be the ballet dancer among batsmen.,8
What timing mann! fucking accurate than a swiss watch.,3
Visibly shouted wow when I saw his bat just swing so beautifully. Amazing.,5
Rajpoot is like the most generic right arm bowler.,6
Is it me or does Rohit Sharma look like Brohit?,8
It doesn't count as a six if comms don't call it an unacademy six. Third umpire automatically checks it every time and feeds back direct to the on field umpires,15

tbh Varun aron is better than Unadkat and Rajpoot,10
I need more of that music in my life,2
It was 4 but why would you play risky shot in PP. I'd understand after PP. @QDK,7
Thought Smith was gonna bowl then for a second,6
Unadkat possessing Rajpoot,3
I thought Smith was about to bowl himself there,5
"Regardless of how he performs today, I cant believe some people actually suggested replacing de Kock with fucking Lynn",37
Unconventional captaincy tip - bowl your best bowler throughout  the power play to reduce the oppositions Run rate whilst the fielders are up,30
Mumbai‚Äôs batting team is unfair to other teams,4
RR fans must be missing Unadkat right now. Turntables,12

2. The requirement for credit cards in India is basically non-existent given how most Indian cards already work everywhere (as opposed to many European debit cards which are useless online because they don't have a card number or CVV), so the volume demand isn't there either.   
 
3. Somehow the app rewards you for doing something you could do without them for free and no additional effort, or even lesser effort if you include downloading and registering for this...    

4. They have enough money to not only sponsor the IPL but also have extensive campaigns interrupting the innings.  

Am I missing something here? This looks like a very expensive marketing exercise propped up by weird VC money with a promise of future profitability and nothing else. India isn't exactly the greatest market for app-banking services like Curve or N26 either, so that can't be the avenue they could take.",13
RR with their current batting form can really use a sub-190 chase today,3
How awesome. Imagine getting your debut cap by Steve Smith!,9
Curran Literally has an economy of 11.7 after 10 IPL matches. Might as well play an Indian youngster ahead of him.,12
where the hell was he all this time,2
wow they're actually cutting their own hair,3
The teams that are succeeding have youngsters/newcomers at 3-4 batsmen and international power hitters at 5-6. Which is why RCB and Punjab are weaker,4

"Can de Kock stop getting out so early, he‚Äôs half the reason I tune into Mumbai‚Äôs matches",9

Might be a good thing to keep daddy Pollard from coming out,2
Haha Sky nice sixüëèüèΩüëèüèΩüëåüèΩ,0
How many times are you going to get out to outside off bouncers to learn better?,1
Thanks u/Motabhai_official but would have preferred Pollard here,2
Dropped catches are pretty entertaining ngl,3
Catching has been absolutely shit in this IPL,5
Curran making it easier for Ben Stokes.,4
[removed],2
wow what a way to get fucked,2
"Playing the devil's advocate here, maybe MI is trying to give other batsmen time to get into form just in case Pollard fails in one of the crucial matches and no one is in form. Considering we haven't reached the late stages of IPL we can afford this and our bowling unit has been performing well as well comparitively",8
Marvelous pull back. MI were well on their way to set up a nigh unassailable total for RR,3
"why doesnt sky ever hit sixes

edit: nvm",5
why is Tom Hanks sitting in RR dugout?,5
Ben i miss you,5
~~Rohit~~ Surya just sweeped him for a six,8
SKY is too lazy to hit down the ground today,5
How wise is to make you bowler bowl 3 over spell in the heat? Rajpoot to bowl last?,2
Sky sweeped the fuck out of that ball,12
"EA 2005 shot, sweeping the fast bowler",32
This man is not having a good tournament,4
What a shot,2
"When Stokes is ready to play matches
Tom Curran can just fuck right off to his home",2
Excellent yorkers. Full tosses in between.,6
Looks like MI are dry running a scenario without Pollard today. Not sure,7
Sending krunal instead of Pollard cost them at least 30 runs,3
Lol I can‚Äôt evenüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ,3
Poor Curran :(,4
Can someone pull out stats of how many catches were dropped in previous IPL upto today's number of matches.,2
This is the last time I pick pollard in my fantasy team. MI are definitely not going to send him in early,1
Damnn nice sky,2
Suryakumar Yadav has turned up today. Absolutely loving how he's hitting it today.,1
Did they make the boundaries small?,2
Need to bring back Manjrekar to counter bhogles gushing,2
Time to enroll Curran into Dinda Academy üòû,3
Suryakumar God,2
SKY just shredding Tom's already low confidence,6
"Surya is hacking the bowlers mind.

He always seem to know what they are gonna bowl and is ready with a shot.",5

SKY you beauty!!!!,3
Can SKY get to 100 here,1

"Rohit in the dressing room - Pandya you are next. Go.

Out walks Krunal instead of Hardik.",3
SKY you beautyüòç Amazing batsman.,1
Sweeping a quick bowler always makes me think of Mal Loye. What a player he was,2
Curran has IPL economy of 11.5. Why does he even bowl at the death,2
Wtf lmao,3
Calm down guys! Ben stokes is over rated in T20s,5
Krunal Pandya's batting at SR of 70 on a pitch where everyone who faced more than one ball batted with SR of more than 150.,4
"Do we get both our games against RR once stokes joins?

We will still beat them but letting you folks you know you have it easy.",4
Bappi Da back in action,3
Hahaha wtf,3
The fuck is up with beamers this season.?,6
Fuck that's murderous,6
I remember the 2010 final and MI making the same decision to not send pollard early. They sent bhajji ahead of him and he came in the end and it was too late...same thing today,1
Spicy,2

"At this point, I think Curran has Murdoch's nudes

Worst bowler in the IPL by Economy Rate and continues to get selected",2
Indian Beamer League,20
"I reckon that Curran has probably cost us the game here. Unless we bowl two excellent overs they‚Äôll easily surpass 180 with Pandya, Yadav and Pollard there, and that should be enough to beat Rajastan",2
Saini at it again,6
Saini arrives,3
Curran bowling some trash,1
**BAT KO LAGA**,5

That‚Äôs scary af,5
If I was there I would have PTSD for life,16
Ipl bowlers new death bowling move: kill the batsman,7
Hopefully Archer gets the same Numbers of abuses that Saini got yesterday,-6
Archer should learn something from lord siraj. You don't apologise,8
Tapori deserved it,3
RR trying RCB startegy to try and kill the batsman,22
"Did pandya just asked umpire ""dena behenchod""",11
152km fireball,5
I guess MI management will get orgasm by keeping Pollard on the edge,5
The classic village tactic of beamer then a yorker,5
"Suryakumar is so talented. Has it all. The timing, finesse, strength, and absurd shot-making ability.",8
Oh damn Archer apologized.,7
Navdeep Archer,6
When did they start playing cricket with bars of soap?,6
That was at 152 kmph wtf,9
There must be a prediction tweet by archer for this bounce incident,4
I understand the enthusiasm and aggression of the cricketers but I find pandya bro's aggression a little annoying at times,1
Unnecessary 20 runs given by RR,2
HE bOwLeD It oN puRpOSE,6
"Can we stop with the Pollard instead of Krunal comments already? With Tewatia and Gopal bowling, and 2 wickets falling in 2 balls, there was no way Pollard or Hardik could have come in. Krunal gave the left handed option, and his wicket wouldn't have mattered as much as Hardik or Pollard's would have. The decision was correct, Krunal was supposed to see off the spin, which he did, probably wasted more balls than required",5
What does bat ko laga translate to?,3
Pollard didn't get to bat lol,7
Lmao Archer is playing with Hardik,4
MI already reached 170 all middle overs effort of RR wasted.,4
Black on black attack ... when will it stop,12
Pandya is no Stoinis and nor is Jofra Saini,14
"Jesus jofra, that could kill someone",8
Pandya almost dead,6
Hardik being exposed against quality bowling.,9
Fuck me yesterday it was Siraj and Saini and today it's Archer. I seriously worry that we might see something ugly because of these beamers some day. Bowlers really need to be more careful.,10
"Archer ü§ù Saini

Pandya ü§ù Stoinis",15
RR's fielding has been piss poor in this ipl,8
153.6!!!,8
MI will get to 200 and its almost impossible for RR to chase that unless Jos gets going but he has been in bad form :(,6
Lomror is the only one in RR who looks like he is giving his 100%,4
175-180 should be a good total?,8
"Hahaha Hardik said ""bat ko laga, dena bhenchod...."" ie ""hit the bat, gimme the runs mofo"" :D",8
"That beamer should probably have had him prevented from bowling in the rest of the innings, that was insanely dangerous.

By the rules the umpire does not have to provide a warning.",7

Archer playing to kill now,9
Is Archer tryna murder one of these batsmen??,15
Pandya isn't looking like he did in 2019. Come in for 10 odd balls and smash 25+ runs.,8
What's wrong with Archer.,0
"Oh my, hope Yadav is okay",6
They can't score off Archer at all.,5
Yeah Hardik can‚Äôt play quality bowling.,8

Finally someone mentioned why it's hard to bowl at the death with all the sweat. It's not dew it's sweat.,2
This SuryaKumar bats like I do in a Cricket game where I can‚Äôt figure out the controls. Typically there is more lenience hitting behind the wickets.,3

I mean with some players you just know they will drag to the leg side so bowling off side is a legit great strategy.,2
"Honestly, SKY deserves a look in India‚Äôs white ball middle order ahead of a Manish Pandey or Jadhav.",9
I don't think hardik is able to connect the ball as well as he did previously.... Wanted pollard in his place.,2
Pandya brothers have been a bit shit.,3
I'd rather have SKY on strike. Pandya hasn't quite got it right tonight and SKY is definitely in great touch.,1
Sky should play for India-in my opinion,2
These 17 balls of hardik if played by Pollard he would have been on 40.. Rohit needs to understand who is the better hitter and finisher. You can't play Pollard and not let him bat.. MI may still win but this is a big captaincy error..,4
I think RR is a great example of a bits and pieces team,3
Why does Rohit Sharma always look like he is holding in fart,6
RR bowling has been atrocious. Literally giving the game away on a silver platter,2
Fuccboi totally out of form. He hasn't middled anything today.,5
"45 dot balls, are you serious",4
Free hits imo are usually not that productive,7

Is smith retarded? Put the fine leg back already.,3

Why is this over taking 2 hours to finish,7
SKY just toying with the bowlers now,5
Pandya brothers playing test,7
The pandyas haven't been in good touch today. Really missing pollard out there,6
How the fuck do you bowl to this man?,3
78 runs of 185 have been made by **SKY**.,7
Why are they wasting pollard?,6
Why the fuck is the fine leg still up? I can‚Äôt comprehend this shit,4

"Mumbai No. 1-5 have all hit a 50 (Considering Pollard to be 5 though he didn't come today)

All 4 main bowlers feature in top 8 wicket takers.

No. 5-6-7 have played useful cameos.

Pollard sits with the highest Strike rate this IPL. 

I am incredibly proud of my team balance right now.",12
"Even if you ball to leg umpire, sky is gonna convert it to 4",7
Scoop god has arrived,2
SKY has scored like half his runs with the ramp shot,2
I think these are too many for Rajasthan to get anyway,5
One of the reasons for IPL matches going for 4 hours is how high intensity and so much is riding on single match is. Even India's International T20s concludes much quicker. IPL> IT20 Bileteral Series.,14
"Wide yorkers.

Do you mean full toss.",3
"I'd say holding Pollard back is about as stupid as holding Eoin back, but nah it's not *that* stupid",6

Suryakumar is playing only behind the stumps,1
"C'mon Pandu bro hit a six

Edit: Wish granted",4
"Just a thought, why can't bowlers target straight ball onto the leg stump when you know batsman is way outside the off stump. I know it is easier said than done but they can still try that. Worst case, it will be called a wide",1
This is already a better over than whatever Curran bowled.,5
Fucking finally,3
I expected Smith to be a better captain.,2
NO BALL PLEASE,3
His shot making is insane,5
HOW did that go for six?,5
5th consecutive 190+ score for MI. Surely a record,21
Those chants are cringe af,7
krunal should be promoted to tail ender next match onwards.,1
Imagine if those 17 balls by Krunal were faced by Pollard. Easily 200+,3
Rajpoot is right hand version of Unadcunt..,8
Harsha talks too much for his own good,6
Sky can get a sponsor tattooed on his arm and make good money with all the scoop shots he's playing.,14
"Mumbai ""190"" Indians",26
"Tbh this is the usual way SKY play at death overs

I remember him playing the same crazy shots against MI when he was playing as KKR's finisher",9
wth Rajpoot,4
So SKY just hit an outside-off wide delivery to fine-leg üî•üî•üî•,7
"SKY must be the best Indian T20 player who will never play an international for India. So classy and yet so effective in the shortest format, but has been ignored so far by National selectors and with age no longer on his side, he will be overlooked for younger talents now",48
Mi 190+ without PolLord striking damn I'm impressed.,25
A rare hardik six,9
I was downvoted for saying Rajdoot was a problem.,13
Undhakat is better than rajpoot,-3

No polly no 200,8

Mumbai is the only team which tuk tuks its way to 190,18
Motormouth Bhogle,1
F for our soldiers having polly as captain or vc,19
MI is unfairly OP in their batting department,13
Yadav looks and plays more like a brother to Pandya than krunal,7
if the smith-buttler-samson trio have a flop night...,7
How MI lost against CSK in the first match is beyond me.,10
"Decent score. Butler, smith, Samson depends on how these three perform.",3
"This innings took 1 hour 53 minutes, out of which 5 mins were strategic timeouts",11
Decent score. Buttler please don't hit us today,3
Opinion on Smith the captain?,3
SKY scored 51 runs behind square LOL,8
190 without Pollard damn,8
"We are 190 up Bois! Where are the armchair experts who were crying so badly about not reaching 180+?

This is a good score for us considering this is Abu Dhabi and we are still scoring 190+",11
Sky was the limit for SKY today :) Great batting,4
MI and DC have such good squads wtf. Near perfect teams,15
MI always start as if they will score 300 then they play like they won‚Äôt even cross 150 and then somehow always manage to score above 180.,51
How shitty a bowler you have to be that the captain gives the ball to rajpoot rather than you,9
Are RR still playing Pan Parag?,1
The top team in this IPL are not the one with best batting its the one with best bowling. You can‚Äôt just create your bowling around one bowler,5
How does Curran have an international career + contracts with teams in basically all the big t20 leagues? The guy bowls nothing but pies.,4
42 off 36 by the Pandya brothers.,7
51 came off the final 3 overs. And it wasn't like Pandya was his usual self tonight.,14
MI hit 68 off the last 5 overs and it did not seem like they completely exploded the way they did in the last games.,15
193 is more than enough,7
Forget the Rohit fifty or no-fifty alternate pattern. MI 190 or 200 is the the new alternate pattern,21
Sending Krunal Pandya was massive blunder. Pollard is literally averaging 100 with sr of 200 this season and he didn't get to bat because of him probably costing MI 15-20 runs on average here.,7
Hardik instead of Krunal and Pollard when Hardik came would have done wonders to this innings. Not bad eventually.,8
Maybe MI fans have too high expectations to be sad with 193 on this ground,18
Is it just me or there seems to be some problem with Rohit???,2

All I wanted was to see Rohit Sharma sulking after losing. Why can't RR give me that!,6

Jaiswal ain't T20 player. He should focus on tests,0
"Mumbai Indians are legitimately looking like early contenders for the title this year. 

Looking at the first XI, I don't really see any weak areas; strong batting lineup with no weak links, big hitters, reliable wrist spinner and a decent holding finger spinner, and a pace attack up there with the best in the tournament. Even their bench has Lynn, McClenaghan, Coulter-Nile waiting in the wings.

Not to forget, Rohit is a very good captain and his partnership with Mahela seems in-sync.",8

For me, I am off to read a novel",9

Is it too late to drag Rahul Dravid out of retirement and back into the XI?,6
If Jos Buttler wins this he's legendary lol,7
All you lot who said Samson would have a good first few games and then do absolutely fuck all after look like you know what you were talking about. The Royals all of a sudden look like the worst team in the tournament.,12
are they planning to get one player out per over? all out by the 10th over I reckon,9
"wasnt there a stat that said sanju samson plays incredibly well for the first 3-4 games and gets his majority runs there, then shits the bed for the rest of the tournament",21

Is it RCB batting or RR kinda hard to tell?,1
Maybe the case study of Pant vs Samson will force more people to see that how you look when you score runs or get out is irrelevant.,5

"**8.1** Chahar to Lomror, OUT, **incredible catch running backwards from extra cover!** Looks like Anukul Roy, a sub. Full ball outside off, looks to heave leg side, gets a leading edge that's headed towards landing just past where mid-off might've been. He sprints backwards and to his left and pull out a full-length dive to hold on to that. Brilliant **42-4**

MK Lomror c sub (AS Roy) b Chahar 11 (13b 1x4 0x6) SR: 84.61",6
Atleast we'll get to see Buttler tonk a few,5

RR has only taken 3 wickets in powerplay they really don't have any new ball bowler. How was Tyagi today just saw Ben Stokes tweet comparing to Binga & Ishantm,1
Mumbai Indians vs England,14
Yet again the dream of not having the lowest IPL score has been crushed,29
Why not send Tewatia to counter Krunal?,4
So many English players on RR,7
Samson is wasting his talent. Consistency is essential for his progress to next level. May be protect the guy and move him down so that he can bat after 10 overs. Less pressure for him to thrive.,7
"That some big ballz shit rn, wicket playing for a shot, and then Buttler comes and pops a 6",8
Remember when we used to call the lord TWAT?,12
Lmao I think that catch just sums up the quality gap between the two teams.,9
Tom curran in his photo looks like he‚Äôs about to cry,7
I have no idea why the dude is called Buttler when he is actually Batman.,10
Pollard's reaction to Anukul's catch is so wholesome,13
"Butler looks done. He wants to know what's in dinner, that everyone is in such a rush to pavilion.",11
Two Englishmen on. Come on now!,11
Kishans hair style looks good on him with the hat on but atrocious when he removes the hat,6
"Krishan, Jaiswal following Zampa into the mullet look",2
If Butler plays 20 overs it will be interesting atleast,19
"Tom, Ben, and Sam Curran.

Must have been a fun household to grow up in",13
RR should have never dropped Rahane. Now they are struggling for a solid Indian batsman. And Rahane is completely wasted in DC right now.,6
I don't know how an professional team like rr do this every ipl. They always lack an indian talent brings an talent and they lack consistency. How can an side in ipl have neither own or brought good indian players.,0
Man Sri Lanka board needs to give Jayawardene some coaching job. It can't be a fluke he has turned this time into a giant,4

Whitehatjr you can change your advert but that still wont make me care about coding for kids,2

"Woah, has Pollard shaved?",5
"I don't get it, why do people retort by calling Rahane a test player when informed it was a mistake on RR's part to release the player who provides them much needed stability at the top? 

Take a look at these players' strike rates and tell me what is it that Rahane lacks that others apparently don't?

S. Dhawan: 124.7 (avg 32.9)

G. Gambhir: 123.91 (avg 31.01)

A. Rahane: 121.93 (32.93)

Why doesnt buttler fail aginst mi why is he so consistent aginst mi what drives him idk did he have a personal problem or something against mi when whole rr is struggling Jo's buttler is batting with a healthy strike rate and is smashing runs?,14
Krunal's overconfidence costing him,4
Jos is so good,8

"That‚Äôs it Buttler, keep your head in the game mate",6
I'm an RR fan. Hope is all I have.,6
Just keep Butler out of strike and send all other batsman home.,5
Watch Buttler + Tewatia scoring 110 in last 5 overs.,8
I am surprised Alex Hales is not in IPL given that he is not on National radar. He could've been useful anywhere.,6
Krunal gave away as many runs in one over as he scored in 3,1
"somehow i forgot all about yashaswi jaiswal during no-cricket days. googled him just now..wow, there was a lot of hype! hope he doesn't turn into another unmukt chand",2

Da fuck. Bumrah bowled 2 overs?,7

Ashwin vs Buttler @Sharjah üòè,6
Buttler's range hitting ability is just ridiculous.,3
I think Smith hates Poms so much he doesn't even score runs for RR.,6
The stadium DJ is proper crap,6
Last match krunal was talking and shouting at himself and today Hardik seemed to do the same thing. What‚Äôs going on?,8
"If someone can still win it from here, it‚Äôs Buttler, RR still have some hope",5

Clive Rose vents between Tassie and UAE. Noone's calling him out!,2

Swann is such a joker,3
Someone the other day made a comment about chahar looking like 6ix9ine. Cracks me up whenever he gets on screen.,7
That was a good save by QDK. He was blinded by Curran,5
"Curran rotate the strike, thats all needed.",6
"Think Smith wants to prove he is a great T20 batsmen as well, he is trying too hard but failing",3
Really nice of Buttler to stall for a few overs and give MI some respite before the Tewatia-Curran onslaught,9
Its just such a waste having this music and crowd noise in the stadium.,5
"If anyone thinks this is a wicket alert over, reply below. Let's do this every over!",7
Hardik and De Cock,8
Tom is trying to be aggressive today,6
Good over given the situation but considering we need overs better than that every time I still don't fancy our chances. Perhaps if we have overs like this every time where Buttler clouts one or two boundaries and gets 12 each over and then a biggie with 20+ runs in the over to get back into the game?,3

BC Curran hit!,1
De Kock is a proper WK. One of the big reasons he'll always keep over Kishan.,4

Sometime soon Rajestan might be 74-4 again but with Buttler and Stokes. And the game will still feel winnable,8
I wonder if the person on here who told me Buttler should be dropped for the next match is watching...,7
I‚Äôm about to cry over a pom,2
Mumbai still has five overs of pace left. We just need to be done with the four of spin+whatever pollard does without giving away too many and we should be safe,1
Alright it has stopped being funny now. Please stop bowling trash you fuckin fool.,6

They won't bowl pies too often....Would be an uphill task even for butler...he might be forced to hit good deliveries and perish",2

Classic pollard making it look tougher than it should have been,3
Pollard take a bow! What a catch!,7
Tom Curran is type of player who can bat higher but shouldn't.,3
That was the only way we could get Jos out. A superhuman effort to stop a just as brilliant innings.,12
Fantasy players with Polly get some respite in terms of fielding points,2

RR trying hard to dont f**k NRR,-2
"Tom should just take the single and let Tewatia have a go at us. He's barely getting bat on ball.

Tom Curran isn't adding anything to the side really,6
That 2014 catch up Pollard had to be Catch of the IPL till date,12
Lord archer is here,8
I honestly feel Archer would be a bigger threat than Curran right now.,6
MIs NRR goes Brrrr,7
Now we just need Ben Stokes to come in and Steve Smith to not play like a tailender and we can at least stop being shit,8

Not anything near impossible. Two lords at crease,5
Makes me happy how Buttler found his form before the dc match,4

If Tewatia wins it for RR from here i will not eat vada pavs for a year,11
Who gonna win?,1
Does Pollard really need that long of a run-up? I think its just to fuck with the batsmen,5
MI is just full of match winners. It‚Äôs not the same guy who performs in every match and today‚Äôs it‚Äôs Yadav. Envious stuff,7

God the dj is a mess,2
"Bumrah is back and I would like to give credit to Zaheer, remember him saying "" Bumrah won't be back to his best self at best bowling Yorkers after Yorkers, he will need to get his speed and natural good length delivery entact first than get his rhythm back in couple matches before"".

Sometimes you just want to hear that the game is buried",5
Bumrah's yorkers are back,2
How the actual hell  are Mumbai so bloody good? It's not the fact that they can buy great players (though of course that comes into play). It's how they can get all of those players to work together as such a seamless unit. Boult and Bumrah have never played in the same team until now and now seem like they've been bowling in tandem for ages. Nobody rated Patto as an extraordinary T20 seamer and yet he's been filling the enforcer role so well despite never having played the IPL before. How on earth do they do it?,15
In post match presentation tough questions needs to be asked like what you think of your batting form Mr. Smith?,3
The strategy against MI and DC is pretty clear. Win the toss and bat first. They have a good bowling attack to defend pretty much anything.,7

"**15.5** Bumrah to Gopal, OUT, **taken behind.** That rose up at Gopal, and then it rose up at QDK too. Some fire in that delivery. Short of a length, just outside off. Looks to stab it down to third man and gets the outside edge. QDK is...let's say woken up by that one, to his right **115-8**

Bumrah - 9.
Pattinson - 8.
Undoubtedly one of the best bowling attack.",10
Bumrah 5 for anyone?,5
its scary if Bumrah peaks slowly and bowls at his best during playoffs. There is no way MI can lose with this bowling attack. Only DC is close. Mumbai batting has more experience.,11
Stop shitting on Tewatia; dude needs 19 balls to settle,16
Kind of the rest of RR getting out so fast so Archer's strike rate doesn't get ruined by Bumrah.,6
"**Jofra Archer's 3.13 Balls per Six is the best among batsmen who have scored at least fifty runs in IPL2020**

Imagine if that Buttler yorker miss would have gone on to hit the stumps,11
& I thought SRH middle order was weak.,9
Buttler and Archer are the imposters in RR,7
archer can you cunt some sixes just for fun please,5
Lol these cred ads are so lazy.,4
RR is what playing without management looks like.,5
CSK would be ashamed of this run chase. Not even playing for NRR.,7
How can you have someone in your side hit a 70(44) and still look like you won't even make 130,13
Competition between Boult and Bumbrah to see who gets the last 2,7

"MI vs DC, a virtual final on Sunday. Good 4 day rest for the bois before the game",5
Man i'd really want a new Champion this season. MI tho has other plans i guess.,8
Quick stat: Mumbai has 4 bowlers among the top 10 wicket takers this season. Maybe this year they'll get their first purple cap since peak malinga,10
Why does the match bot have an RCB flair?,10
How the fuck does that go for six,3
Boult man bowl well for your stats. U don't wanna win the match and have bad stats. Btw Joffra plays those shorts balls well.,2
Rajasthan should promote Archer and send him as a pinch hitter.,3

Shit team. SHITE!!! SHITE!!!!! SHITE!!!!!!!!,3
"Lmao calling CSK ""dads army"" is peak Danny Morrison",6
DC vs MI on Sunday is gonna be one hell of a match. Possible prelude to the final.,9
"At this point, can RR just stay this dumb for the DC match? Thanks in advance!!",3
"For one last time, SHARJAH IS NOT RAJASTHAN'S HOME GROUND THIS YEAR.

They gonna play just 3 games there, like EVERY other team. The one on Friday vs DC gonna be the last one. Next 8 games in Abu Dhabi and Dubai",2
Why doesn't Pollard the biggest ~~Mumbai~~ West Indian simply eat the rest of Mumbai Indians?,4
This is gonna be a big over,1
Whom did DC get for trading Boult to MI?,3
MI is obviously an incredibly strong team but they‚Äôve also had luck over the years. I can‚Äôt recall a time when they‚Äôve lost a key player to injury or scheduling conflict. And they‚Äôve also won many key tosses.,2
Archer should be promoted to 4,3
"If Chennai is Dad's Army, does that make Sam Curran Pike?",4
Qdk with those amazing saves has atleast saved 15 runs,5
QDK has been immense for us behind the stumps.,3

Still confident though. Their bowling is nothing special apart from Bumrah. We have a more balanced team.",6

Mumbai be like after all it's IPL 13 bitches.,12
All MI do is destroy other teams NRR,14
Want opinions.....should bumrah open with Boult as Pattison is a very good middle overs bowler?,5
"Let's be honest, apart from that first match where it is expected a team to be rusty to kick off, MI has done everything right. Even the game against RCB, they came from nowhere to tie it by hitting 80+ in 4 overs and lost a super over which is a toss up most of the times.

So far, MI and DC are looking like standout sides from the competition. I'd say MI def looks better on paper than DC as well.",16
"Not a good batting performance by Royals but they were overmatched against this MI bowling. MI scored way too much. Only way RR can win is their top order has to play out of their skin. That did not happen minus Jos. 

MI is in a great situation. Everyone have scored runs and they have many levers to push. If Hardik starts to bowl their bowling will get even better.",8
"One kinda close loss against CSK and other than that, 4 wins and 1 super over loss",10
"Somewhere in the hotel room csk would be smiling with these heavy defeats of other teams..
Rcb lost big, now royals...if we consider MI and DC to be the two sure teams for playoffs ..srh is down with Bhuvi, kxip have lost the plot, rcb blowing too cold some hot, kkr getting plugged due to Karthik ego as batsman..

26 catches in 64 IPL matches

So I was right I suppose, but not by a whole lot.",11
"RR England players: 109 runs

RR other 7 players: 25 runs

Doesn't look good for RR with Smith and Samson being shit over and over,16
That year old tradition ( 8 years now?) of playing two Foreign Pacers is the real chit code.,28
Don‚Äôt keep too much hopes from Ben stokes as well he doesn‚Äôt do great in IPL,10
"This looked so much like the previous game, team batting first scores big close to 200, team batting second loses the plot in the powerplay itself losing 3 wickets, only 1 batsman even gets past 40 and can't do much with everyone falling apart, bowling team's premier bowler takes a 4-for, and BEAMERS, lots and lots of Beamers!",10
"Bumrah has returned with a vengeance after a difficult start to this IPL, he has got 8 wickets in 3 games.",18
"Alright guys, imma bounce :P

Until Tomorrow! Hopefully KKR forces CSK Uncles into retirement",21
"Guys Hardik hasn't bowled yet. Hopefully when he does , he'll bring more power to this pace attack.",24
MOM should be Surya. He played brilliantly. Bumrah's expected to bowl well. Surya's 6 against Archer was shot of the tournament.,34

Eagerly waiting for Pandya ready for bowling. Mi will be op of whole another level.,15
"One thing I like about CSK and MI is they don‚Äôt do too much stupidity which prevails in abundance in other teams.

Example from today‚Äôs match, you simply don‚Äôt attack till Buttler gets out. Just support him adequately and setup a platform to launch. But we saw Smith and Samson literally throw their wickets away. MI and CSK simply don‚Äôt do such stupidity.",22
"The worst thing about RR is that it is heavily relied on it's foreign players in both departments. Samson, who is their best Indian player is super inconsistent. They definitely need more contributions from Indians in both the departments.",27
Joffra just don't give a fuck about that award üòÅ,24
"Good news for other teams is MI cannot retain all the players they have. I am thinking retaining Rohit, Pandya, Bumrah and RTM Surya and Pollard. Rest they have to buy. Wont be easy.",20
Post match thread?,10
Buttler hurting with that fake smile,23
Can we start having good games again? Wtf are these 190 vs 130 matches.,40
So MI needs to win 3 from the remaining 8 matches to get into the playoffs? Surely that NRR can help them clear even with 7 wins.,19
Did social media vilify NRR batting so much that teams just stopped doing it altogether? /s,11
wtf Rohit lost weight in 2 days or what?,15
Ngl I don't mind these one sided domination when my boiis Bumrah and Boult are on song. I'm going re-watch RR fall of wickets again just to rejoice my boiis playing so well.,31
When will MI play Lynn? He is far more entertaining than Qdk,-27
The way SKY hit six after getting hit on head was amazing.,27
Smith has been throwing his wicket away since last 3 matches. I need to stop picking him in my fantasy team.,24

So much fun watching the matches with you folks,14
Awesome,1
"Mumbai over the years have just built a team which isn't at all over reliant on foreign players and their scouting department is just top notch. I think every other team other than SRH atleast have one player who has made his IPL debut with Mumbai.
KKR- Nitish Rana, Siddesh Lad
RCB- Chahal
CSK- Rayudu
RR- Shreyas Gopal
KXIP- Jagadeesha Suchith
DC - Rahane and Dhawan (I'm not entirely sure about this one)
I might have missed out some but you get the point. It's a very balanced squad and at most maybe lack a spinner but the pace attack kind of makes up for it.",3
