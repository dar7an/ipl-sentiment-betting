Halla Bol vs Ben Stokes,1
What we need is to drop Uthappa and Parag. Maybe bring in Yashasvi and Manan Vohra?,6
the Royal Dravid derby!!,10
Buttler smith 100+ opening stand is all I need,8
Any news on Morris's match fitness?,4
RR please play Jaiswal. Please.,7
Off topic : Guru Randhawa is a good artist,-10
What time does this begin in IST? The thread says 2pm local time.,3
Heh ain't this way too early,4
"RR pls give Robbie one more chance this match

RCB needs him",7
I will lose my shit if Shreyas Gopal picks the wicket of Virat and ABD,35
Does anyone know of captains pick their playing 11 before or after toss?,2
"[RCB in afternoon games](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/j4csit/ipl_teams_in_afternoon_games_in_last_2_years/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

Two of those 6 losses came against RR in 2018, including the last league game, virtually a knockout",5
Kohli averages 21 at a SR of 106 against RR.,5
what are official IPL fantasy rules today? Separate team for each game or only one team a one matchday?,3
"RCB has the underdog tag today, and my heart always roots for underdogs. That, and Kohli-vs-Smith.",5
Ben stokes is arriving tonight in RR‚Äôs camp ü•≥ü•≥,8
Lmao Smudge forgetting Ankit Rajpoot's name,8
When will Ben Stokes be allowed to play?,1
"RCB should make three changes. Morris for Udana, Moeen for Zampa and Siraj for Gurkeerat.",3
"Fuck. Robbie is playing again, does he have nudes of RR selectors and owners?",10
RR deciding to bat first after winning the toss. Teams may have finally seen the light!,8
No Jaiswal üò°,6
They‚Äôre playing Uthappa. No words,2
"Robbie over Jaiswal, thank you RRüòç",20
I still think morris should've replace either zampa or udana. It would not only address death bowling issues but also give stability in the lower order,1
"Pitch with patches on it, how effective will be three spinners today?",6
"Hoping for a Buttler special finally. I think he is a much better batsman while batting first than when chasing.

Edit: Actually, no. Just looked it up. He has a much better record while chasing.",3
I hope AB would be okay to bat after WKing for 20 overs. Last match it didn't seem good for him.,3
I wanna see how AB bats after keeping wickets in this heat. Crucial that the openers don't fall early.,16
Navdeep Saini and Washington to start??? ü§îü§î,3
First place on the cards boys!!,5
"We're F(U)-Thhapa/Nadkat-(CKED),",4
I expect 20+ from Koach today üòî,6
"As much as i appreciate RR doing great this year, I think they‚Äôre a bubble and likely will burst. They‚Äôll barely reach 120 if they lose Buttler and Samson early.",2
AITA for expecting 20+ from koach?,3
Scared for de villiers. Gotta keep in this heat. And he got dehydrated last time,3
"Good bot, forgot about the match.",4
Kohli ABD or Smith for fantasy? What ya reckon,1
Virat should get Dube to bowl an over or two,2
I feel bad for ABD.,6
Uthappa is one of the highest run scorers in IPL! Lack of competitive cricket for him has been a reason for his rustiness! RR should have Uthappa to open with Buttler to give him some time and have smith at 4 to bring stability and balance to the side!,-1
AB will be screwed keeping in this heat and then batting,3
Will Virat ever win a toss?!,7
Rr bowling is thin,1
Rcb risking too much by throwing their best batsman to glovework.  Parthiv. Could be used instead of gurkeerat,4
Play Jaiswal you twunts,2
Felt so happy that SRH finally gave a chance to the youngsters. RR should give Jaiswal a chance instead of sticking to worn out players like Uthappa. In fact Jaiswal did so well in the U19 WC that the middle order barely had to bat in the tournament.,2
"Alright lads I've been convinced. I'm ready for the memes. I'm ready for the pain.

Let's go Virat Kohli's barmy army",13
Complete incompetence from kholi to play the same team. Ffs play your attacking batsmen and leader parthiv,7
"Ab was finished the other night, this is an afternoon match,I hope he will be alright.",2
"ABD is keeping wickets today as well, Kohli should have gotten Parthiv instead of gurkeerat so ABD can focus on batting and not injured doing both in this heat. Last match itself he was dehydrated and couldn't come out to accept the MOM award, if ABD goes home injured it will be a bigger loss for RCB . When is kohli going to learn small gains are not worth the big risk he is taking",6
Fuck Popcorn . Anyone wants chane??? ü§î,2
RCB being RCB by risking AB injury for couple of wins and top of the table in the early stages,4
I can't understand why they're persisting with Uthappa,4
Wonder if Sharjahsthan Royals can reclaim their original name today,5
"I dunno why you guys hate Uthappa, it tastes much better than a Dosa",6
RR bowling a little light IMO. Lomror is more of a batting all rounder,4
"Can Sanju ""Sharjah"" Samson do well today? Stay tuned to find out!",3
"Tbh, RR's decision to make Smith open (even after Buttler is back) is a bit weird. 

The likes of Samson, Jaiswal and even Uthappa (if he is in the playing XI) would be better choices to open with Buttler.",6
Is there any sub reddit for fantasy ipl or a site or Twitter i should follow,1
[deleted],2
Is Saini a Sikh?,1
RR spent over 3 Cr on Uthappa but that money was better spent on getting a local pacer or batsman. He could‚Äôve been KXIP‚Äôs problem.,4
Uthappa's domestic form was weak. Are people having unreasonable expectations from him based on his past kkr form?,1
[deleted],4
"Even if Uthappa does good in one inning at last... sitting Jaiswal (the guy who is as good as youngsters from yesterday's match, arguably better, and had been better than even current sensation devdutt of RCB in all their tourneys till ipl) isn't worth it, why waste 2.4cr on him man, that guy can be a buy for years if nurtured good, which RR is known for, still...",6
Not to be *that pom* but is Stokes playing today?,5
These guys are gonna die in the heat,5
"Inshallah, boy tossed well",12
I predict its gonna be a shitshow from either of the sides.,1
Ma RCB boyz ready ?,1
Why waste an overseas spot on Zampa?,2
"Smith couldn't remember the name of the guy he dropped, lol. Harsha had to tell him the name.",19
Steve Smith is so good man,6
Zampa and Yuzi Chahal. Why? ü§î,1
the last best rcb afternoon match for me was vs GL where kohli scored 100 in the last over.,6
What mobile app do you guys use for reddit? I am using Sync rn but I need to manually keep refreshing the thread which gets a little tedious!,2
Gonna go in with a losing mindset so it doesn‚Äôt hurt as much when it happens,5
Why does this game start so early?,5
Hope Jos gets going today,2
Uthappa? He‚Äôs been shit for the last 4 seasons why do they keep playing him?,3
I‚Äôm really liking Smith opening this season. Captain leading from the front,3
HALLA BOL! Let's go ‚ù§Ô∏è,4
Fans of both teams are expecting their team to lose lol wtf,12
"All of you shitting on Koach for ""making"" Abd keep is ridiculous lmao, Surely Abd wouldn't do anything that he himself wouldn't believe he is able to. Not to mention the plethora of support staff at their disposal that would advise against something of this sort. Case in point, Morris: a key player in the setup is out due to a niggle, and even though he's performing in net sessions the team is erring on the side of caution, which is how it should be",4
Only here because it's pissing it down at Finals Day :(,4
Damn im sweating just by seeing them,8
Today is Buttler's day.,4
That was literally just a flick wtf,2
Ah shit here we go,5
damn Kohli is keeping Negi out of the team,4
So which of you are going into the cabin with ~~smith~~ Zampa today?,3
"I remember Gurkeerat keeping 4-5 years ago. Also, he dropped a catch in the outfield in the last match. Considering ABD's fielding skills at the boundary and any injury to him would completely derail RCB's tournament, better let Gurkeerat keep in this match. If he is really shit at keeping, replace him with Parthiv Patel. Parthiv can bat at 5 if RCB are 3 down inside 10 overs. Otherwise he could bat at 9 behind Dube, Sundar and Morris/Udana. ABD is too important for RCB especially with Kohli's slump.",5
[deleted],3
udana wicket udaana.,13
lol 100kmp with new ball,7
Hope they both get going,3
"I‚Äôm near the stadium for something else and it‚Äôs hot. Those poor bowlers, fielders, and umpires",10
Can anyone tell the ground's name is it in sharjaha?,2
"these early games are perfect for Sydney, after DST the night games will be at 1.00am in Sydney

too late to watch live, wake up and watch replay",5
This was the first time that I saw the Dream11 cringe countdown and they got the numbers wrong.,5
It will be a peak RCB moment if ABD is ruled out of the IPL due to an illness or injury he gets from wicketkeeping,8
"Most bowlers have slower balls as their variety, Udana has faster ball as his variety",20
Fuck.. was there a gap for smudge. Not believable,3
99.1 wtf is this speed man,4
Left arm slow bowler,3
Having the players play in this heat has to be a new form of torture,6
"Isuru""bravo""udana",5
That was a shitty field placement.,4
Man afternoon IPL games are a completely different vibe. Love them so much.,4
When the fuck are bowlers gonna understand not to bowl on Smith's pad. Just bowl outside off ffs,4
Dhoni can only hit a boundary in dream11 ad,-4
Isuru is just Lankan Rajat Bhatia,1
Why do you even bother bowling on the pads to Steve Smith,4
is stokes in for this one?,2
There are three times more Afghan players in the IPL than Sri Lankan.,16
the black in rcbs jersey is to absorb solar energy for extra intent.,19
Please meme Udana into performing better r/Cricket,13
Bowlers need to understand: Steve Smith is not getting out trying to flick the ball on his pads.,1
Shouldn't really be playing in this kinda heat imo. At least have more frequent drinks breaks,4
I don't recall Udana opening the bowling for SL,2
This reminds me. Does anybody have the link to the video where Steve Smith plays really funny shots to avoid an LBW /caught behind the wicket?,3
Buttler!!!!,2
Can we change the captain and vice captain of our fantasy team in the 2nd match today?,3
Buttler‚Äôs ‚ÄúNo‚Äù is so soft compared to Morgan‚Äôs,4
Afternoon Match. Can expect big... big... huge... giant turn.,3
Damn that 4D chess bluff from Buttler,7
glad there's some breeze on this ground atleast,7
Mumbai people would feel right at home in this weather,19
Fuckin look at the heat,11
So.... when the fuck is Morris planning to play for RCB? We bought him for 10 cr. Expensive buy and he just be vibin' on the bench,8
"Huh, no 6 conceded yet

Its our day bois",13
Excuse me what?? Match now??,10
Even the AI crowd is dead today due to the heat,51
"First game I‚Äôm able to watch, and fortunately it‚Äôs RR

Come on Jos <3",11
Lol.. lenskart ad.,3
Its 35C with 70% humidity dont cry about it that's like a normal summer day in Mumbai.,9
Feel for ABD today he'll be almost dead after the match today.,6
"BCCI got so sick of the Indian fielders blaming the lights for the dropped catches

they made it a day game",1
Oh Jos,6
Udana= Umesh 2.0?,-2
Save slower ones for end Udana!,1
Butler day please,4
I love seeing slow balls get smashed for six.,4
Hmm the match threads are calmer. What happens to you guys after the sun sets?,7
"no one compliment buttler just yet, y‚Äôall are gonna jinx it I swear",7
Udana bowls at a very lethal pace. We are just watching everything in live slo mo.,9
"Do you open the bowling?

No, I am a ....

Here you go Vaas",2
Why we playing this trundler again?,1
Sri Lankan Olivier Giroud getting tonked.,3
Lmao at Washi searching Kohli's pants,4
Man buttler makes hitting sixes look easy,5
Its just Umesh Yadana,1
This is set for high scoring entertainment,3
"So, basically RCB are fucked. Butler is in the mood.",3
"Smudge seems to have reduced the aggressiveness of his play and is playing the long game. Good, now Buttler will score and Smudge will keep the game alive.

Edit: fuck",3
Opening bowler should be able to bowl at 140,2
Jos the boss has entered the IPL chat,4
Udana is definitely not a new ball bowler,4
Effortless!,0
"I know Steyn wasn't impressive this season when he played, but how on earth is Udana an improvement?

Edit: Jinxed",-3
Difference between butler and maxwell butler actually scores something in ipl,2
Lmao what is this bowling pace,1
Does Virat have enough sunglasses?,6
"Wow, he's just so strong and handsome",2
"On one hand you have Archer steaming in at 140 with the new ball. 

And then you have Udana bowling 99",6
Fuck no no no,1
butler trying to get dismissed so that he can go back to the AC dressing room but instead getting boundaries.,9
This heat isn't helping RCB either,5
RR probably chose to bat first because they didn't wanna field in this heat,6
Lol smith,6
YAS UDANA !,9
NOOO SMITH,6
"There you go!!

That's the start.",6
Lol. He took a wicket because the ball was too slow,5
"I get that Steyn cannot bowl at the death but he's still a far better new ball Bowler than Udana. And I'm not sure if Udana is that great at the Death either

Edit: Udana be proving me wrong",2
nooo was hoping to see zampa bowl at smith,1
"Fuck Yes

But ffs Smith was my fantasy captain",7
lol. r/cricket speaking too soon once again,11
Umesh Yadav wouldn't have picked that wicket.,5
"Are they playing ""Malinga Malinga chants"" when Udana is bowling or am I hearing things?",5
Lol anil kumble bowls faster than udana.,10
Yaaaay thanks for the reverse jinx!,4
Oh well what do we know about cricket,11
Rajat Bhatia would do the same job as Udana and would free an overseas spot,4
Hopefully this is the last match where Smith opens. Doesn't suit his game.,9
"**2.4** Udana to Smith, OUT, **chopped on!** **27-1**

SPD Smith  b Udana 5 (5b 1x4 0x6) SR: 100.00",5
Samson‚Äôs gonna hit a 100 today,6
Udana is better than Steyn dont @me,8
Fuck I want this to be high scoring,4
Royal collapse?,2
We do wickets too? üòØ,6
Why is Smith opening this season again ?,3
It's that time of the season where Samson starts shitting the bed right. I read the stats recently.,6
"Smith will have to give up his opening position

he's forcing it too much",4
"If Smith's gameplay is to play aggressive and not hold one end up, I think he is better of sending Samson to open with Butler while he controls the innings from number 3.",6
Smudge failed. So Kohli's gonna score today,3
Udana is bowling at kumbles pace,5
Just get these top 3 out and it's on!!,2
"Smith is needed to play his best in these grounds man, hopefully he is back to form next match !!",5
Oh my god. A touch shot.,4
the ball just waltzed over to the boundary,1
Timing and class sexy asf,1
He just touched the ball. Wow,4
As Sweet as it can get.,1
Wtf is this ground. Sanju just touches the ball and it goes for four.,6
Someone tell Darren Ganga that 127 kmph is Udana's full-pace delivery.,6
[deleted],1
God that was timed beautifully,6
Beauty,1
"Samson should do really well here. After all, it's his home ground.",6
I‚Äôm getting hot just by watching them. Can only imagine how hot it is.,2
"Brian Lara's voice man , dude can be a singer",2
Kohli should drop AB next match. Don't at me.,-8
"Sanju, he who sapped all the life energy and cricket spirit out of Virat Kohli, punches a glorious shot to the covers for a boundary",2
"They could have atleast played the afternoon game in Dubai, theres atleast some shade due to the big stands, unlike this ground which is completely open",1
I don‚Äôt even follow SL cricket but I‚Äôm pretty sure Udana‚Äôs the type of bowler who goes for plenty but picks up a key wicket.,4
"If they want to play stokes, smith is the only one deserving to be benched",3
Wait is it the heat or the fielder there didn't even bother chasing that ball? Virat?,4
RCBians touching themselves on this slow bowling,4
Samson has scored boundary off the first ball in last 3 matches,7
Bruh!!!!!!,6
Fuck that was amazing catch,9
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaa,6
Holy shit fuck yes eat shit r/cricket,13
"Go go, Saini my boi!!",7
Amazing!!,3
Obligatory Virat Kohli would have dropped that catch,27
Buttler was cruising for a bruising,5
Petition to rename Dinda academy to RCB academy,5
What a catch!!,9
Devdutt already our star,9
Nooo,3
So it's gonna be samson and tewatia today,6
That was bowled according to plan. Good on RCB. Hope MI is taking notes on how to get Jos out.,7
Get that man in the slip cordon for test team,12
Man Saini is our best bowler by far,15
Wait what? Is this fantasy cricket? üòØüòØ,4
Sachin Tendulkar 3rd Umpire?,13
Fuck yeah,6
And I thought this would be a high scoring game,7
TEST CRICKET FIELDING‚Ñ¢,8
Damn RCB taking important wickets with bowling. Maybe they should switch their home ground.,8
GG EZ,3
Yo wtf how did padikkal catch that,6
What a sexy ball,1
TEWATIA NOW OR WE RIOT,6
Shouldn't he be checking the ball go in the fielder's hand too?,4
"Forever Buttler, never a batman",3
Time for Sanju Samson to show us he can dominate outside Sharjah,4
When did sachin started 3rd umpiring ?,27
Get samsung and RR is done for the day.,4
"HUH???

CHECK THE CATCH BHENCHOD",13
"**3.1** Saini to Buttler, OUT, **taken at first slip!** But is that a bump ball? **Soft signal is out.** It was a yorke length ball outside off that Buttler was looking to drive, so there's a lot of jamming action happening which can complicate such calls. **31-2**

JC Buttler c Padikkal b Saini 22 (12b 3x4 1x6) SR: 183.33",6
"I was regretting not making buttler my dream xi captain, not anymore.",9
Match is set for Uthappa now,8
I am not going to watch Uthappa bat for 17 overs,9
Why not check the catch?,5
I thought the review was for the catch not whether he hit it?,8
Can we see a team get into the playoffs with 10 points. Will 2020 be the year?,9
All you fools not realising this will just lead to a Tom Curran 107 (48),17
Third umpire sounds like Sachin,3
I hope we give Saini a chance to prove himself in Australian tour,9
RCB into the tail already...,9
Uthappa's farewell innings,11
It's Today or never for utthapa,9
Into the tail now.,9
"Who would win

Mallu Sixer Chad

or

Some fast boi",8
Inb4 Uthappa masterclass,5
RCB into the tail already...,8
Lol 2 slips,9
Am I dreaming 2 slips with RCB bowling.,13
RCB would have done a lot better if chinnaswamy was not their home ground. Don't@me,34
Tf he obviously hit it I thought they were checking that the catch was clean,7
that looked like a dropped catch...,2
Huaweiooo,1
"RCB in a good position, now Sanju and Uthappa have to uplift for RR",3
Koach keeping two slips. That's some unlike RCB stuff,3
"2 slips to Uthappa, the disrespect.",4
"146, 144, 143",4
Robbie anna please spare your home team bros. We good na? ü§ó,12
This is the exact situation Smith should be walking in to control the innings. RR have got their batting order all messed up. This is the same mistake RCB used to make in the previous seasons.,11
Kohli would have 100% dropped that,6
"Full time cricket analyst, part time batsman Robin Uthappa comes to bat",6
Uthappa out there to prove r/cricket wrong,6
Uthappa redemption arc???,11
y‚Äôall what if choke like really bad,3
"Uthappa was a beast in 2014, now he's just a shadow",4
"Kohli would have dropped that catch, Buttler should have sledged Kohli to get him to stand at slip",11
Catch of the tournament so far,6
Devdutt has the safest pair of hands in this RCB side,6
Who will have more chances this ipl? Utthappa or Jadhav?,2
butler 2 down with Jaiswal and smith opening is a much better lineup for RR,3
I thought the third ump was called on to check the catch and not the edge itself.,4
RCB showing aggression in bowling. Maybe I'm seeing this after a decade,7
Uthappa seeing off the new ball,7
There‚Äôs something so satisfying about a slip catch. One of my favourite modes of dismissal.,5
Uthappa A shadow of himself now,4
Like the aggressive field setup by Virat.,4
Uthappa comes in : time to get some dot balls,4
"Don't take the wicket of uthappa, i repeat don't take the wicket of uthappa.",9
"Uthappa will hit a double century today









Oh don't mind me I'm just jinxing",15
So Kohli is using Saini exactly like how Rohit uses Bumrah.,9
Wicket Maiden Mother Fuckers,23
Wicket Maiden Cmon,9
Saini has bowled most dots for RCB this season - 31 so far,13
"Jofra at 10?

Look how they massacred my boy..",36
Maiden? What does this word mean?,11
Uthappa please,6
Ridiculously amazing stuff Saini,8
"RCB bowler with a wicket maiden?

This some 2020 shit",73
Damn saini,5
Wicket maiden,4
uthappa genuinely looks like an uthappam batting out there,3
Maiden wicket unheard of RCB.,4
"Wicket maiden!!

When did that happen for RCB in powerplay last time?",6
Wicket maiden! Uthapppaaaa,2
Saini bowling even better than Bumrah this season.,0
Robbie is wasting youngsters opportunity,1
Why doesn't RR look like a strong batting unit to me?,1
Mah boi Saini got a maiden over,3
Rest of the match is going to be painful to watch,1
Wth happened?,1
"If he fails, I think this will be the last innings ever of Uthappa in IPL.",1
Saini for the Australia tour pls. I want to see him bowling on those Australian grounds full pace along with bumrah and shami,5
Saini and bumrah will be bowling for India for the near future damn,4
When your local uncapped bowler is miles better than your international option.,3
Maiden wicket by an RCB bowler in a powerplay. Wow. I have seen everything now.,8
Friendship ended with umesh. Now Saini is my best friend,11
[deleted],5
F,2
Oh fuckkkkkkkkk.. get innnnn,3
RCB WTF!!!,3
üò¨,1
"Wicket maiden for Brett Lee's man! Wtf, lmao",2
I'm cryingüòÇüòÇüòÇ,3
Lmao.,2
We‚Äôre done for the day boys!!!!!!!,4
This is not a drill!! It's happening.,5
Lmao,4
RCB on fire. Top 3 gone.,5
Fuck yeah dm boi,6
RCB looking fucking dangerous team now,4
Damn,2
This is not the RCB I know. What is this 2020 year?,5
This has suddenly gone to shit,3
Loool RR,4
I thought bowling sundar in pp was working well. Why the change then?,2
Get fucked rajasthan,5
BITCHES!! SAMSUNG SLUMP IS ON!,5
Chahal the legend,5
Hahaha what a scene,2
What. The. Fuck,3
hahaha time for Sanju fanboys to go into meltdown.... Same story for last 3-4 years now,13
Is this really rcb?,4
Now don't lose the momentum Kohli,1
Fuck yeah baby üòé,1
"RCB, IS THAT REALLY YOU?????",1
Samson consistent with his 2019 form.,1
He does sound like Sachin,2
The aggression in the bowling worked OMG!!!!,5
"A bowling lineup consisting Bumrah, Saini, Bhuvi, Hardik, Chahal and Sundar looks ridiculously strong for T20s",3
Right,2
Time to send in Tom Curran to rescue the innings with a gritty 50,2
Hell yeah!,2
So samson's season has started,5
Steve Smith after match: we thought we were playing in Sharjah,3
what a TRAINWRECK.,2
r/cricket eat shit and die!!!,1
This is so painful to watch,3
not out,0
RCB slaying today,3
Well looks like it's RCB today.,3
"can‚Äôt even get mad at RCB, we‚Äôre just this bad lol",7
This just might be Bangalore's year,1
I am not an ent but I guess this is how it feels? üò≥üò≥,3
That‚Äôs out,3
Not my RCB,2
RR still thinking they're playing in Sharjah,7
RCB fielding. Kohli has a tear in his eye if you look carefully.,7
;-;,1
"Fingers under the ball, out",1
Wow! Great catching.,1
Is Sachin third umpire today?,7
If the BC umpire doesnt give this out...,5
Fingers under the ball!!,5
I want off this ride.,3
Not out?,0
Looks not out,1
Bach gaya Samson,0
"Was just going to comment how if this could be a pivotal innings for Samson. He‚Äôs always started the IPL well and never continued his form, so if he finally got a score here he could set the tournament alight

4(3). It‚Äôs not to be",5
bounced it,3
"**4.1** Chahal to Samson, OUT,  **31-3**

SV Samson c &amp; b Chahal 4 (3b 1x4 0x6) SR: 133.33",3
Jaiswal just played the one game surely deserves more games than Robin. He can open and Steve Smith can play at 3 or 4 controlling the innings.,4
"Where are the RR fans who were calling Samson the second coming of Bradman after his mandatory good performances at the first 2 games, that too at the postage stamp sized Sharjah",0
RCB has turned into prior 2015 csk. Csk has turned into 2017-2019 rcb.,0
Sanson needs to adapt to these pitches. Play like Pant,1
Samson form lasts lesser than I last in bed.,5
If RCB wins this match I'm changing my flair,4
Tendulkar is the 3rd ump,9
"Rock n roll, rock n roll",5
I just hope this inexperienced umpire doesn‚Äôt give it not out.,3
Not out,5
Grounded it,5
RCB: You are the meme now,6
Were the fingers under the ball now that's the question,3
Chahal pulling off good catches! RCB taking 3 wickets in PP! What the actual fuck 2020,8
Please don't reverse the decision,6
I don't think that's out. Will depend on the soft signal. What was the soft signal?,3
tewatia still there with his fingers in his ass,6
"its out, how much you gonna rock and roll",7
"Lol classic Samson

2 good performances to get everyone shouting about him playing for India

Then bang average performances for the rest of the tournament",14
It's CONTROVERSY TIME,5
Sachin pls don't ruin it for us,4
I like RR more than RCB but that‚Äôs gotta be given out,4
Did someone just swap RCB and CSK?,4
Have to be out because his finger might be underneath,7
Is umpire Tendulkar??,15
Samson always plays first two matches well and then just goes downhill in every IPL,5
RR is fucked now,2
SRT is the third umpire.,3
Not out tha bhenchod,2
Is that sachin as third umpire? Wtf,5
Huaweiiiooo yene barli,3
"Third umpire is Paschim Pathak,  impostor Sachin Tendulkar",6
"smith should come back down, jaiswal should open replacing uthappa",2
Is that Tendulkar on 3rd ump?,9
"Honedtly, soft signal should be abolished.",5
Sharjahstan Royals back to form,6
Idk about that one personally. Soft signal fucked him there,9
Sanju Sharjah Samsonü§≠,6
"Shout out to BBC radio who, with Blast finals day rained off seem to have just flicked the tv on in the commentary box and decided to commentate on this instead...",13
Mn wtf this is not right,9
Chahal had one finger in the right place,6
That‚Äôs a clear out,0
"Who would win

Mallu sixer Chad 

Or


Some weak ass tiktoker ?",50
No conclusive evidence.,5
Only RCB can lose from here,5
No ptsd if of Sanju fucking us,3
thanks Sachin,4
"Me, a neutral fan right now : *grabs popcorn*",6
Imagine the praises for Dhoni's captaincy if would have given consecutive overs to Saini and chahal both taking wickets on their 1st bowls.,14
"""Samson should get chances for India brigade"" says WHATTTTT",5
It's tewatia time,4
to the dude who wrote samsons gona hit a century today lol i bet u feel stupid now haha,5
Good on you ump! Was afraid he was gonna overturn that,3
Normalcy restored. Thnx Rajasthan,6
This is an incredible start. Amazing,1
Sharjah Samson fans represent.,3
Samson Unlucky here.,5
the ball touched the ground its not out,-3
"When things start going well, Virat is the most aggressive captain in the world, if not, he's all over the place",7
Seems like my boi Samson has already completed his allocated quotas of good innings for this IPL season as well,14
3rd umpire giving the benefit of the doubt to the bowler? Things are changing.,11
I would have given it not out,0
OUT,1
bega out kodo,5
"No controversy there, i was out",1
"Samson has not fared well against chahal in ipl , so good decision to get chahal to bowl",2
Fuck yeah we are in the tournament bros!,6
Agent Uthappa doing a fine job so far.,3
Mr Consistent Samson at it again this IPL,1
Samson continues his run of being consistently........ inconsistent,4
"RR shouldn't have flown in Warnie as their special advisor, he's bad luck",6
"I think he had finger under the ball, I‚Äôd say out",1
Lol,1
">only RCB can lose from here

No. RR can too",4
[deleted],8
That catch wasn't clean. Benefit of the doubt should have gone to the batsman,3
I am glad Sachin has taken up 3rd Umpiring.,13
RR are basically 31/4 with Robbie there,8
That is some agressive cricket,2
Out or not out ? * Grabs popcorn *,2
See you later Sanju!,2
"Pant>Samson, this always happens first 2 knocks are awe inspiring then its just a dud",14
"Yuzi fielding of his own bowling= Strong doge

Yuzi fielding of other bowling= Weak doge.

Somebody have the meme format?",4
just came here to appreciate VK's master stroke bowling change..üòâ,4
Time for Samson fans to quit watching IPL. He doesnt get better after the start of season.,9
Harsha is becoming more and more insufferable. Glad he's not on dugout.,0
Only Tewatia can save RR,6
Wtf happened to the powerplay batting this season,8
Samson hype still alive?,4
So AB might not break his back after all,5
Styris idea is correct but he's using a wrong example. The umpire call is BS when something happens in deep outfield.,4
Everything going WROGN for Rajasthan..,12
Already 4th bowler in just 5th over. Lol.,6
I would‚Äôve given up on this team by now but ever since I found out Stokes is coming back I‚Äôm wavering,4
lomror from gondor.,8
"Sanju ""only hits in first 2 matches"" Samson",14
Who is Lomror,3
People are surprised at RCB for performing but not at Sanju performance dip like every season LOL,13
Anyone miss the old rcb anthem? The ones back in 2009-2011,5
If it was CSK instead of RCB the everyone would have said csk fixed it and not being fair etc etc,-6
What exactly is the point of soft signal lol !?!,2
Nothing shot Samson. Not doing himself any favours,3
RCB being CSK and CSK being RCB,5
Lol warne putting his mask over his nose once he notices he's on camera.,7
I thought Lord tewatia deserved a promotion?,7
what is going on guys???,3
RCB bowling against RCB I meant the non existent middle order.,3
Jaiswal would have scored a century by now,4
Atlast some good catching from the RCB.,1
"Third umpire made the right call but that shouldn‚Äôt be the discussion, it should be on the SOFT SIGNAL",5
Really hoping that Royals pull off an SRH-style comeback and win this game.,1
Danny morrison loves the occasion more than the rest of us,3
"Now, can they do an SRH???",4
Wtf is Swann doing! Is there a point of all this,5
It must be a correct decision. That voice can not be wrong,7
"Things going good for RCB but this is RCB, don't believe until last over has been bowled",5
Harsha is becoming more and more insufferable. Glad he's not on dugout.,2
Did he just say Yuzi isn't the sharpest tool in the shed?,5
Robbie lolol,3
[deleted],-15
r/cricket let's troll Lomror to greatness,9
RR batsmen still under Sharjah hangover. Just swinging through the line while the ball is holding up on the pitch.,5
"Some one posted a stat where Samson scores 150 odd in first 3 games every year and then tapers off ,looks like RR are in trouble.",22
Yesterday Abhishek Sharma and Priyam Garg made it their day. Today another great opportunity for Mahipal Lomror and Riyan Parag.,6
Out or not out the umpire can see shit from that angle,9
Hope RCB don't fuck up this good start and bring that net runrate as much as possible.,15
"No tewatia, no fun",8
behold....Sanju-consistently doing good ONLY in first two matches-Samson,14
buttler the only RR player with any fantasy value...but jokes aside this is where RR needs Stokes to arrest a collapse in which u emerge only with robbie utthappa lol,9
Why are the rr batsmen playing like they want to get out?,3
"Finch is not going to catch Robin, they are going to have dinner afterwards",7
Sachin said it was inconclusive so it was. He was the most honest player on the field and so he will be as a 3rd Umpire too.,10
"If Robbie hits 50 here, I‚Äôll bite my socks",5
No worries. Tewatia will fuck last overs,1
Great opportunity for Robin Uthappa to screw.,11
Finchy was thinking about all the chicken wings and big macs he shared with uthappa while trying for that catch,8
Time to play for NRR bois...,7
"RCB, please don't Rcb this start",5
Feel like this game is pivotal to Uthappa's career going forward in the IPL.,4
Loving this aggressive captaincy from Virat,5
"so KIXP & now Royals are out, can't win the tournament",-2
Wait till Unadkat gives away these many runs in his first two overs itself,3
"Am I the only one who's gotten used to this DJ noise now, don't miss the crowd anymore tbh.",2
I need Washington Sundar in CSK :(,5
Lord Vinay!,1
Ab Rishabh devilliers,4
Uthappa will take them to 140,3
eVeRy cOmMenTaToR bAd,8
Probably speaking too soon. But we have great chance to improve the NRR this game.,2
Come on r/cricket you're better than this! Make a big issue of that Samson dismissal already,12
I guess bad performance and good captaincy go hand in hand for Indian captains :P,5
Rcb will go for review if they get uthappa out,9
Lord Garg would have said no to that run.,5
"I've cursed many sides to doing well .


So Uthappa is gonna bat like Ishant here I say.",9
The dj is incredibly biased,9
"Mahipal Lomror has Marnus Labuschange levels of meme potential, name wise of course",3
The impact is outside off lol,1
Uthappa will save RR inning. Mark my words. Or not. It's alright either way.,3
chUthappa should score big today.,0
Riyan Parag/ Priyam Garg are the Dylan McDermott/ Dermot Mulroney of India.,4
"Don't worry, Uthappa gonna win it for RCB.",3
Every bowler should sit down while appealing like Sundar did there,1
"RR Fans: We would have won if Samson- 'The most consistent batsman of all time', wasn't wrongly given out",4
REALLY MILK UTHAPPA NOW,2
"The way ball is sticking on the pitch and the fact that it will only get worse in the second innings, unadkat has a chance for redemption",1
Kohli's going to score 26* chasing down 100 target and pump up his chasing average,7
Lol sundar so committed there!! Love those moments.,4
Half hearted shot from Robbie,3
Just make lord Archer play last 2 overs so that he can cunt 11 sixes,10
"And this is why I wanted Jaiswal back and push Smith and Sanju down. 3 wickets in 5 overs and this game's fucking over. Now we've got useless fucking Uthappa. Inexperienced Lomror. Useless Parag. 99% chance useless Tewatia. Maybe Curran and Archer can drag us to 120 only for Unadkat to be absolutely pounded as usual and we lose.

Nothing fucking changes. Get out our top 3 and you win",9
"Kohli going ""dont catch it"" when Uthappa skies it",7
Why the hell would anyone buy Uthappa,5
Is that AB? I didn't know he was like Pant behind the stumps!,7
"Yes, why will you waste a drs just to get uthappa out",10
"Once upon a time in UAE:-

tf rcb,6
Everything was wrong with that shot,5
Every season I start to wonder why Samson is not a permanent member of Indian team and every season he lets me know the answer.,90
Nice pp,2
RR will score some runs with or without Uthappa getting out.,3
Alright RCB.Time to RCB thid excellent start,1
Amazing how much Uthappa has changed as a batsman. Fondly remember all the power packed knocks he played for RCB in 2009-10.,16
That lens kart ad is so good.,8
Samson Is over hyped AF. Can only Play in Sharjah,1
ROFL at that lenskart ad,6
Ok I love AB I really do but he is annoying wicketkeeper isn't he ?,-3
[thoughts?](https://i.imgur.com/zKuKAZe.jpg),1
Still don't get the aggressive batting of Smith,1
"RCB is doing great till now but De Villiers keeping for 20 overs is making me worried about his back.

He was dehydrated the previous match, the day match is going to be even harsher.",6
A) CHAHAL,3
"if they have to have a timeout, best would be to give 1 to either teams for each inning which they can take any time during that inning even during an over",5
Smiths hard on for opening has brought this upon RR,4
Where is specialist fielder Negi? Is he on already?,5
dugout gonna jinx tewatia just like they did the last time,5
Washi is finally being used well,4
Lol it‚Äôs Chahal lads,6
"Nah, AB is way better at IPL.",12
I honestly thought it would be a competitive match.,9
I hated Swanny in the dugout initially. He's slowly growing on me now.,5
CHAHAL IS THE MOST IMPORTANT,8
[removed],-17
Uthappa not hitting a rank full toss there,2
How is this lomror guy? Big hitter?,1
Uthappa is graduate of csk school of batting,5
Abd and Chahal should've been 42% each,3
When will RR start performing at their potential,5
"i was so excited till now that i didn't notice who came in after Samson..
i assumed Lomror was a bowler.. well.. well..",1
Adamendra Chahalampa,15
I would say Chahal and even Saini more important than Koach now.,7
Cringeworthy commentary from Bhogle and DDP,1
the heck are those votes,0
"Rajasthan team management is behaving like your average Indian who buys something expensive without having taken note of just how wasteful the expense might be.

Uthappa is struggling like nobody else. How can they have paid 3 cr for him?",2
People won‚Äôt give credit to Kohli for being unorthodox and backing his spinners but when it goes wrong they‚Äôll be the first to shit on him,59
Sharjah merchants,6
Glad that RCB management wasn't reactionary and dropped Udana and Zampa after their first game. Hope the players repay the faith.,8
Loud fake crowd noises and singles. Name a better duo.,8
The thing I hate most about this scenario is that I want Uthappa to score runs but if he does Jaiswal and Vohra will stay on the bench forever while Robbie averages 5 for the rest of the tournament off the back off a 40(40),14
"Rcb got very lucky with all three wickets to be fair haha, chopped on and two marginal catches",1
Uthappa playing a masterclass,4
"LORD Robin Uthappa's last 9 IPL innings 


Runs: 126

"So the series of Samson single digit scores started, so much for Samson > Pant lol, they don't know Pant scored the most cumulative runs since IPL 2017. And even that 2 innings come at the shortest ground of 60m boundaries!!",1
Uthappa is the Steyn of batsmen,6
Uthappa will prove himself today. It's the redemption arc,2
Call Samson what you may but he is pretty consistent at being inconsistent. I wonder where the hate is? Oh yeah screw pant for?,12
Ashshuming lol you know Deep Dasgupta is a Bengali,0
Kohli might have actually got a sense of team balance this season. Would be amazing if they had bought an Indian replacement for gurkeerat,4

Bhogle is reaching new levels of cringe. Shocking drop in quality.,1
"Smith looked way better in first two games, last game he struggled against incoming deliveries and today he got out chasing one outside off..

hope he gets his mojo back.. RR needs him to perform if they need to survive..",2
I dont understand why Smith is opening. RR middle order can be so solid with him there. Get jaiswal to open ffs.,8
If Uthappa perform good today. It will be bad for RR not for RCB.,11
Harsha acknowledging RCB fans,4
Uthappa is embarassing himself more than Dhoni these days. Dude needs to retire already.,4
That 'leg spinner to left handed batsman' cricbuzz ad actor is the ugliest man I've seen on TV in long time.,-3
I'm not ashamed to say that I'm a Virat Kohli fan boy,-1

Robin to score a 100. You heard it hear first,1
I made a policy decision to never buy Ceat again,4
Maybe an unpopular opinion but I think its a poor move to have Steve Smith opening the batting (even if it came off against KXIP). He is much better off in the middle overs where he can knock the ball around for 10 deliveries before going for boundaries.,5
Now even rajasthan is scarifying their top order for middle order to get in fight or flight mode.,4
Why are they taking a timeout?,5
Middle of the over time out? Ffs,4
Typical gully cricket vibes,7
"Adam ""get rarer"" Zampa",5

RCB actually have a very strong squad.,2
"Moeen in his own right is a good spinner, but it makes sense to play Zampa as a more attacking leggie so why not",2
I missed the fucking interview,4
RR cloned Tewatia and named it Lomror,12
Surely the Zampa experiment is over after this match? I can't see RCB wasting a foreign spot on... That,6
"RR management: let's help develop some good young Rajasthan talent. Let's buy Mahipal Lomor

Fans: great idea. While you're at it you've got some good domestic bowlers in Khaleel and Deepak Chahar. Can you buy those guys?

RR management: nah Unadkat and [Kulkarni/Anureet/Aaron/Rajpoot] are better",6

I'm starting to think that timeout was created for playing ads.,16
"I‚Äôve just noticed, Gurkeerat Mann is a terrible fielder (ik he took one catch recently but still)",5
Would've been a good T20 WC had it happened this year in Australia in long grounds,4
Bring in Dube to chuck in some pies. Can't be worse than Zampa,6

Do y'all think Moeen Ali would be better instead of Zampa?,10
"RR - meh Indian players & good overseas players

KXIP  - good Indian players & meh overseas players

RR & KXIP should merge to create a team that can make the playoffs",12
"This crowd noise is so unrealistic. Literally no crowd ever except maybe Eden Gardens 2014 would chant ""Robbie"" when Uthappa's on strike",21
Why is abd saying catch every fucking delivery.,7
RR has the best overseas combination of players and still they disappoint every season,6
That's how the middle order should keep it going when the top order gets toppled. Glad to see it happening,7
Warne would rather be sexting than watch these two bat.,11

Moeen vs Zampa debate on again,1
"Saini 4-4-0-4 incoming


edit : rip",4
Shreyas Iyer has this look that he's constantly thinking about global poverty and some morbid shit,10
I always thought Zampa would be an automatic pick in the auction thanks to his great white ball form! And how he bowled to India in both of away and home tours! Not the first time I'm noticing someone like him being unsold! Imran Tahir was often unsold until he was called in as replacement,2
"Soooooo happy to see Udana get a run in the side! 

He gives his absolute all on the cricket field, such a likeable guy.",8
Just drop Uthappa and you are set,3
How come Iyer is appearing in so many big company ads? He seems to be having more endorsements than even Rohit.,5
Mumbai had similar figures before they ended up scoring 191,11
They left Rashid Khan of that list he's only 18,4
Warnie is there only to bitch about Zampa and how he took Stoin away from him,10
India is like Germany in Football. Abundance of youth talent and an Insane first team with a shit coach.,13

Getting Stokes would solve a lot of problems for RR. He would instantly solidify the middle order while also giving you an additional option in the bowling department given that he could bowl in any phase. Tom Curran just scored a 50 I know but Stokes can also play as a finisher.,10
"Guys if we stress it enough times, they'll drop who we hate and pick someone we suggest! I've noticed RCB adhering to such patterns! Still wonder why they haven't won a cup thou?",4
is that all sand,4
"With the heat and how tired the bowlers look, the death overs are going to go for a lot",3
This is why we need Uthappa. An experienced anchor when things go shit,10

"Uthappa I even tried to diss you on r/Cricket , you just don't get better , why ?",7
Knowüëèwhenüëètoüëèretireüëè,10
Oh Robbie you fuck magnet.,2
Uthappa should enroll in that WhiteHatJr shit and restart his life as a coder or something,7
Send tewatia you cowards,3
Robbie Robbie Robbie you just had to rotate the strike üòí,5
Why do these batsmen try to hit in the first ball itself. Isn't it too predictable?,1
Uthappa hogging Jaiswal's place unfairly,6
Chahal again at the first bowl. WTF,5
Uthappa needs to be dropped,8
Uhmm Tewatia walking with ten overs left while there are two legspinners to bowl! Where have I seen this before!,3
"Uthappa is basically the less accomplished version of Dhoni right now, he should retire or RR need to replace him.",6
Never thought Uthappa will be eyeing up a Test Spot at this age.,7
Jaiswal can do Robbie's job but better,3
Drop Uthappa. Open with Yashasvi with Smith at 4,4
RR need a youngster heist like we pulled off yesterday.,6
Uthappa looks like a noble fellow,2
"Uthappa playing a middling innings on this final day of test match,. Wait it's not a test?",1
Uthappa did not hit it through the line. Can't understand why he sliced it into the sky,3
"Chahal is sensational in IPL, and every other white ball format.",4
"Playoff berths to:

RCB DC KKR MI",0
Better spinners than Chahal in T20s?,8
If only it was Kohli at long off thinks Uthappa on his long walk back.,6
"There was a time when Uthappa used to walk down the pitch and smash Brett lee for 6. Feels bad to see him like this, in pain after hitting a ball straight to a fielder.",6
Rajasthan super fan crying rn,6
To be honest no Uthappa can last long in this heat.,3
Noida fan lol,3
Oh no two leggies,2
Utthapa needs to make way for Tejaswi.,3
"We're witnessing Uthappa's end here. A slow, painful irritating end",3
Uthappa will be bought by CSK next year. CSK is like a trash bin. All the old used rusty players go in their squad.,47
[removed],6
"**10.1** Chahal to Uthappa, OUT, **holes out to long-off** and a forlorn Uthappa walks back. It's just not coming off for him. Good length ball, loopy and tossed up wide outside off. He wants to loft that over long-off but it's a half-hearted attempt. Checks it and taken well inside **70-4**

RV Uthappa c Udana b Chahal 17 (22b 1x4 0x6) SR: 77.27",3
Are we getting first 23 balls tewatia or last 8 balls tewatia,7
"Rahane be like, "" mera naseeb hi kharab hai""",8
"Alright we have waited, waited and waited but still Uthappa doesnt seem to perform, HE SHOULD RETIRE NOW and RR should have brains to drop him from squad.",3
Who are in the dugout today?,1
Lomror's batting is so village but it works lmao,2
"Parag dosent wanna face chahal there , clearly missed a run",2
Youngster fighting to save his team and senior player giving him more pressure.,3
RCB have this game in the bag,2
Just send Jofra to make Kohli panic.. and once Kohli starts to panic... it becomes so easy,5
Riyan Parag day today,1
Uthappa has been the most useless player this IPL (across teams) ...don‚Äôt think any other player has been as useless as him .,7
Anchors are useless in T20s,4
"Uthappa,dhoni,watson,DK,k.jadhav, M.vijay are done. Maybe the last season for them.",9
Uthappa Uthappa don't worry Uthappa. Kalam un thozhan Uthappa,5
"""Experience"" of players like Uthappa is very overrated",3
It's kinda cruel to make them play at 2 pm. What the hell,15
This is the partnership I wanna watch,1
Why doesn't Uthappa at least slog with full power? What is the point of this half hearted drive,8
RCB were bowled out for 70 in same ground against same opposition,12
Uthappa doesnt deserve a start unless Jaiswal shits the bed change my mind. Abject failure imo,6
Zampa is a better bowler than his figures suggests. He's bowling too full at the moment,2
"Idk why Riyan Parag's face looks like - ""phir se bat karne bhej diya bc""

Translation - ""Damn! They sent me to bat again""",8
"R. Uthappa since 2018:

Innings: 31

Runs: 666

Avg: 23.79

SR: 120.87

HS: 67

50's: 2

Edit: a number",5
RR could have easily kept Rahane and made him play in Robbie's place. Robbie was never a middle order batsman.,5
"RCB is missing that killer blow like Bumrah, Archer, Rabada. Starc would have been perfect.",9
"OMG what happens to Swann, I think he is taking a piss at it",1
Manoj Tiwari was a decent player and most of the teams have weak middle order... I wonder why no one went for him...,5
Lmao ‚Äúsomething like Chahal‚Äù,5
Tewatia Archer to smack 60 in last 3 overs,4
"RR deserve to lose if they select Robie over Jaiswal. 

Look at DC, Shaw wasn't upto the mark last year, still they have selected him over Rahane this year",10
70-4 with two 20 year olds at the grease... Dejavuüòéüòéüòé,9
I wish to be loved as much as Swanny loves that car,5
Swanny masturbating to altoz again,5
You love to see swanny orgasming over the altroz,7
Oh noooooo hide that car before Swanny..... Nvm he saw the car üòí,7
Steven Smith thinks he is too slow to play at 4 but somehow let Uthappa play at 4.,42
"Buttler

Jaiswal

Smith

Samson (can be interchanged with Smith if they get off to a flier) 

Stokes

Parag",4
I used to love watching Uthappa time the ball in his prime...,4
holy fuck look at all that sand into the horizon too,3
Slip in for Chahal lol,2
Tata should give Swann an Altros just for the memes,12
During 2016-17 I think csk and rr played a lot of test matches with each other,3
"In the cricnfo poll 90 percent are saying Chahal catch was dropped, is it really that bad?",4
"i know i am gonna get hated for saying this..

Dugout is OVERRATED...

yes there are some bad eggs in the basket but i personally enjoy the normal commentary panel more than Dugout..",5
Is Tendulkar the 3rd Umpire?,4
Jaiswal needs to be in instead of uthappa,5

did they just call chahal a hatchback üò≠,5
Lord Dube lesgo,2
this is how it will look when we finally play cricket on mars,7
"Don‚Äôt write RR off until Lord Tewatia graces us all with His performance today, praise be.",5
Kohli should bowl out Chahal and Washington now. Don't keep spin for death overs. Maybe Dube gets an over or two,2
"I know Rahane isn't a great t20 player, but they replaced him with Uthappa lmao.",20
Holy fuck look at that desert,8
"CSK, look at RR, lost 4 wickets yet have scored 70 in the first 10.",14
Who's selecting Badrinath's wardrobe,2
Sasta sam curran aa gaya guys,5
RR let Rahane go and brought Uthappa. You get what you fucking deserve.,17
Dube is here to take RR to a respectable total,2
Downvote and hate on this comment to let go of your frustration,-19
"Anyone feel like CSK is getting too much undeserved hate now?

Like they won a trophy and almost won the last one with the same squad, that's a pretty good record. Having a bad season this year isn't that big a deal.",7
This is when you can get a couple overs from Dube. Amazing Captaincy from Virat,6
"""I'm a supermodel trapped in the body of a mediocre all-rounder.""
- Dube",42
"guys it must be so fucking intimidating as a mere 20 year old to bat against a team which has Kohli, AB, Chahal",3
This is not what Dube had in mind  4 years ago when coaches said you will be outperforming Kohli in the near future,3
Another game where opposition make Dube look like prime gillespie,7
"Good captaincy by VK, chipping one with dube.",3
"Dc not playing rahane, rcb dropped steyn after 2 games, csk is making Tahir sit out I think RR should learn something from other franchises and finally bench utthapa",6
Zampa at death. I know it.,8
"I swear to god, Dube hasn't looked like that bowler who gave away 34 in an over against Taylor and Seifert! What's more he's a darn good finisher as well!",3
All next 4 batsmen can hit. Don't think things are that bad for Rajasthan,3
"Uthappa man, you yourself should ask them to let you go....it won't be of any worth  even if you play that one last inning now...

Team is losing and young talent wasted...do something !!",8
Gotta feel for the players,4
He's really timing it,3
It's time RCB will start to struggle now.,7
"inb4 tevatia 40(11), Archer 42(9)",17
Rahane is good/useful on pitches like these tbh,5
My boi Miller bossing,6
Hmmm now I am wondering what went wrong with us last season,6
"Lol at that fake halla bol chants. They dont even get chanted at their own fortress, Jaipur.",14
Playing at 2 pm in a desert... Just cruel man wtf. I find it too hot to play cricket at 2 pm even here in SG,14
Again two youngsters at strike after a failed top order. What do we have today..,6
Dugout bois should talk to Swanny about his spin rpms. He gave it a good rip!,5
Please stop this white fucking hat jr. Start sports,12
The best thing about Chahal's good form is that Kohli had been able to bowl his fifth bowler quota at the new batsmen before they settle down,4
Hope Stokes can save this team,4
When do you think they will start to accelerate?,1
Cred ads are good,3
Are RR Sharjah-track bullies now?,11
When Morris comes back they can drop Udana and Dube and get Siraj still keeping the 3 spinners.,2
Badrinath in 2020: I think Pollard's bat is at least a couple of inches longer than others.,6
"Umpires wiping sweat repeatedly from their faces, sums up the conditions.
This is brutal",6

"Is zampa over rated? 

I sometimes feel like he's not as good as we think",0
We want Archer and Tewatia,6
hi ncb i would like to report some drug addicts,5
"Anyone know which is the Cheapest Jio pack for Hotstar VIP ? I think I saw a 222 pack , can't find it rn",3
Why did people talk a lot about heat? Many teams used to play test cricket right there but not many people talk about that? Is it because of busy format,2
Zampa baby what is you doing,12
They must change the name of cred to chad. The guys who made that ad give zero fucks...,4
When's Tewatia coming in,4
"I actually like the RCB XI right now, gives me some confidence
We might have PP come in to keep, but this XI looks nice too",10
"Between chahal, rashid and zampa the one who gives nightmares to Kohli is zampa. What are these guys even on about? üôÑ",10
"Dube might get a wicket next over or get smacked - that is, if he gets one over",7

Is this time for youngsters to step up again,3
"Liverpool - reds , no league trophy , corona , no fans , champions

RCB - reds , no league trophy , corona , no fans , 5th place",22
Y'all need a cup of coffee?,7
"Is this the real life?

Is this just fantasy?

Caught in a collapse,

No escape from Dubeji 

Open your eyes,

Look up to the points table and see,

We're just a poor team, we need some sympathy,

Because I'm easy bowled, easy caught

Never high, always low,

Any way the scorecard goes.

Doesn't really matter to me, to me.


... The first time I had an idea to troll RCB and now it's not even needed. :/",58
AB saying catch it for every ball lmao,40
"Man, atleast DC team is exciting with all the young Talent. KXIP and RR always look lost to me.",4
How tf is zampa being so expensive. Our international bowlers have been pretty trash.,16
Goku>>> Whis,0
Lmaooo what an ad nazar ghati durghatna ghati,11
When will Morris become Available?,3
"Lmao this lenskart ad, 

comedy of erorrs",21
Being able to sync up BBC commentary for the IPL is an absolute dream.,11
Lenskart lmaooooo what an ad,13
What‚Äôs a good score for this pitch boys?,2
scenes if RR gets to 170 üòÇ üòÇ ü§£,21
People like Uthappa is why I want a 2nd Division IPL.They are not in contention for national team and are also not allowed to play in foreign leagues. No promotion/relegation. A good paycheck though,10
Desperate for DC vs RCB game so I can see Stoinis smashing Zampa's balls üòú,63
They can really finish above 160 from here,2
Whats the temperature on the ground?,2
It's complete nightmare watching ipl and using phone while dad watching that Fucking white hat junior ad and cursing me,26
Last 5 overs have been 5 different bowlers,9
Tom Curran between 2 twins,7
"Boring game so far tbh, but it‚Äôs a pretty nice platform for Tewatia and Archer at the death to make a good total",8
Moeen and morris in pleaaseeee,2
"Y'all got any of those???


>!wickets!<",10
"The match at Sharjah would make sense at 2 pm. This is agony for the players, middle of a desert.",8
Wanna see their death bowling.,2
35¬∞c with 58%humidity. Pretty hot!,6
Where are those lusty blows? A good lusty blow is just the ticket.,3
Dugout has become poor after this big over wicket alert bs,13
People batting for Moeen over Zampa should check Moeen's t20i numbers in last 2 years. He's been lackluster.,18
[deleted],5
Are we gonna get to 10k comments today or does people not shit on these two teams enough?,8
Zampa's best friend stoinis leaving us must have affected his spirit lmao,16
Again amazing stuff from sundar. He deserves one MoM atleast,15
I gotta say I really do like the RCB jersey,60
6 overs atleast 60 they should make,3
I have faith in Udana,1
Neither Big Over Nor Wicket,5
"Okay Guys, Anyone knows how to cyberbully?


Asking for Friend",4
Sundar has bowled well,6
Come on start hitting,2
"RR just dont have it in them, it seems.",4
What's the local time out there?,3
are they gonna go after chahal now? seems like they don't know what they are doing at this point,2
I think 147-150 is a good total to score.,10
Now start hitting . Lord Tewatia and Archer are waiting.,9
"I'm more scared of players to come - Tewatia , Jofra & Curran",8
130 max,2
Kohli should get rid of all spinners before powerplay or else it's MI innings once again.,5
"One week before we see the best team vs worst team

RCB vs CSK",6
I have a girl I've matched with on bumble. She's not pinging and only 3 hours left. Just wanted to vent as this seemed like a safe space,16
"150 will make for an entertaining chase, considering the bat first advantage thus far",2
Only UMESSSSS can save RR now,3
I really do hope Udana comes good for RCB or SL! I've seen him bat alone at 8 scoring a fifty during a collapse for SL! Just need to work on that bowling part!,4
"Ok so its clear if the team has 2 solid proven hitters, a base of around 100 at the 15th over can result in a 190 score. 

Do the RR have those?",5
We'll see at least another under20 half-centurion today for sure.,2
Hope RCB dont get these 2 out. Joffradamus will eat their crap death Bowling.,26
"RCB might be at the top of the table after this, what a year 2020",5

"A team known for giving talent it's due benched Yashasvi after a match and played Uthappa for 4 matches

Should have got in Miller today with that middle order",8
Idk if its just the way batting has been in ipl 2020 or if our bowling has actually improved,3
That had to go for 6!!,2
"Today saw a WhiteHat Jr ad on LinkedIn that they are hiring Coding Teachers with * no coding knowledge * required

Wicket alert from bad-reee.,2
"Calm your tits guys, RCB can still very well mess up a 130 run chase",11
The batting is so shit that the catches aren't even carrying.,1
isn't Qatar building fully air conditioned stadiums for World cup soccer,5
Graeme Swann is such a prick! He's single handedly ruining Dugout,-1
So what's RR gonna reach from here?,2
Snooze fest,7
What a fucking beautiful spell this has been,3
we always struggle chasing 150-160ish targets... ü•∫,6
"With Tewatia, Curran and Archer all still to come and all in decent to good form so far, the message in that time out must of been to start cracking it surely.",5
"8.8 feet!!

How does decimal work in feets?",6
Archer and tewatia can smash and should come in next,10
He's a clean striker man,1
I think it's time to start swinging the bat at everything,3
cunted pro max,2
RCB management strategy for this match: analyse all Jofra tweets from 2013 to 2015,34
"AB be like ""gotta catch em all""",23
"Today Lomror has stepped up, nice to see youngsters playing their chances",6
Good field placement!!,3

"Tewatia be like main kya karu phir.

glad they told them to start cunting shots once and for all,1
"Someone once posted stats how Samsung shits the bed after a couple of games for the rest of the tournament, I guess that's begun",8
"Construction workers in Dubai, who spend their weekdays under the sun, and play Cricket once a week on Friday, think 2 PM is not the right time to play cricket in this desert heat, but not for the IPL scheduling committee.

Looks like RCB fans are reverse jinxing today on the thread,8
"Lomror to score 150 (60) and do a spinnerooni while the DJ plays ""can you dig it suckaaaa""",6
Ganguly's acting is cringe afüò¨üò¨,7
Lomror is also 20 wtf,6
Ian Bell currently on TMS commentary and he‚Äôs already very good at it. Smooth as one of his cover drives...or as smooth as can be whilst also being a brummie.,4
How does Dube - Saini - Udana - Saini - Udana look for death?,8
Thanks for that six lomror !!,2
Is my net speed down or this thread dead?,15
It's the time to swing it away,1
Time to YEET bois,4
OK that's it now chahal getting smacked in the next over.,3
If RR gets 150+ it will be challenging for us to chase,9
"RR will do really well to hit 150+ here, and RCB should chase that fairly easily",8
"Isn't Lomror the captain of Rajasthan FC team. if so, that's great captaining a team so young",1
This just in - Ben Stokes will be joining RR's next game. Much needed for their middle order!,8
Still one zampa and chahal over left. Rcb don't learn early do they ?,1
Toughest phase for RCB has begun. The last 5 overs. Let's see how well they do.,7
Will the carnage begin,2
I think Kohli could squeeze Chahal in for the next one,6
They can still score 200 from here with the right attitude.,4

MK Lomror c Padikkal b Chahal 47 (39b 1x4 3x6) SR: 120.51",4
I thought we were seeing a revamped sanju Samson but no it's the same old shit show,5
Archer? that‚Äôs bold,5
Unleash the Arch,4
Cunning plan by RR to make ABD keep and bat in the scorching sun.,9
why you do that Lomror you were going so good should have got that 50,1
Jofra show some love ü§îüò≥,19
Chennai bois missing those youngsters now,1
I dont like the name Lamror,11
Tewatia and archer here we go,6
The Sharjah match today will be the antithesis of this match. Rishabh will go berserk,6
"Amazing innings Lomror bro, somebody replace Uthappa and Parag please.",14
BBC.,2
10 bals each for tewatia and archer,4
Lomror (and not Uthappa) showed how to anchor an innings when your top order fails.,4
Why are they saving Curran after last inning...?!,3
Kohli not standing at Long On & Off now,5
"It sounded like the commentator said ""It's the 6th one down today, for the double arse""",4
*opens twitter and searches for Jofra*,10
"Every ad break I see Virat selling all kinds of things - multivitamins, online courses, trimmers. 

Dude must be neck deep in green.",39
Chahal is a really smart bowler,15
Archer-Tewatia Should be the Narine-Lynn of IPL2020,16
Well this is what we all wanted archer and tewatia for the last four,8
"19 balls *6 = 114

115+114= 239",20
Archer be like: Fine i'll do it myself,13
Archer has been liking and retweeting tweets of fans praising his batting. ‚ù§Ô∏è,29
Now Tewatia needs to play the worst 20 balls of his life then hit 5 sixes,10
"Hello, if anyone is looking for a cricket based discord server here u go

https://discord.gg/6P5GZvK",-3
Tewatia is so chill,8
"Archer and Tewatia at the crease.

30 an over gets them 206, think that's what they'll aim for",4
What's with the Long Levers‚Ñ¢?,6
Tewatia+Archer. Can't watch this,5
Archer is so cool. Sad he is stuck in such a boring franchise,12
Batsmen to dev : wherever I go I see his face,2
Thanks Tewatia for the single. RCB would rather have LTT than Jofra sixes,8
yay chahal has the purple cap,10
Tewathia is a one  time wonder guys... That too because of the sharjha ground.,12
All eyes on Tewatia now,2
Chotu from whitehat jr is going to be beaten up when school re-opens,8
"Archer 1 from 1, come on Jof, it‚Äôs not a test match...

Ahh who am I kidding, if this were a test match he‚Äôd be out already..",7
Dude hotstar go sus?,2
"20 balls to go.... Or as they say, the *last 7 overs of The Hundred*",3
I have high fucking hopes from you tewatia,6
Bruhhhh,2
"Tewatia is a typically average journeyman cricketer who got lucky one day with Cottrell feeding him length at 120 kph, don‚Äôt keep your hopes up for a repeat guys.",0
It's time folks,6
Wtf was that shot,4
Pressure on Tewatia for standing upto standards of the pedestal he was set up to ???,3
That looked so effortless wtf,5
It's that man again,4
Archar would look great in RCB jersey.,2
Tewatiya God üòç,5

Lord has come back,1
He has picked Saini today. Dude is really into good bowlers,7
"Yo Tewatia and jofra, hit 5 sixes each and get this over with..",2
Tewatiaaaaaa,1
More of those *please*,1
"Time to jinx RCB.

I think RCB will win this.",3

"* Buttler

Tewatia is bad against spin. Good against pace. Weird,15
Is Tewatia India‚Äôs biggest role model since Sachin?????,39
Tewatia rearing to go now,3
What has astrologer jof has to say for today,9
It's so cool how form can do wonders for your belief. Tewatia has renewed confidence in his hitting abilities - and translates,15
150 looks achievable,5
"Just tuning in. Haven't kept up in a while. Is Steyn injured, or was Udana chosen over him?",6
[deleted],37
"I'm sorry but I can't keep a straight face everytime the commentator calls RR ""double Arse""",50
what a stop,7
Ab is an actual God,17
Well kept ab,6
Please get to 140 at least,2
Maybe tewatia would've been better at 5,4
Too quick for the twat,3
RR need 150 at least,2
"RCB openers need to bat long, can't let ABD come in early.",18
"Lmao what is this logic

Tom Curran scored half century last match and he is coming at no. 9 (Hopefully)",12
RR will get to 165,5
Can Saini or Zampa bat?,3
Chahal is one of the smartest cricketer. Remember he is also a great chess player.,2
RR bowling is pretty weak if you ignore Archer.,8
One bad ball in the end,5
Lord tewatia to save another day,1
All good balls by saini. But one great shot and another lucky shot,6
How to get a gf? üò≠üò≠üò≠,-19
150 seems possible with these two lads around.,7
The JofMeg!!!,1
RR needs this partnership,2
Bad finish by Saini with fine leg up.,2
That was really not that bad from Saini,2
"I love watching Jof bat. 

It‚Äôs 99% mistimed swishes but that 1% he middles is absolutely glorious.

Also that was Jofs first 4 of this tournament. Just the 7 sixes before now.",20
"Uda na.

T: Make me fly.",5
150 looks easily achievable.,2
Has Archer gotten out this series?,1
Exactly 100.00kph,4
Udana is a running spinner,6
180-190 possible,1
Lmao udana the perpetual slower ball,2
I got 484/500 in my CBSE board exams in 2013. Including a 100 in mathematics. That's why the 484 in my username,-32
Few more failure from Robin and he will be perfect for CSK,11
Uthappa and Parag took their own sweet time and scored a combined 33(40) despite RR having such good batting depth,8
Brute strength lmao,1
Big Dick SIX ARgghhhhhh!!!!!What a big daddy he is!!,0
That's my boy,1

Village/gully cricket that,7
Just RCB things,10
Ah a new lenskart ad,13
Absolute clusterfuck,11
That was one of the stupidest attempt of a run out. Udana saw Kohli and got scared like a little bitch.,39
JUST HIT THE STUMPS LOL üòÇ,11
Sometimes RCB can't help being RCB,17
"While Chahal has gone strength to strength, Kuldeep has faded away. 

Don't see him getting into the Indian LOI team",21
Bullshit,5
What the comedy of errors is that?,11
Just RCB things,15
Village AF üòÇ,13
Meme team,10
OMFG hahahhahahahahahahahaha,9
Thats some of the worst running and fielding I've ever seen,21
If Tewatia runs 2 and Archer runs 0 then they definitely deserve 1 run.,20
This IPL got everything lmao,10
Komedy,6
"IPL-0
LENSKART-1",13
Tewatia ran a double there,11
Good cricket all around.,3
Lenskart got new footage for their ad,13
Nice throw 4Head,6
"I mean why are y'all surprised

Its RCB",7
How tf is Alia Bhatt still in the ad despite all the hate bruhh on her dad and the nepotism thingy,2
Never seen a bigger cheer for a single. What shit audio sync is this,8
TEWATIA A HARYANVI FOR SURE.,8
A bowler who's not confident at hitting the stumps..,10
"Village. Absolutely Village. 

Tewatia should get at least 1 there, he literally ran 2 on his own.",8
Let's see how much comes from the last over,1
RCB moment lmao,4
Kohli gon BC someone.,9
Tewatia: how to run 2 without actually running 2,11
Royal Clownery Bangalore,6
Damn that run out attempt,4
C'mon 6666 jofra,1
What is this gully cricket shit,3
"Tewatia ran 2 runs there, Archer ran 0, so RR should be awarded 1 run as the average?",8
Plz saini don't do a Ngidi,2
Wow that chennai lenskart ad has been timed to perfection,8
So who you gonna make fun of Tewatia or R C B,6
Nice Death bowling till now,4
Archer always collects 27 in his last over,3
That was a lenskart ad right there.,5
[Maybe Udana thought Tewatia was injured /s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUulbpTDcks),1
Robbie setting the stage for a big finish by slowing the innings in the middle is not appreciated enough,4
Can't nail his yorkers. Pace is saving him.,2
Announcer: We want sex,8
160 pls,3
yeah no I don‚Äôt see us defending this,4
Saini is so good but he misses too many and they end up being full tosses,4
You have more margin for error with Yorker when you have pace.,3
Udana is a good bowler but should bowl the slower ball less,2
You are as good as your death bowling. Rcb have a death bowling star that can bail them out.,2
A quick prelude to how RCB will miss the playoffs again,5
"What was that throw from the bowler as well...run out chance? Nah, I‚Äôll just under arm it to mid off...",9
"Wtf, we want sex???",4
Yeh kya h bc,3
Oh bc,6
That was scary as hell.,5
what was THAT,5
Saini wct20 selected,16
Motherfucker decapitated our Lord,11
This is grave,3
Tewatia hit by a brick,6
Beamer !!,4
"What the hell Saini, thats the LORD",9
Oh fuck. Hope he is alright,3
Ffs,2
What's the update on bhuvi and khaleel by the way?,3
That is dangerous!! What a shitshow!,6
tewatia is doing that dhoni pose,5
This is bad,3
[deleted],9
That looked bad,8
Omfg,5
"Lord Tewatia is down

I repeat Lord Tewatia is down",8
Fuckkkkkk that's nasty,3
Wtf saini,6
Nasty,7
Injuries Premier League,9
"Hey Saini we were all joking, he is a mortal being after all",14
There will be riots todayüò°üò°,8
Ouch,3
Only Sarfraz can do that,3
Oh nooo thats brutal,7
"Collarbone injury at 140kmph.

Fuck me.",7
Straight in the chest.,2
Screw Saini for injuring the Lord,16
right in the heart,1
That was the only way to stop Immortal tevatia,11
"ABD really trying to run Archer out then? Then again, don't know why Archer started running",2
That looks dirty,2
He's literally stoning him,6
These shots are scary.,3
That was nasty,3
Damn struck his chest. Hope he is okay,3
The ball struck him on the chest,3
That must have hurt really bad.,8
That would have been a wide,1
Don‚Äôt think Saini‚Äôs landed a single Yorker all tourney.,-1
Saini trying to neutralise the Tewatia threat.,8
"First Rashid, now Tewatia 
Saini has his sights set on the wristspinners this IPL",6
That looked brutal.,10
That will be quite a bruise.,4
That's not gonna do RCB any favours on the fair play leaderboard,7
Man being a RCB it feel soo good for not getting smashed in last 5 overs,4
These balls can be dangerous,2
Tewatia after smacking the next 5 balls for 30: You should have gone for the head,8
Where did the ball hit him?,2
Blasphemous bowling against the lord!,3
You don't fuck with the Lord like that,6
Saini the kind of guy who would do that deliberately,-4
"Saini has been terrible today.  Couldn't nail a yorker.

\#CancelSaini",-4
"Jeez, Tewatia should go off

And Saini shouldn't be finishing the over, take him off",-4
"RCB couldn't get Tewatia out, so they tried to *get Tewatia out*",12
"Nasty but can't blame Saini, it was instinctive",-2
At this point every ball is a free hit,3
Saini bowling like Yardley from lagaan,3
5d chess by RCB to keep Lord Tewatia from batting,1
Ooo that was horrible looking...impressive that he managed to get hit in the chest and somehow lose his shoe...and Archer still looked to run the single.,5
This is how he punishes,4
"What a rubbish ball, what was he trying to do apart from kill him?",5
Tewatia üôèüòç,6
Bruh lmaooooooooo whatttt,7
Tewatia is sex,7
RCB gonna RCB,4
Why is there so much drama when tiwatia is around?,10
I‚Äôm cracking up right now,5
"Ah, RCB death bowling",3
Tewatia's gonna twat ya,4
He's a fucking legend,4
"Love the aggression Saini, next time aim for the nose üòú",1
This is what happens when you disrespect the lord,10
wraith of the lord,6
Apology ball from saini,9
Length ball on a free hit. Was he offering an apology for the beamer?,6
oNe mAtCH wOnDeR,7
Lethal weapon hits sixes even easier than Rohit.,6
Yeah that is some comeback then.,6
The shoe left him,4
take that u BEAMERRERRRR. All hail Daddy Tewatia,5
Cunted!,5
Lord has been awakened,6
Virgin 16 (9) Archer vs Chad 17 (9) Tewatia,6
WTF Saini....length at speed for a free hit...,3
The ball left the game,5
Man should've bowled the last one on tewatia's leg stump :(,3
Ffs we will chase 160 odd wont we,2
Take that saini. Lord tewatia always stronger then earlier,6
You never attempt to kill the Lord.,3
That‚Äôs what you get for injuring the lord,4
"He took a blow for his people in the heart, Jon Twetia",11
Oh praise the lordüôèüôèüôèüôèüôè,6
"Hope he isn't hurt much, but Tewatia bro , spotlight is what you deserve for sure !! Where were you all this while...?!",3
Beautiful death bowling again,1
"I bow to thee , Lord Tewatia. üôè",7
"If I was shot in the fucking chest 

I wouldn't even clear 30 yard circle, free hit or not",10
"Mate, how, how are you bottling this?",1
Gift from Saini for last ball,5
Saini is gone now,3
What a response,3
"I have noticed that most of Tewatia's sixes are in the mid wicket, square leg region. Teams will catch on to this quick.",6
Tewatia with a basketball move for free hit,2
Greatest anime comebacks,4
"This is why RCB is shit. Good first 15 overs, then they ruin it",10
Tewatia twatting it.,7
Should hit tewatia on the nuts next. 3 moar sixes,6
Saini isn't gonna try bowling full again.,3
Tewatia should get his chest examined in the hospital after the innings,7
Saini gave him a freebie cause he felt bad #goodguysaini,6
"You know what will be the fun?
ABD vs Jofra",1
When you start the innings beautifully and start leaking runs and make them reach a sub par score...only RCB things,1
You've angered the lord,5
The wrath of the Lord,6
"Man , how good he hits, Sharjah was small but here too...how fkin clean",4
"FFS, Tewatia has one shot and he bowls in the slot for him.",10
1 upvote and I will pass the resolution of opening with tewatia and archer in rajya sabha by voice and muting the live feed.,11
Lmao,2
ABD looks tired!! He has to come out and bat too.,6
I am no longer a RCB fan. Lord Tewatia transcends these stupid artificial divisions,10
ARghhhh Ohhhh Tewatia more more Tewatia ... Do it daddy SIX SIX,2
Hit the GOAT and he will score,7
RR have struck gold with tewatia and Archer's six hitting. And stokes will join this lineup soon.,5
RCB players have been properly baked in the sun.,6
"You try to kill Lord, Lord will kill your career.",18
Classic RCB death bowling here,6
I can‚Äôt believe we reached 150,11
Oh this is bad,3
Tewatia is class ffs,5
How small is square boundary?,0
This is golden man,1
Sex is good and all but have you watched Tewatia bat?,22
Tewatia hits sixes like stick cricket,13
This guy makes it look so easy..,5
Tewatia wtf üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•,4
God,3
Lord Tewatia is taking his sweet revenge,6
Tewatia is god,5
"Et tu, saini? :(",10
Another attempt to hit the lord,3
Fuck you RCB,4
"What a shot that was , tewatia is no one match wonder",9
Saini giveth Saini taketh,5
That was glorious.,3
Oh c'mon. You gotta admire this batting. This is just timing. Lethal weapon üëç,4
"Tandav. Bhai Tandav hai yeh.

T: Tewatia performing Shiva's dance of death",2
petition to have LORD's flair,11
That's garbage bowling!,1
Saini after first over have been totally shit,1
Saini could bowl Yorkers to Pollard and Pandya but he's shitting his pants looking at Tewatia. Can't blame him tbh,37
Again what is this bowling,3
Lord tewatia is what every man wants to be and more,6
He has taken apart Cottrell and now Saini.,3
2 no balls?,2
Tewatia managing to hit that ball over square leg for a 6 is insane,8
Saini can't land the ball and people get injured first Twetia and the Gurkheet,0
He hits them so weird as if there‚Äôs no bat speed. Must be rubber in his bat or something,12
The man has too much power.,2
Saini getting Tewatiyed,2
Lol Sanju Manju in Cricinfo youtube was saying tewatia was a one hit wonder . Won‚Äôt repeat the heroics.,3
When the Lord is angry,7
Tewatia for India's finisher next WC,4
Falta hai jayega jayega,2
Tewatia is hitting effortless sixes wtf,13
Trust RCB to throw this,3
Lol so much for Saini>Bumrah ?,2
Pooran would‚Äôve stopped it,1
Who tf said drop Saini,5
Is it me or gurkeerat always misfield??,1
When you're playing a stealth mission and accidentally reveal your location to the enemies,11
"That‚Äôs a ridiculous shot, he barely looked like he put anything into it, from waist high outside off and it‚Äôs gone for 6 behind square on leg..",16
Wrath of the Lord may take RR near 170,6
"Like always, horrible death bowling",16
Is there any other scoring shot that Tewatia can play ?,11
tewatia denying a single to archer. What a turnaround. LORD,19
Tewatia should be at 5 after this,5
Man that ball should have gone to the stands,4
This is a really good comeback from Royals. Very defendable score.,10
"I think this is the reason why we are seeing so less yorkers. Coming after a prolonged hiatus, most of the bowlers have not been able to bowl them consistently. Must have observed that in practice and hence not trying during the matches.",15
We want six,4
Dont give a six pls,5
"Honestly, didn't think even Saini would crumble to the RCB ways",6
How RR have managed to get to almost 160....,6
They really should make Tewatia play at 4/5 again. Uthappa ain‚Äôt it,14
Tewatia is just left handed Ross Taylor,9
[removed],10
"How strong are his wrists

( Õ°·µî Õú ñ Õ°·µî )",14
Let's get to 160 jofra c'mon,5
I think Parag's inning really slowed them down.,9
Saini is now in guilt for almost assassinating the lord.,30
After that wicket maiden didn't expect this,10
I'd make my only fans free for a month if koach scores 5+ today,20
Gurkeerat has got to learn to save the sixes instead of attempting heroic catches,9
RCB didn't do much wrong tbh. RR have recovered brilliantly 160 without any contribution from the top 3 is impressive,15
Petition to swap RR's middle order and lower order around seeing as the lower order seem to be better at batting,11
Come on boys should've run anyways,8
CSK getting Fair Play Award for not showing intent,28
"Wait why didn‚Äôt they run, it was the last ball in the over?",15
Beaned both the batsman!! Lol,10
Why did tewaitia say no to that single lmao,45
Best thing saini can do is INJURE JOFRA,12
AB go sleep in AC room now,20
Archer paying tribute to RCB on that last ball,15
"So we have hit fourth of all 200+ sixes , Nice.",14
Why the fuck they getting fucking creative.,3
15 runs short,2
haha ne need to imitate the lord,3
Saini the punisher,6
Saini trying to kill main batsman of RR.,17
How many times are they gonna get hit by balls?,7
"It won't be easy for RCB to score 155  in scorching heat and a slow track. On top of that, Koch is in horrible form.",11
"Twetia, Archer and Gurkheet all injured this over because of Saini",11
Uthappa is really hindering RR. They could've ended up with 165-170 if he had gotten out sooner.,11
Should have tried to run,2
We gave away 55 in the last 5 but it's still one of our better death bowling performances lol,17
Have to say - super comeback from 31-3 to 154-6,8
Smith and Samson‚Äôs scores making me gag,5
Ayy easy chase,3
Petition to change t20s to f15s so we never have to see rcb get twatted all over in the last 5 overs every game :'(,8
154 is still a great score from the position that they were in,5
How is CSK still top of Fair Play award? They can literally slap both umpires still get full points.,5
Once again SPD is like sabko batting milegi. Everybody bats in that team. Like from top to bottom.,8
I think about 10-15 under par,10
Good recovery by Saini.,7
[deleted],8
"Saini: If you can't beat them, kill them",19
Should've restricted to 140. Gonna be an interesting chase now.,15
One of these days saini will kill someone with his pace.,19
"48 in 24 balls, I don't actually mind that, seeing how they were getting smashed left and right. Working a bit on these bowlers would work wonders, is what I think.",10
Only Lord Tewatia can come back from THAT and smack two effortless sixes.,17
"48 off last 4 overs, As an Rcb fan Ill take that everytime.",36
"Angry Jofra, Nice.",7
"Ok we were being harsh, 48 off last 4 is really not bad bowling",15
I'd be a little apprehensive facing Archer today,11
Tewatia > Jadeja,14
How are CSK at the top of fairplay?,21
"Gotta agree, for some reason I love this Dream11 ad of Pandya. Somehow he fits in that role.",7
160 was a possibility,4
Saini forget one thing - You can't kill the God,11
Don't think this pitch's gonna dry up like it does during the night,4
RR is no SRH... bye bye..,4
Wtf was Saini doing? He bowled atleast 6 full tosses in the last 2 overs,13
Tewetia will protect me from corona virus. I know it.,11
Don‚Äôt let this distract you from the fact Tewatia has hit more 6s than Pollard this year,18
"Sincere Indian boyz, starting every interview with 'sir'. School ke samay se adat lagi hai. Old habits.",12
I think this total will be pretty tough for RCB to chase. They‚Äôve been on the field already so fatigue is going to be a factor too.,6
Chahal is a national treasure.,12
Now let's see how well RR bowls,6
Saini don‚Äôt got it in him yet,0
Anyone saw the latest haikyuu episode? Best sport anime for me! I wish they make a cricket anime too.,3
Close to 2 hours for 20 overs -_-,5
All Saini has is pace.... needs to work quite a lot at death bowling,0
RR need to dump uthappa. They have a deep enough batting order without him. Play Jaiswal at #4 if needed. He can't be worse than uthappa and at least a young gun will get a chance.,2
*Steve Smith who? Make way for tewatia*,2
Saini's gotta be a bit more ruthless. Should have gone for more yorkers.,5
Time for koach to chase and shine.,2

Very good chance for RCB to make playoffs with Morris in it will be a more balanced side but still need to improve death bowling. Atleast we now have a good opening pair and less pressure on Kohli and ABD.,5
"I felt so bad for Harsha a while ago. He was talking about how Kohli's run reminded him of Dean Jones and then the broadcaster decides to show the webcams at the same time, making the other commentator (DDG?) go ""DrEAm 11 FaNs EnJOyiNG froM The SAfEtY of THeIr hOmE"" obviously due to a contract they signed to make them say that when it comes up. Probably should discuss with the commos before popping to the car or the cams or the other sponsor stuff.",14
Rahul Tewatia has outbowled Parag for a while now. Out-batted him too.,2
"Devdutt Padikkal is the first player to reach 50 three times in his first four IPL innings. (Gautam Gambhir, Lendl Simmons, Shaun Marsh and Rohit Sharma scored their third 50+ IPL scores in their 5th innings.)

*Andy Zaltman*",25
This is RCB's chance to reduce that negative NRR.,15
Why would you experiment and bowl Parag at this stage? Jofra should‚Äôve come last over,5
The guy on the sound button must be having a great time with that fanfare,6
Rookie Kohli learning well from Padikkal here. Might be a good prospect for India later idk. May need to rectify his ego to be successful though.. /s,46

I was worried that I was banned from the subreddit for some reason when I tried accessing the match thread. Can't imagine my relief when it was just server failure,11

"48 from 6 overs with 9 wickets left, finishing this game is basically a formality",4
ABD has been inspiring for RCB this season. Do it for AB RCB.,1
RCB is making this game boring. Very unusual from them,6
"It's been the same story every time Padikkal's scored a 50, he scores it at a SR of 150, by the end he's too fatigued to tee off and start punishing the bowlers and ends up bringing that SR to more 130-135, you can see him struggling to even time the ball and rotate the strike.

Early days for him but if he can improve that stamina and keep going, he'll be unstoppable and no better mentor than Kohli to teach him that(also ABD the man's a freak, how is he batting and fielding in this heat at his age and doing it so well)",15
Damn nice fielding,2
RCB will be on top of the table for few hours,8
RCB clearly trying to physically hurt the Lord,6
Padi has played lot more sensibly than Uthappa for example. Robin had 3 wickets down with plenty of overs left and still he was playing everything in the air.,10

A team, or player, that can only win LOI matches/perform when the sun is up because the cricket ball does not undergo racism when juxtaposed with the void of inner darkness that consumes them at sundown 8PM. This reduction in internal guilt frees the player's mind to play better.

1 50+ score in 4 matches is a bad season for Kohli? Lmaoo that's Rohit's every season,14
2 Malayalis in the top 5 run getters,8
Strange seeing a match thread of RCB with <4k comments towards the end,13
Yeah Kohli and ABD are not gonna fail making 31 off 24,10
Oh so reddit is back. I could see posts but not load comments,24
"Uthappa is playing for kkr, just in a Rajasthan jersey",11
Crazy how England have the best t20 bowler and best ginger t20 player in the world.,16
If RCB don't play Mo this season I will fly to UAE and bitchslap Kohli myself,15
Why is RCB playing sensibly? 2020 is weird.,15

A comfortable RCB win?? That's illegal...,9
Looks like Koach has picked up the bat deep philosophy from MSD.,2
Phwoar that drive was pure sex,6
You think the game is all over? This is RCB. It is not over until it's over.,10
I remember this RCB vs SRH match from 2012 when they needed 30 from 24 with 7 wickets in hand and RCB lost that match which cost then the playoffs spot.,9
"Master of the chase, indeed. Happy to see Kohli get some runs.",6
Kohli's fitness is ridiculously good,9

This is how you play for NRR.......... And a win,9
RCB with a convincing victory. Really crazy times.,6
Just beautiful,3

Omg kuldeep dropped,10
"Generating that much pace on a slower delivery, vintage Kohli is back. RR‚Äôs biggest contribution to this tournament",4
thank you for ending my misery,11
aaaaand he is back.,5
RCB at the top and CSK at the bottom. This is peak 2020 and can only get better from here.,14
Looks like Kohli has got back to his normal-self where he can't even mistime it without it travelling to the boundary,10
"Marry me, Kholi!!",18
Off to KKR vs DC,5
"Curran had been a bit unlucky with the fielding, but he's been acting like none of the runs are because of his trash bowling.",4
Do you think RR pick Unadkat simply because they paid crores  for him and it would be too depressing to bench him,5
Is this how you increase NRR?,8
So RCB are going top of the table even though only for 4 hours,10
Quality run chase from RCB. That's how you do it.,7

Dropped catch an appropriate metaphor for how the afternoon has been for RR,8
Does wickets in hand matter more or balls remaining for NRR ?,8
Boost is the secret of Koach's energy.,10

"Perfectly constructed chase, god, how good this feels as an RCB fan",6
VK's fitness is on an elite level. A 20 year old was tired after batting just as long and Kohli the 31 year old is running 3 with absolutely hardcore energy. I'm so happy the one thing Kohli will always be known for is making the Indian team incredibly fit.,62
Running 3 of a catching possibility is just adding insult to injury.,11
Heck even koach is tired,8
Need SIX to end the innings,7
I bet Uthhapa couldnt even take 1 in that,9
All hail table toppers RCB! 2020 keeps on getting weirder,12

Smudge shouldn‚Äôt have thrown that. Even though the misfield wasn‚Äôt his fault.,2
Kohli tired?,6
Fielding disasterclass by RR,4

I don't know why I still think ABD and Koacj can get out back to back balls and we lose. PTSD I guess.,7

"This is how you maintain average strike rate, improve NRR........... And win",8
Don't worry guys rr batted out a wicket maiden. It is only fair that rcb return the favor here.,2

Paddikal, Finch, Kohli (c), AB (wk), Moeen, Dube, Morris, Sundar, Negi, Chahal, Saini 

Only major question mark on Negi but you can use Moeen and Dube to make up his overs it gets hit

But the batting lineup will have a good mix of power hitters and anchors and the bowling will have more variety. Batting up to 9 with 7 bowlers",2
