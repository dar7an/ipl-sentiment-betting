"We are all CSK fans on this cursed day

*Whistle podus sadly*",27
CSK could actually go to 4th after this match if they win by a large enough margin,4
"CSK FTW!! 

PLS!! üò≠üôè",6
r/cricket vs KXIP once again ü•∫,21
Considering csk record against Punjab probably the last team they would wanna face lol,5
Who is MS cunting in the last over chasing 20 odd runs this time,5
"I dont think we'll beat mi so i want punjab to win as they'll bring more chaos to playoffs but if we win and qualify , i dont want our team to ever play against punjab again after that disaster",7
"Unless KL performs quick today, CSK gonna win for sure. 46(41) is poor than 20(20).",9
Don‚Äôt let me down CSK. Please. I never trolled you guys I swear,4
No matter how many people defend KL. I still feel he‚Äôs lost atleast 2 matches for KXIP by batting with a low SR.,48
Go csk. Plsssssss winnnnnnnnnnnn,2
"CSK please, you can 2-0 us next year, I don't care. Just win this pls.",21
Why is r/cricket against KxiP today? If any meme team deserves to go to the playoffs it‚Äôs them. Let the team have this after 6 years of missing playoffs,9
"If Karn Sharma plays today, I got a feeling Gayle and Pooran might just end his IPL career.",5
KXIP can get 200 today if KL gets out early,3
"Heart says CSK, but I really want KXIP in the playoffs. Aaaaargh, why didn't kxip win against RR? :(",3
"Go kxip, win this

And mi plz lose to srh so rcb vs dc is a knockout match",5
should they play Gowtham instead of Hooda?,1
"God I hope Faf is fit . If not just open with Jagadeesan play Hazlewood or Tahir.

Can‚Äôt take another rmatch were Watson tuk tuks another 20 ball 15 and tanks the powerplay",1
"Gayle will get out cheaply against us. 

Probably has a odd knock here and there but generally don‚Äôt remember Gayle having much of an impact against us over the years",3
"Bit early Rahul would have started with ""RBI kehta hai""",9
"Punjab in a must win situation

Ex RCB players who moved to a different team to avoid this kind of pressure on them should be having some toxic and scary flashbacks. 

To punjab fans :

 Let me tell you how script goes 
Gayle will fail, 


KL, the most consistent batsman will go for a glory start at the beginning and get out 
Jordan : The death over specialist will give runs 10 rpo",9
Come on thala! Whistle podu,5
Pls CSK lose,3
Chennai boys. Mercy.,5
"Can someone help me know what was the NRR of RCB and DC just before their most recent match each, which they both lost?

I am asking because I remember checking KXIP‚Äôs qualification scenarios just after their previous match (against SRH) and remember concluding that not only do they need to win against CSK, but SRH must also lose their last match (against MI) for KXIP to be in the top 4. Now obviously I must have looked at NRR while doing so and found that everyone else in the (then) top 4 was ahead on NRR. So, did RCB and DC each drop below KXIP only after their most recent match?",4
So how much has Srini mama asked from Preity Zinta to throw this match?,7
Feels so weird rooting against our reserve team and rooting for rivals. I can only imagine how awful it must have felt for Pakistanis to root for India in the WC only for us to disappoint,13
"Come on Watson, it‚Äôs time for redemption",4
Expecting Gayle Storm today. Universe Boss doesn‚Äôt gets his century denied often.,12
"I kinda want KXIP to win, its kinda sad to see Gayle who‚Äôs such an icon in the league to retire without a trophy.",10
Go csk!!,3
"Kohli deserves a better team than RCB, come to CSK king",4
"CSK pls win today

üå∂Ô∏è

üå∂Ô∏è

üçã

üå∂Ô∏è

üå∂Ô∏è",22
Rooting for CSK with a lot of guilt.,5
Dhoni comes back to form today scoring 50\*(25) and CSK get Rahul and Gayle cheaply,6
Jagdeeshan to keep today and Dhoni to bowl 4 overs and dismiss Pooran and KL and giving 27 runs.,7
"RCB team is back to their ""RCB"" form and may be that's why RCB fans are supporting CSK to beat KXIP today!",6
The biggest spectacle this year in the IPL wasn‚Äôt the double super over but seeing Gayle run quick two‚Äôs.,52
"I'd be tempted to drop Maxwell to play Neesham 
 
He bowls well on these slowish tracks",3
These 2 days are not gonna be a good time for my heart.,4
Kinda supporting KXIP today. Don't even care that it could end up with Delhi getting knocked out if SRH win on Tuesday. KXIP deserve to make playoffs a hell of a lot more than we do.,8
"If CSK lose today, bottom of the table confirmed. If they win, it will boil down to the KKR vs RR game for NRR

Can we focus on this important scenario too? Everyone is concerned just about qualification smh :(",13
This is probably the last IPL game for some of our players and i'm kind of emotional now.,76
"Hey guys We have got a live chat Match thread at r ipl

KXIP bout to get revenge for that 2010 game against CSK today :/,7
"I have been looking forward to an RCB vs DC knockout since the day ABD saved RCB's ass against RR and Axar Patel smacked Jaddu for 3 sixes. Like, no, they don't deserve the top spot so easily

Now that it's finally about to happen, I really want KXIP to beat CSK and I won't mind MI losing to SRH. Just make the knockout happen",1
Very very very very unrealistic  but imagine if this league had relegation too with positions 7 and 8 getting relegated. Gosh the amount of drama,5
I was not even this nervous before my CAT exam,6
"Guys I have a feeling that Maxwell will play an innings today, he has been due for so long, would really love to see him do something for once.",12
Neesham needs to come in for Maxwell today,3
"Ngl our squad is only ok. Batting seems fine, pretty strong on paper, still top heavy and no balance. Our bowling looks weak on paper but has done ok for a while. We definitely don't ""deserve"" to win. Been pretty lucky especially with Sunrisers.",5
"KXIP gona bring hell on earth to win this, they might not even back out to injure a player in order to win.",6
Just rooting for Watson and Dhoni. Don't want KXIP to lose either,3
Imma lose my shit if money laundering scheme Maxwell plays over Neesham again today,11
I have a weird feeling that it's maxwell's day,6
"Welp, boys, I had a dream that we lost to CSK. I have a sinking feeling now that we are going to lose

I don't think we have ever won the last game to qualify. We have bottled it every time",5
Letzooooo KXIP the memes if DC/RCB get knocked out would be extraordinary,5
"I want KXIP to win for sure, but somewhere the thought that this might just be the last time we are watching Dhoni in IPL makes me a bit sad. CSK have been great rivals and Dhoni has led them so well, this isn't the ending he deserves

Edit: Dhoni said this *definitely* isn't his last game :) feels good man",9
r/cricket vs kxip,4
"CSK won toss, Congrats CSK for winning the game",8
Doesn't Dhoni like batting KXIP a lot? üëÄ,8
Fuck me lost the toss again,5
So Dhoni is playing next season,31
See Dhoni said it‚Äôs not his last game so no need to feel sad let‚Äôs go KXIP!,32
Fuck fuck fuck,4
CSK won the toss and decided to book flight tickets for KXIP,152
Google predicts CSK-44%  KXIP-56%. lets see,8
"Oh Nooooooooooo, Dhoni said he will return for CSK next year",2
"Kedar Jadhav comes back in playing XI

Makes quick 55 (25) 

Takes Gayle & Pooran's wicket while giving away 20 runs in 4 overs.

Wins the Spark of the Match Award!",12
Damnn Dhoni looks different. Like he was involved in a bar fight,7
LMAO MAXWELL IS OUT AND NEESHAM IS IN,18
MAYANK IS PLAYING,26
"No Maxwell, Neesham and Mayank in",12
Maxi's finally out,8
Dre Russ is Gonna Play todays Match ¬Ø\_( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)_/¬Ø,5
Oh great Maxi is out for Neesham and hey Mayank is also in... for Arshdeep?!!!,12
CSK is like Indian armed forces. buys soviet era shit & still makes it work,9
Fucking finally,3
KXIP batting first against CSK is bad. We are fucked.,12
Arshdeep out wtf,6
Maxi finally out.,3
Nice squad today,2
"With KXIP doing almost what CSK did in 2010, just wondering who will be their Raina-Dhoni-Badrinath this match!!",5
KXIP lose the toss :(,4
"Unlucky with the toss again, but a good starting xi. C'mon guys.",4
"Kings XI Punjab (Playing XI): KL Rahul(w/c), Mayank Agarwal, Chris Gayle, Nicholas Pooran, Mandeep Singh, James Neesham, Deepak Hooda, Chris Jordan, Murugan Ashwin, Ravi Bishnoi, Mohammed Shami",3
Bruh KXIP has bad luck,5
"Maxwell Out, Jadhav In                                                                        What is this, a crossover episode?",8
Why did they drop Arshdeep wtf,31
"CSK chasing in the last match against KXIP, what could possibly go wrong?",41
Definitely not <3,2
MC BC. In for Arshdeep????,8
"finally maxi is out?

first game for him right?",5
"Punjab going Batdeep strategy ?

Rahul / Mayank / Gayle / Puran / Mandeep/ Hooda/ Neesham / Jordan / Shami / M Ashwin / Bisnoy

Not sure that makes sense to rely on Neesham for 4 overs in a do or die match",5
We are going in with an extremely heavy batting side today and bowling looks so fuckin thin and we‚Äôre batting first ffs,9
Batdeep won't work for KXIP. Their bowling was already shit.,2
"Chennai Super Kings (Playing XI): Faf du Plessis, Ruturaj Gaikwad, Ambati Rayudu, MS Dhoni(w/c), N Jagadeesan, Ravindra Jadeja, Sam Curran, Shardul Thakur, Deepak Chahar, Lungi Ngidi, Imran Tahir",3
"Dosas for breakfast with Chutney, Podi and Sambar. Niceeeee",3
"I see a lot of people talking about the memes if either RCB or DC gets knocked out, aren't all these memes the same repetitive shit?",5
Wrong to drop Arshdeep imo,6
Not the last game of Thala üòç,2
"So KXIP have gone with a batting heavy squad today, so we should expect them to go really hard at the bowling.",5
Bruhhhhhhhh Rahul has no excuse to go at 120 today. They're fucking batting till 8 and are batting first. Cunt it from ball one.,10
"so what will be the line up with mayank back?

1. Mayank

Just need to find a good offie and bring Raina back into the fold . We are looking good for next season imo",4
"CSK- In: Faf, Tahir, Shardul. Out: Watson, Santner, Karn

KXIP-  In: Neesham, Mayank. Out: Maxwell, Arshdeep",5
Lost the toss :(((,4
"Where to find the highest quality copy of ""Mai pal do pal ka shayar hu""? Asking for a friend.",2
Why not drop Deepak Hooda for Mayank? Arshdeep has proven to be trustworthy with the death overs. Seems like a bad idea.,9
"Call me pessimistic, but I predict KL to get out early, with S/R greater than 130.",1
We're defending without Arshdeep... That is scary :(,16
Dhoni is playing next year yessss,3
"Dropping Arshdeep is a mistake,  while everyone is crediting gayle for turnaround of kxip, arshdeep too has been brilliant for them.",81
"Finally, we have managed to field our best 11 in the last match. üòÅ",2
They've dropped 2 spinners cuz Gayle and pooran. They really want to win man,26
Maxwell and Arshdeep out for Neesham and Mayank really weakens their bowling a lot. Maxwell against CSK could have slowed their batting a lot,12
"CSK will need 20 of last over

Neesham will inexplicably bowl the last over 

Dhoni will smash him and win .

Seen this script before in a different version lmao",18
"This game could go two ways:

1) The 2014 qualifier way and Punjab score 220 odd

2) The 2010 Dharamsala way where CSK snatch a last over victory",10
"As a long time RCB supporter, we need to learn something from CSK. Look at them, not dependent on any other team for their position in the league.",5
KXIP playing with 4 bowlers against the team that defeated them with 10 wickets?,6
"Neesham is definitely a good replacement for maxwell, but why remove arshdeep",10
"So Sai Kishore doesnt get any game, idk could have given him this game atleast",8
Dhoni won't retire this season as next ipl is 5 months away and csk don't have a leader to replace him.,7
"""I AIN'T FUCKING LEAVING!! "" - Dhoni",77
Neesham will get TonkEd,5
"Why is CSK trying too hard at playing XI? üò≠ Let us win, ffs. You're already out.",5
[deleted],5
CSK winning the toss and KXIP weakening their bowling. Everything seems going right for other teams.,8
"Advantage: KXIP

Put 200+ and win the game.",1
Kkr and rr can make into playoffs or at the bottom of table,2
"Watson isn't playing, interesting",4
"Okay,so no Arshdeep.

Good luck in death",3
We‚Äôve never won a game at Abu Dhabi lol,4
We went with a team meant to chase any total and ended up losing the toss. Mayank coming back is a big plus. Gotta put a 200+ total atleast to protect our weak bowling attack now.,8
"Chennai bowling looks annoyingly good with ngidi, chahar and Tahir man. Need our best Batsmen firing on all cylinders",9
Win toss and choose to bowl has been checked what the winning teams being doing for a while. So sad,5
Good thing is Mandy can bat down the order and actually be a good finisher.,10
Press F for covid,4
"Glad to see Mayank back. Surprised by no Arshdeep though. 

Even though Maxwell sucked he did bring some good leadership on the field. Gayle will be critical in filling in for that.",8
I am expecting KXIP to go all guns blazing. Either they score 200+ or we are in for an early flourish of wickets. This is gonna be good,2
[deleted],4
"240 confirmed, pinky promise.",3
"As a RCB fan I'm in dilemma.. Support KarnatakaXIP or arch rivals CSK.. But a csk win probably helps rcb cause.

I don't think ever possibly support CSK unless it's Dhoni's last match. I am gonna expect dc to do a classic DD and rcb to do a classic rcb next match",2
Every change u have made would seem moronic if u dont score 200+ now,8

Less go *KINGS*...either one (sighs),5
Cmon CSK win this for your RCB bros,0
LMAO Definitely Not is trending on Twitter with 46K tweets. Dhoni's still a brand üòå,13
Rcb and dc go in if kings lose right?,1
Kkr might drop Lockie and play Russell if he is fit,4

"Fuck Tupac, all my homies love 6-pac",3
Thala confirms he will be playing in IPL 2030.,16
Lmao imagine if Imran Tahir becomes super saiyan today,6
No way kxip r gonna defend unless they make 200+ with one opening bowler n one death bowler. Csk feeds on spinners n medium pacers.,7
oh man its 445 am here in nyc feel like sleeping but also feel like watching the game smh,5
"KL at the toss talking about his role as anchor around whom the explosive batsmen like Gayle and Pooran can accelerate. Ideal for 160 par score grounds but not for 200 score grounds. We all know he can accelerate at the end like he did against RCB but if he doesn't, then he will end up with 50(40) when the team scored 190+ and lost. To add to his woes, he can't run 2s or quick singles batting with Gayle.  

Having Mandeep at 4/5 today should help him to play a bit more freely who is good enough to drop anchor if needed.",7
Holy shit..... they dropped Maxwell,6
Dhoni staying till 2021 is not a surprise but if he decides after that also..... Well that would be surprising,5
"I think Punjab formed this batting heavy 11 hoping to chase whatever total CSK put up but since they lost the toss, this strategy could end up costing them because they might not be able to defend their total. 

Arshdeep had proven himself to be a good death bowler and Maxi had been good at bowling economically in the middle overs and neither is playing today.",7
"*Dhoni not retiring.*

Star Sports : I can milk you so much",11
Big brain Kumble shouldn't have dropped Arshdeep,6
"""Definitely Not""

Baffling to leave out Arshdeep after his good performances.,9
Gaikwad is going to unleash his 6 pack today.,5
"If CSK chase the target in 14 overs, *they finish above KXIP* in the table",7
"Arshdeep was one of the brighter stars for Kings XI in their winning run, choking teams at the death, why did they drop him for an additional batsman, especially when their bowling has been the weak link?

"Well overall CSKs campaign wasn‚Äôt  so bad this time around. Yes, by CSK standards it was but there were many games which could easily have gone their way. For eg vs DC where Jadeja bowled last over owing to an injured bravo and also dropping Dhawan twice, KKR, and the ngidi no ball over, the two dropped catches (the shardul one).

If KXIP lose this and don‚Äôt qualify I think CSK and KXIP would be on the unluckier side to have not qualified. I think RR and KKR have had few really poor games on the other hand.",8
We have finally seen the last of Shane Watson in the IPL. Rajasthan legend for sure. Won 2x MoS with them,10
"I am sure kumble and team read the pitch right, probably the reason why they dropped Arshdeep",4

Btw I just realized this could be Watson last IPL. Irrespective of how he has played this year he is an absolute legend in IPL. Two times MVP for RR iirc.,45

Hope the two games are little more interesting than yesterday.,2
Teams that have a must win game along with correcting nrr difference are better off chasing it right? Talking about RR/KKR game,2

Harsha mouthing nonsense about KXIP run rate possibly dropping in case of a close match. I used to think he was the brainy kind.,0
If KXIP win today then that would be great but I don't like the changes they made today. They only have 5 bowling options and the 5th one is Neesham. I guess they want to bat as hard as they can throughout.,4

"I don't really mind about KL,Shami and Gayle. They could still win the next season. I do want KXIP to win for Neesham. Guy deserves it for every bit of heartbreak he's gotten in the last 2 years.

He wasn't in the team until he came in that ODI series against SL and smashed a 31 run over and then with his fine form walked into the WC squad. Everyone was critical of his selection but he ended up being thier MVP with fine knocks with the bat and pairing with Boult at the death. He had to bowl the most crucial 49th over against a settled Ben Stokes. BEN FUCKING STOKES. He dummied Stokes into getting a false shot that was supposed to the the WC for them only to watch Boult, NZ's best fielder mess it up and make it a six. He had to watch the last over while Boult bowled 4 pies to end the last over in a tie. Then had to come out and bat against Archer. Guy hit Jofra for a six in the super over . Do you guys realize how hard that is. He had to watch his teammate Guptill crying on his knees. He had to hear the news of his childhood coach passing away while he was hitting that six in the super over as well.

Then that Super over against England in the T20Is. 2 super over against Ind which he had to watch from home. Then he had to sit out in the IPL while his best buddy Maxwell jab and slice his way to run aball 20s.

Ffs, Guy deserves something for going through all of this.",13
Mayank taking no prisoners.,8
Why Hooda over Arshdeep? Any wild guesses? Too much batting for KXIP now.,4
with all that sand around how to they stop it from blowing on to the grass fields,4
I hope fellow CSK fans like me are hoping for a KXIP Win. Don't want our tuk tuk team to spoil their chances,16
"Yep, this is what I was missing. Pure Aggressor upfront. Lets go Mayank !!!",11
Mayank doing his job.,6
Mayank you beauty! we missed you.,9
Mayank has Intent,3
If CSK had beaten MI then we would have had 70 possible combinations of top 4 at this stage of the tournament. Crazy!,10
"Mayank gonna take them over the line. This feels so wrong, but go KXIP!!",11
"Kxip win  would make this interesting , and can result in one of Delhi or rcb being eliminated , a punjab defeat will most probably result in both rcb and dc qualifying unless one of them dramatically shit in their last match",3
"Fantasy league C , VC??",1
Is this Sharjah?,1
Script ordered Neesham to come in and bowl so Thala can hit the winning six,3

Id not be surprised if csk bids for MAXWELL and mekes him opener,4
"Whatever happens today, very proud to see this team show spine and fighting spirit. Didn't expect to be able to support them till last match this ipl",12
3 matches out and still highest partnership,2
Hoping for KXIP win. Last time people criticized KXIP selection they won.,4
Why Arshdeep is dropped? He is performing well,2
Kxip needs to score atleast 220 to win this if Neesham is going to be used as the 5th bowler,9
While rotating on chair who the fuck makes orgasmic noises ... explain dream 11 ad,5
Cmon Sam take a hat trick against an actually good team rather than us.,2
Imagine playing with your best 11 in the last fucking match of the tournament,3
KL can‚Äôt afford tuk tuk today.,2
According to my prediction model KL will score 20(40),-1
Getting goosebumps for either one of the greatest matches or dissapointments . Go kxip .,3
"'Breaking the Net'

I have never heard of that phrase",2
Looks like MSD has confirmed 2021 IPL.,5
Why was Santner replaced? And who is thair replacing?,3
After that question from Danny...would love to watch Dhoni smack all over the park,3
Its weird watching this as an SRH fan,3
Do CSK fans still want MSD to continue playing?,1
Is it a popular opinion that Mayank has been better than KL this season because of his strike rate?,3
Did MSD just se queda CSK?,7
I think KXIP will bat very aggressively today which explains why they are playing with an extra batsman,2
"Deepak Chahar isn't at his best in this IPL.

Hopefully he will get his form back soon.",2
"KKR v RR is gonna be win toss win match, right?",4
[removed],12
"KXIP bowling looks weak today without Arshdeep and Glenn ""Specialist Bowler"" Maxwell",6
"Bruh if you have a proper pace bowler like Lungi, why not give him either the first or second over.",-2
KXIP needs to go all guns blazing,2
Give this Umpire a sudarshan chakra. It would be a mythological out when he raises his finger.,8
What is this Dream 11 anyway? Is this something like Fantasy Premier League or something entirely different?,6
Aila Sachin is umpiring,9
If kl does his anchor shit again then he is useless what's the point of scoring all season then deliberately fucking the team's chances.,9
Rahul really need to show INTENT,4
Santner cucked by selection policy at CSK.,8
This long haired umpire has a proper power lean stance. Would hate to be his back if he umpires full days of First Class cricket like that.,3
Sam wearing those glasses.... we're winning today,16
"why did they drop Maxwell for the last match, as bad as he's been he's still better than Neesham",2
KL with the most worthless orange cap ever.,25
Dhoni Vs Mr. Paschim Phatak. A staring contest. Who wants it??,18
"Don't know why everyone is on about Dhoni saying this isn't his last game. 

A while back Csk chairman did confirm Dhoni would captain csk in 2021.",9
I dont buy the 'CSK has been pummeled this season' opinion. They've lost only one more game than 4 other teams. One of those games and people would be talking about how CSK had turned it all around.,7
"Are even MI fans rooting for CSK today? Not that they need to care, they‚Äôll win IPL this year anyway, but still.",4
Why pick  3 pacers on a slow pitch ?,3
Sam Curran is the modern day Chaminda Vaas,9
Hi boys,1

Good news for RR later is that Marnus made a duck today so Smith's power bar is full,28
In before KXIP score 200 and maul CSK,3
[deleted],2
Who is here rooting for csk so that things can get more complicated ?,2
Rahul channeling his inner 'KLPD' mode,6
MSD playing IPL 2021 isnt surprising given that it's just 6months away. He can easily make some extra retirement $$,5
"Mayank 

Rahul

Gayle

Mandeep

Pooran

Neesham

Jordan

Shami

Arshdeep

Bishnoi

Ashwin

I think the current gamble of playing with only 4 specialist bowlers gonna cost them the tournament",2
"Punjab are playing 7 batsmen today.

No excuse for Rahul to play any anchor role and waste overs",3
"2019 : KXIP v CSK (final league stage match for both the teams)

KL Rahul : 71(36) 

Strike rate wasn't overrated then",6
KL ‚Äúintent‚Äù Rahul,8
Wtf was that frm kl,8
Rahul hitting a six inside the powerplay WTFFFFF,10
Flat as heck,7
"Ffs :( Anchoring started.

Edit: lol",10
WTF is this nonsense Burrrah soundtrack,12
what a shot!,6
Is it just me or does everyone feel like plucking their eyes out and shoving it in their ears when the JOSH ad comes on.,22
Rahul plz strike at 150+ today,11
The real expression is ‚ÄúThrow everything but the kitchen sink‚Äù,9
The fuck kinda 6 was that lol,4
That six made the ground look really small,17
Do CSK and KXIP always play their last games against each other? 2018 2019 2020 definitely been the case.,15
"i was about to swear KL for the slow start, redeemed himself by hitting the maximum",1
Rahul has better strike rate than Kohli this season? Yikes,6
"CSK chose to field? üòÇ

Okay, the plan is Punjab and SRH are going in.

RCB vs DC , let them decide themselves.",8
What‚Äôs a good score 180?,4
KL intent Rahul,5
" Kannaur Lokesh Rahul ""The Wall"" Sharad Dravid",5
"I'd take 630 runs @ 130SR any day of the week.

But from my #3, not my opener.",12
">KL strike rate at 125.

Sir I have to stop you right here.",10
It will be pretty funny if Thala brings his old Thala back for this game,12
Common rahul orange cap is yours play for team today,2
I prefer 55(20) Rahul today instead of 80(55),11
[deleted],10
Saying is ‚Äúthrow everything BUT the kitchen sink‚Äù means throw everything possible,1
"KXIP team looking good.

I would have Gayle come as the next batsman, before Mandeep.

You want him to face as many balls as possible.",3
[deleted],14
Remainder. KL started scoring less when Mayank was out. This shows as much attention as KL gets Mayank deserves it equally if not more.,8
Chasing has become easy in last week or so and with CSK batsmen in form we have to get 200 and bat them out of the gane,8
csk can save 14 crs by dropping jadhav and piyush.,5
yessss monkiii,1
Where's that reddit betting link? Can't find it today.,1
Mayank will win it for us today,8
That little montage showed why Rahul is a mediocre test batsman. He averages in 20s in overseas test matches,5
Anil Kumble MUST have thought about opening with Gayle & Mayank but their position on the points table doesn't allow them to take any more 'risks'.,8
Mayank is a team man. Wants to score as fast as possible.,23
We really missed Mayank in last couple games.,13
This is gonna be a 100 run partnership isn‚Äôt it,13
Why do they still use the photoshopped photo of Curran xD,4
The fake sounds guy has really improved!!,38
"Mayank hitting his stride once again straightaway, like he was never away",17
"I was supporting KXIP till today, but not now. Brain dead decision by Rahul to drop Arshdeep and Maxwell. They are playing a bowler short today",6
GTFO KLPD get in Gayle let's go bang bang,4
"If KXIP score less than 200, I will be counting on Kedar Jadhav",14
[removed],2
My guess is Paschim Patak worked as a tennis line judge before he got into cricket,2
Inb4 KXIP cross 200 and one of their bowlers shit the bed today and they have no options.,0
"Quick question. 

Can anyone confirm is the break between the two innings 10 minutes ?

Edit : Thanks everyone.  Need to run somewhere in that break just wanted to confirm.",1
Why we are playing with only four bowlers?,1
Mayank being back in just adds a whole new dimension to KXIP's batting attack,5
Mayank is the real G bruh. He's not looked rusty in even one game. Today he's batting like a dream after sitting out 3 matches. Legend.,6
"We're fucked, aren't we?",2
MPL ads are fake af,10
I think Gayle should open the batting he would have took advantage of the Powerplay even if gets out he will score some quick runs,7
"That face, that hairstyle and that name (Paschim Pathak) just don't go together",11
"My pet peeve is non-Indian commentators still not pronouncing Indian names correctly. You are earning hundreds of thousands, at least put in some effort. It is so bloody annoying to hear ""Raoool"" (personally grating too).",6
The hate for Rahul here is unreal. Imagine scoring so many runs only to get this hate.,15

Wildcard Thakur is here,1
Mayank deserves permanent spot in LOI team. But in place of who?,3
kxip attacking without giving a damn,7
Lord back in form,1
Spray Thakur,1
Where are the fielders!,3
"Fuck man, I have work to do but I can't stop watching CSK being a train wreck",2
NZ's 2019 wc campaign was quite something. Brushing aside weak opponents like afg and sl. Just about getting past against bang sa and wi. Not to forget the thumping they got from Eng and aus in the group stages. Luckily getting their league game washed out against a red hot India. Won both the tosses in semi and final. And right there in the knockouts conditions were tailor made for their bowlers. Eng deserved the whole thing a lot more but man if you fantasize getting through by the barest of margins NZ's campaign was quite something.,3
"Ok, are the scriptwriters back from vacation today?",13

KL Rahul is honestly becoming a Kings XI legend.. I don't think we have had a player like him ever in the past 12 seasons in terms of reliability.,11
Bruh.,4
Is thakur in any india squad?,2
So pitch and ground doesnt actually matter if the batsmen have intent huh,3
I want these two to open for india ‚ù§Ô∏è,3
"Alright, i will say it. If KL Rahul continues to bat with 120 SR, he shouldn't be first choice opener for T20Is
 
I mean Gayle, Pooran, Mandeep, Neesham are there behind him. What does he worry about.",3
"CSK fucking KKR, RCB, DC & RR all at once",11
"Pls csk,  do what u did to us plsss",5
As a CSK supporter since IPL inception I am supporting KXIP today. I want them to qualify and win this IPL.,9
Dhoni should say FUCK IT and open with Thakur & Jadeja today,13
Real INTENT. God save Jaddu against Gayle.,6
Am I the only one who is enjoying rahul more than kohli?,9
CSK gonna bowl slow every single ball now,2
Why fuck over 1 team when we can fuck 4 :P,40
Dropping Maxwell and arshdeep for good for nothing Neesham and Hooda is surely the most braindead decision from KXIP this season?,-4
r/cricket bullying KL to play aggressively,13
Finally some INTENT‚Ñ¢ from rahul.,6
Huge comeback match for CSK. All set to come back to India after this.,3
KL Rahul with Samson's intent would be unstoppable.,7

Do y'all prefer Shardul to Lungi as well now !!!",1

Good guy Thakur not letting CSK spoil any parties,2
Goo csk,3
Lord KL pls don't show this intent against MI in playoffs,4
"My wife just looked at the TV as they did the team lineup graphic and asked ""what's the guy with the aeroplane by his name"" and I don't know.

Any help?",6
"KXIP have batting till 7, I swear to god of Rahul plays anchor role here",3
Why do they have to show swag in an add for a shitty app to make tongue twister.,7
Just in: Thala is going to present his jersey to KL Rahul after the match and before the presentation ceremony where he announces retirement,3
Rohit sharma kyu opening krne jaa raha vo toh injured hüåö,6
I still think Gayle should open with Mayank. But I guess KL thinks with his orange cap,-1
Who is RCB supporting? I want kings to win.,0
Do any of you guys think Rohit will end up playing in the playoffs as a surprise tactic?,3
bruh how tf did Danny Morrison just pronounce ‚Äúthakur‚Äù?? mf just said ‚Äútakka‚Äù,4
Mayank is a treat to watch.,4
Thank you CSK for letting kkr out of the tourney : ),6
Will CSK get tickets for coming back or will have to stay around till the end of the tournament?,3
"The most pleasing opening partnership to watch, not only in terms of runs scored, but so easy on the eye too.",8

Wow Fleming looks absolutely thrilled,2
Just like our last match,2
"MI fans , think they will play a full strength squad against us?",3
I hope KXIP get their revenge with 10 wickets today,1
The last KXIP vs CSK match if the season is always interesting in one way or the other. Can't wait to see what happens today.,2
Wish Dhoni opens today and takes the game so deep that KXIP Runrate goes above every team in the table.,4
Why would you play Ngidi over hazlegod [Typing this after he got a wicket lmao. Pure fluke],1
Time for the multiverse boss,4
Tahir coming next over.,2
Is there any way where punjab win but don't qualify,2
"Please thala, don't give your jersey to anyone today. We need these guys in form if they make the playoffs",12
Is there any minnow bowler in this match for Gayle to bash?,5
I hope Gayle makes at least a 50 today otherwise this team won‚Äôt make a competitive score.,4
I really hate how sad Mayank looks when he gets out. Just want him to smash another daddy hundred.,12
Josh ads are peak cringe,13

Please Boss one more game. Don't fail here otherwise everything you did will count for nothing.,7
"Mayank gets out

KXIP: Oh nooooo

Gayle comes in to bat

KXIP: Anyway...",10
Dhum punjabi machade dhum punjabi bruhaaa. Whatever the fuck lmao,9
Is it just me or did MI have the best match schedule? They played one first league game and the last both,7
Typical Mayank innings if there ever was one. Flashy 20-30s,3
"prediction: Gayle Wont score more than 20 today.   
Lets see",12
Gayle 100?,2
25 something from 15 something balls is Vintage Mayank from RCB days.,18
I wanna watch Tahir bowl to Gayle. Two 40+ year olds,18
Expected a Big one from Mayank today ngl,8
Gayle with the quick singles ahaha,7
Mayank is such a selfless batsman. Gg mayank,54
Gayle is a minnow basher no wonder he was snubbed in PSL where he has to face better bowling,-3
"I cant get this image out of my head, Vijay was being pipped ahead of Ruturaj. To think if he was playing since the first game CSK were serious contenders again",11
"Punjab... Punjab... Punjab ^Burrrrraahhhh!!

Less goo,3

I just hope CSK buys Kanos in the next auction. If SRH don't retain him that is,7
"Csk need to get rid of Gayle & Pooran early.  If they want to win this game. 

Kxip might bat deep but pretty sure they wouldn't go to 180+ without a mighty contribution from these two.",5
that's a good power play score. 240 on the cards fellas,5
Tahir only runs when he gets a wicket,31
Poor Tahir,6
Tahir doesn't run the same unless he gets a wicket,17
This ipl might have done more bad for Mayank than good. He is struggling against the ball coming in after pitching at a good length. Bumrah opened him up twice like that.,9
Tahir practicing his BBL fielding before he is even at the renegades,22
"Yo, who's that umpire?",3
Ngidi bowls good leg cutters,5
How was that not a wide,-6
Jadhav is a good dancer in jio ad,13
TIL Tahir runs faster after a wicket than while chasing a bowl.,28
Sunsilk needs to sign that umpire up asap for their ads,11
I feel like KXIP v CSK and RCB v SRH are 2 pairings which always seem to happen towards end of the league stage. Every year.,21
"200 karna compulsory. If Rahul plays his typical knock, they should take his orange cap and throw it in the Arabian Sea.",27

Tahir & Jadeja vs Chris is going to be interesting. Lets hope !,4
"Watto and Bravo being picked ahead of Ngidi is why we‚Äôre at the bottom of the table. 

Then again, it was the batting bench strength that was really lacking.",7
"Hope CSK retain Chawla, Jadhav and use the RTM on Thakur.",10

200 incoming,4
Love how 'Lungisan' translates to 'Soil your lungi' in Hindi.,3

A N C H O R,6
Vintage klpd inning,6
Mayank was looking top notch and could've run away with this. The obligatory slowdown after a wicket has started now and it's costing runs,14
Thakur is such an underrated bowler,3
"Damn that delivery, whoo",4
"Shardul bowling well

What am I seeing",8
Time to settle down in the middle overs and take some singles,9
Strike rate isn't important,16
"Most runs in an IPL season for KXIP

1. Rahul - 663* (2020)

2. Rahul - 659 (2018)

3. S. Marsh - 616 (2008)

4. Rahul - 593 (2019)

5. Maxwell - 552 (2014)",29
Shardhul Bowl that Yorker often man,2
Nice one Thakurji!,1
One thing Scotty & Co. are missing in the dugout is Length balls are actually Slot balls for Gayle because of his height.,4

Punjab u have 2 choices either lose this or win the ipl,9
"On a positive note , if punjab loses now 

Kkr vs Rr will be really competitive , both of them would want to increase their nrr

Expect it to be like mi vs rr 2014 ü§û",5
I feel RR will win tonight against kkr I,6
Someone please tell if they win today he will get more matches to play for orange cap,5
"Gayle be Tahir 

Match up everyone been waiting for",3
Why tf is our last league match always against CSK,6
Looks like Dhoni got Tahir in for Gayle.,3
KL Raul,3
"Has any1 scored a century in this IPL except Rahul's 132 against RCB?

Edit: lol yes Dhawan, forgot about him coz of his two ducks , and Stokes and Mayank too",2
I hope tahir picks some wickets here,4
"
The old boy's at battle",3

Will Tahir do a Rashid and get Rahul?,6
Tahir looking like Bjorn Borg,4
Yoo stop this Punjab chant lol,2
Good so far.,4
"41 year old bowler, 41 year old batsman, 39 year old keeper",21
Oof,2
Kl Rahul has a decent record against the strongest teams :- mi and csk,4
"Ahh yes, long hair bowler vs longhair batsman with long hair umpire",11
Quick Single by Gayle is always surprising even though its getting common these days.,6
Gayle c Dhoni b Tahir might be the oldest trio in IPL ever.,67
KL and Gayle both doing tuktuk???,3
Btw can someone explain KL's celebration after scoring the century against RCB? What was he trying to do?,1
No Sam Curran slander tolerated on my watch,5
Man wtf,1
_Note: This might be last IPL game for both Tahir and Gayle_,13
"Chris playing very maturely against Tahir. Taking his time , I see....",2
I want good game instead of one sided game,3
Ridiculous?? that was orgasmic,3
Tahir went for 5 runs,2
Gayle is gonna go after the next bowler.,2
Oh Sam my dear Sam,1
Sad that this could potentially be Tahir‚Äôs last game for CSK,5
"Time to go aerial, KL. Fuck it if you lose your wicket. There's still 4 specialist batsmen left. Please fucking don't repeat the same mistake AGAIN.",7
That's a good over.,1
Screw all the drama around the match and the playoff shit. Lets just hope for a wonderful game,1
Someone get Gayle before he remembers that he can hit!,2
KL Rahul back again with 116 SR ‚ù§Ô∏è,9
Only 8 runs is last 3 overs,4
They are gonna play out Tahir,2
Ffs KL is gonna be a anchor again todayüò≠,3
One of them needs to accelerate,3
8 runs from last two overs . Good comeback after the powerplay,3
KL after Mayank gets out: Alright time for a 50 off 50.,11
"Punjab I swear after making so many changes you fucked up your game today. Just delete your club.
Win pls üò≠üò≠üò≠",6
Gayle waiting for jaddu.,3
We are playing odi,4
What is Sam Curran doing in this csk team? He is just too young for them.,4
How come Gayle started doing tuktuk? Not that it's bad rn but im pleasantly surprised,-1
Who should win for RR to be eliminated?,5
Who should I vote for in the coming elections?,-13
Shaving chest is big in India? TIL,2
I for one dont think it is gonna be Watto's end or Tahirs last game the next IPL is 6 months so they dont have any option or auction to ditch them so maybe next season would be the last,5
"Ngidi, don't let em hit ya, boy.",3
"Mayank always gets overshadowed by rahul although imo he has been way better

I have never seen a more selfless player than him",32
Wtf was that shot?,4
CSK bowling is pretty quality. We should just focus more on the win that risk going crazy and bowled out low,8
"Fucking Rahul, play faster.",11
Rahul steadying the ship ‚õµ,3
Lol we lost this match,5
That is a ripper.,3
Thank you Agent Rahul,8
Less goo kxip,2
Swann doesn't listen to a word his co-commentators say or ever allow them to finish a sentence...lol,8
What a fucking ball,6
So stupid of me to think that KL will play different game today based on his start. He went back to same tuk tuk,7
YES LUNGI,1
Why would you sweep that man,3
This was coming.,1
ise out nhi karna tha yaar.,4
Wtf rahul,2
Brilliant ball that was amazing.,5
Madarchod KL . üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠,7
KL perishes. Another 160 score?,6
Damn fuck it,5
Gone wtf,3
And Ngidi was really benched for half the fucking season lmao. The lineup rn is what they should have went with from the start,8
Holy Moly what a peach,2
Yup they're losing,4
WooHoo. One wicket to go and then I can breathe again!,5
"Horrible, horrible shot by KL.",6
"**8.3** Ngidi to Rahul, OUT, **dips under his sweep and bowls him!** Beautiful bowling from Ngidi. **62-2**

KL Rahul  b Ngidi 29 (27b 3x4 1x6) SR: 107.40",4
Lungi is too good for Karnataka lol,3
29 of 27 . Pretty poor innings when you consider they are Batdeep today,5
Doomsday alert,2
Dugout is predicting shit today. Big over... Sure for CSK,2
"LUNGI DANCE, LUNGI DANCE",6
"Now Pooran will go berserk!! Fuck me!!

Should have let him bat till 15-16 overs.",7
Punjab not winning today. Are they ?,4
"KL ""The new Thala"" Rahul",2
Ahh KLass innings from the captain,2
Another ODI innings from Rahul,2
Great ball,2
Fuck! Punjab will win,5
[We always have next year](https://i.imgur.com/1FJoB0s.jpg),5
That is why you play aggressive from the start KL. You don't always get to take it deep. And that hurts your team.,6
Gayle needs to pass on his hitting powers One For All style to someone who can also run quick 1's and 2's all day,3
This Ball reminded me of that ball bowled by Bumrah to SMarsh üòç,5
So useless. Literally almost never present when we need him. Some captain and some orange cap holder,4
What a stupid shot,2
When you are more happy with how CSK is performing than your own team. I cant even.....,6
Whistlepodu lungi dance madadakas,6
Most undeserving orange cap holder I could think of.,8
I love low tossed yorkers,4
another strike-rate-is-overrated innings comes to and end.,7
"That was a poor shot KL. Why try to sweep a slow yorker? Where's that *PLAY WITH A STRAIGHT BAT* thing ?! 

Disappointing...",8
Ngidi yeah boi.,7
Brilliant captaincy by Dhoni to use Ngidi like that,4
Welcome to one more anchoring Marvel,5
"Man, Ngidi had one bad day and CSK dropped him for Bravo. Wish they'd persisted with him",10
"Ngidi getting wickets on slower balls, to me, he seems to be bowling a lot of them.",3
Chris Gayle is best when he takes some balls to settle in,8
CSK‚Äôs 2021 preparations going well.,2
I like how us KKR fans are getting hype over wickets as if we‚Äôll beat Rajasthan lmao,5
Thala Rahul,3
"Exactly why a low SR doesn't work most of the time. You can get out before you make up for the balls you've chewed up.

Warner plays with a shittier middle order is way more aggressive (except this season) and it works.",5
 Mandeep is also playing today,1
"Feel gandu for saying this, but as a RR fan, I'm hoping for a CSK win here.  üòñ  Sorry, Punjab Pals.",-1
This Ngidi lad seems talented.,0
Ngidi melts me. What a cutie,2
That is another 29 extended to KL Rahul's orange cap lead. Strike rates are overrated.,8
[deleted],0
Vibes of that slower ball by Bumrah to Shaun Marsh in the Aus tests.,4
stat padder exposed,2
Thank you nipple man.,3
[deleted],11
KXIP has a weakened bowling today... its a disaster of a decision for such a crucial match...,8
"Though CSK are winning,I really feel bad for KXIP :(",5
Ohh lungi...only if you didnt concede 22 runs on 2 balls...this would have been our qualifying match,20
Kings bowing out today,1
"CSK: Can you blow my whistle baby, whistle baby, let me know

RR and KKR: Here we go",6
"KL Rahul in last 5 matches:

Runs: 145

Avg: 29.00

SR: 110.69",8
Still can't believe they dropped Ngidi after one awful over when hes such a wicket taker,7
This HDFC ad is actual cancer omfg,6
CSK bowling is good and young with Curran Ngidi Chahar and Thakur. The team is not as bad as people make it out to be actually,7
KL 'orange cap' Rahul,6
K LOL Rahul,8
"Ahh, well. I knew we were gonna get fucked.",3
This is the prob with KL's approach. It's only somewhat justified if he takes it deep otherwise he's wasted 20-30 odd balls.,7
Kxip gave so much hope and then disappointed us,4
"This CSK side looks so well balanced, if only they found this combination at the start of the tournament",0
"Honestly at least they have a chance of setting a decent total now with batsmen that will look to play aggressively alongside Gayle. Already played 40% of the innings at less than 8 an over. Wasn't happening for KL today, doesn't look in great hitting form.",1
"This was coming. This is what happens when you curb your natural attacking instinct for 13 games straight. You can't suddenly go back to being the glorious six hitter, not even if you're Rahul.",8
Lmao. Pooran always denies a run when Gayle is ready,4
"CSK are finding their form ü•∫ü•∫

2021 champions?",6
That's definitely out of the Bravo armory that.,2
Just watching that Pooran stance gives me a backache.,3
Pooran and Gayle. We're fucked.,6
"Despite being shit for entire season, I somehow thought Maxwell could have been to KXIP what Corey Anderson was to MI in 2014, the one match wonder, in the final league game.",4
Time for some sextillion7th power power,1
Got a feeling KL will finally start playing shots during the Australian Test series,5
KL is going to upload his innings on the TukTuk app.,2
"Pooran, box office batsman of this IPL.",3
Don't care how KL bats in IPL but I am really worried about Australia tour. We have too many accumulators in top order,4
Ngidi saying a final 'fuck you' for dropping him after '27 in 2' incident,7
lol i don't know why everyone here is hating on Rahul.. dude single handedly carried KXIP this year in most matches.. what a bunch of haters ITT lol,10
we were gonna choke in eliminator anyway,3
Swann fucking roasted KL god damn.,6
Wtf Gayle is bigger than ngidi.,3
What is the obsession among Indian players with ‚Äúplaying sensibly‚Äù? Why can‚Äôt good T20 players just be allowed to be good T20 players?,9
[deleted],-7
"Lungi is cute, NGL.",10
Play more than half of the balls from the 8 overs and get 29,3
"we have too many slow beginners - RG Sharma, S Dhawan, KL Rahul, S Gill",4
"Never felt warner should be playing differently when he was getting orange cap all those years

With rahul , nothing seems great",10
Inb4 maxwell 70(35),1
"If these 2 West Indian batsmen stick till last 5 overs, will be carnage.",3
Rahul's wicket brings more joy to KXIP than CSK.,7
Nicky P needs to mix intent with sensible shots,2
Its CSK vs Westindies for now,10
Rahul killed all the momentum,3
"10 runs from last 3 overs .

Completely choked their momentum from powerplay",7
If he was 29(20) we would have been in a much better position,1
Wish this pair could stay on crease for rest of 20 overs.,1
Good to see KXIP not being defensive and holding back Pooran,2
"KXIP SHOULD ONLY LOOSE IF RR CAN CAPITALIZE ON THEIR CHANCE

I don't want both the dark horses to get eliminated...that will be a disgrace",4
"Hm, reckon CSK might come to regret that wicket.",4
KL only has a SR of 129 even after that 132. Bruh that's Rahane level,8
Punjab is Winning this Bois. Neesham and Jordan are gonna execute the choke,5
"‚ÄúNo one thought Arshdeep should be in the team, 130 on this wicket is like 220 on a normal wicket.‚Äù 

-KL post match probably",31
"Gayle & Pooran's partnership becomes very vital now. Both attacking batsmen, one should definitely try to play smart and stick to the very end. Not seeing a good total if this doesn't happen.",9
"From giving 27runs in 2balls to here

Lungi made a great comeback",13
Rahul going to lift the Orange cap as the trophy,12
Adding a premium fast bowler with legit pace is good for your team !! Who would have thought right CSK ?,9
Come on Gayle swing,3
"If Ngidi bowled like this in that RR match, we would've been at the top rn. Fuck this, man.",7
"It's beyond me how Ngidi missed out on the games he did, unless he was injured.

He should be the first name on the sheet with Faf",10
1 BIG DICK SIX incoming,6
Nooo. Should ve let KL play till the end.,2
Dafuq is Gayle thinking? KXIP gonna lose if Gayle doesnt hit,2
"say kxip were chasing, needing 16 off of 9 when one of the openers gets out. do you send in Gayle or pooran at this point? I don't think you can't not send Gayle but pooran is almost just as explosive + can run so much quicker",7
Gayle wtf man like seriously,3
CRR 6 lmao,3
"Gayle vs Tahir in IPL

16 balls

39 runs

3 fours, 4 sixes

No dismissals

SR : 243.75",6
Is there a cap for strike rate?,6
"Well Bois it's been good, maybe we'll have better luck next year",3
"Man, our management is shit. Why the fuck didn't we let Tahir, The purple cap holder of last season? Smh.",6
Mayank had made it look so easy,2
"Can‚Äôt believe Dhoni didn‚Äôt back Ngidi

Considering how much he backs Watson,Kedar etc",6
"Come on csk, only Gayle and Gayle.jr left.",5
"Can't help but think what Gayle could do with those extra 15 odd balls in the PowerPlay. Settles earlier. Would score twice what KL usually scored this season. KL can play the flexible "" anchor"" in the middle order. PowerPlay is precious. Don't waste it",6
Sam Curran looking like that kid who is going for swimming with his mother,3
"KL Rahul gets out just like Mayank, to Ngidi

KXIP: Call an ambulance!

Pooran comes to bat

KXIP: But not for me",6
"**Opinions please!**

Should Kuldeep Yadav take a transfer request for next season's auction, for he's barely played this season for KKR?

Secondly, which IPL franchise will suit him the most?",5
Pulling out is the best theory - Swann,4
12 runs in the last 4 overs :/,6
"Nigidi, Bravo, Faf, Curran.

Perfect 4 overseas players for CSK next year. Dhoni might be CSK's weakest link next year.",4
So CSK was always a good team ....,4
Nigdi is a hack. Using slower balls all the time.,4
Hey experts is there any way both RCB and KXIP can quality for playoffs? I don't want them or us to get eliminated :),1
Can Neesham be the explosive guy? With law of averages you would wonder if it would have been Maxi's day finally today,1
what was csk seriously doing by benching Imran Tahir the rest of this reason?,3
53 in the powerplay and then 12 runs off 4 overs,3
Bruh,1
Ngidi is the best South African bowler after Makhaya Ntini,-1
[deleted],8
Bowl Jadeja you cowards,2
lmao have none of yall seen gayle bat before? even in his prime he would take some time to get set,3
"If this was the Gayle from 2-3years ago, strike rotation would be an issue right now. This year he has improved a lot.",2
How are we letting Gayle to getaway with these quick single.ffs,1
Chatra from Assam is a fan of Murali Vijay.,2
11 runs in last 4 overs. We have lost it tbh,6
"Kl Rahul is very much selfish,eh!",1
65 runs in 10 overs after getting 50 in the poweplay. What a fucking disgrace. We absolutely don't deserve to qualify.,6
KL is influencing Gayle to tuk tuk,1
Gayle is struggling or calm before the storm?,2
Mayank is literally the only selfless batsman. Fuck Rahul,4
no sixes in 15 balls? wth gayle?,2
"Wondering if dhoni doesn't say ""yours"", the bowler would let it go?",4
"Don't have any favourites, but just wanna see the epic Tahir celebration in this 2020s IPL",2
"If CSK win this, will this be the most points ever accumulated by a team that finished bottom of the table?

I don't recall a season where a team got 12 points and finished last",6
Lmao why tf is he holding two bats?,-1
Ffs not Ashish Nehra in the dugout,2
What the F is going on man? People have forgotten how to hit while batting in the first inning?,4
It must be so tough for Preity Zinta to support this useless side..,1
[deleted],4
So Punjab's out?,1
Gayle will be itching to hit out. This can be the start of brutal onslaught,1
Tf nehra doin in dugout,2
"Oh shit, Nehra in the Dugout, dis gon be gud",3
This is done man. They need at least 115 runs in the last 10 to even compete. Arshdeep is out as well. This is heartbreaking.,5
"CSK can actually build a team that can fight for the trophy next year even if let's say Raina doesnt stay 

Release Watto, Karn, Piyush we get like around 18 crores.

Aim should be to buy an Indian pacer and spinner and an overseas batsman who can tonk the ball.

Time to switch to normal commentary,2
"Absolute pathetic from KXIP. Why not open with Gayle? He is powerplay killer. KL could always play at #3. Anyways, hope they fix this issue next season.",13
12 runs in the last 4 overs after the PP. This phase is gonna be telling,5
Can't believe they are going at 6.5 rpo after the astonishing powerplay they had. Great comeback by CSK.,6

Damn! CSK won't die easily.. Punjab almost at the edge now,2
lmao classic punjab.. always failing against CSK in a must win match.. fuck this team.. they're never gonna win any championship lol,4
Chooran,3
"I think average is an incredibly damaging stat in T20s because there just isn't enough of the main resource for batsmen (balls to face) to justify one of them playing half of them if they go at a noticeably slower rate than the rest of the team, which is very possible given that big hitting and high intensity running are both very tiring and very prevalent in T20s.

There should be some weighted combination of average and strike rate (don't think just adding them like some people do is precise enough really). Something that adequately says that 26 (15) is better than 50 (39) on most pitches.",8
Kxip went self destruction mode,3
I said it before i will it again pooran is shit,1
Thakur has one of the most punchable faces. His celebrations are all cringe.,6
RIP KXIP,2
"Oh nooo!!

Pooran as well? Is the wicket too sticky or CSK are really finding their groove?",2
We donot have good bowling option to defend low total.... don't you understand Gayleüò†...we want boundaries,2

"In a Mumbai Ranji match, Shardul Thakur, known for throwing away his wicket was batting. Coach came up to him and said to play sensibly and not to go for big shots. Next ball,.Shardul hits it staright into the sky and gets caught out. The furious coach asks him what the hell he was doing, Shardul replies 'I was trying for a single'",5
Gayle showing respect to Lord Thakur by leaving the ball to the keeper üôè,4
The only reason why KXIP looses is RAHUL RAHUL RAHUL RAHUL RAHUL RAHUL RAHUL RAHUL RAHUL RAHUL RAHUL.,1
Shardul can chuck pies from time to time but he's definitely a more intelligent LOI bowler than Saini.,7
"I don‚Äôt understand one thing though. Why are they still opening with KL, the person who‚Äôs been striking at 120 and is trying to anchor? Especially when they have a historically demolishing opener in Gayle. Surely current Rahul is made for the #3 spot?",2
Universe Boss will go big!,4
"If Jadhav wasn't such a shit batsman, he would be the orange cap holder.",4
"I'd be happy with 150. Pooran should've honestly realized the pitch was hard to bat on and not swing so big. Then again we needed to up the run rate. 

Just disappointed.",5
I want a Tahir wicket pleaseee,3
How tf does the Car Dekho ad always come after a Car Ad? Is that included in their contract,1
What's the Gameplan here since Powerplay? Get to 150 and hope our 4 bowlers pull off a miracle,6
Is it just me or MS  Dhoni is slowing turning into N Srinivasan...,5
My hot take : KXIP have never won IPL when they dropped Maxi.,5
Very impressed with shardul this year.. has taken timely wickets most of the matches he got a chance..,3
Punjab losing to Chennai? Color me surprised.,5
"""*lads its Tottenham*"" to  ""*lads its KXIP*""

Things do really change quickly",7
"Dhoni doesn't have to bowl Jadeja at all with 5 bowlers all doing fairly well. If Gayle is waiting for him to start this attack, he may just keep waiting till the end",3
Harsha makes a good point. Neesham is always perfectly groomed.,8
This fucking team plays with the imotions. Get your hopes up when you have left it only to fuck it up again.,5
At least KL Rahul will get his coveted Orange cap,3
"Had posted this yesterday. Prediction 1 coming true. 


Csk will win against Kings. KKR will win against RR. DC will win against RCB. SRH will win against MI. Mi, DC - Top 2. SRH - 3 and RCB squeaks in due to better NRR than KKR. MI and SRH in finals.",2
Off topic but law of averages should catch up with Delhi  batsmen by now,2
"Pretty sure Nehra has a Thala body pillow at his home. ""Very rarely Dhoni lets a game slip away"" he said",3
[deleted],3
Gayle really targets a specific bowler to explode. I think he is respecting Tahir for now...,2
"&#x200B;

last 5 games team chasing has won the game

 RCB Vs SRH -> SRH won

DC vs MI -> MI won

KXIP vs RR -> RR won

MI vs RCB -> MI won

KKR VS CSK -> CSK won",5
Are you fucking kidding me? This team plays good now. We should be qualified rn.,1
Missed out on a juicy full toss there,0
Gayle will hit 30+ over mark my words,0
Swann is the answer,1
Just want one Tahir wicket pleaseeeeee,4
Game over bois,1
"Gayle to long haired umpire, *""Don't blush baby""*",11
Are yr bhenchod,2
Oh that‚Äôs plumb.,4
That‚Äôs the match right there bois,2
Review wasted,5
This IPL continues to showcase how you can't take any team for granted.,3
"I don't get it. If KL's trying to play a Kohli-type accumulator role, why not let a proper opener like Gayle open? He's wasting the PP and Gayle's ability to utilise the PP both at once with this approach.",9
Just realised we have pirate umpire today. Fuck yeah,3
KXIP is forked.,2
Thank you CSK best team ever,7
honestly i really feel sorry for gayle when he gets out.,3
Just wanted to see a Tahir celebration.,2
"Traffic Constable has stopped Tahir, he will shortly be taking off. Thank you for your patience",3
Plumb,3
Punjab can still come last on the points table if they lose badly,4
Lol what an absolute mess of a batting.,8
Nehra roasting Lara lmao,3
Catch that man before he leaves the bubble,9
Game over bois. Rejoice RCB fans,4
You know you spend too much time shitposting on the interwebs when Shami has a marginally higher SR,2
i am getting PTSD,2
TAHIR. PLEASE.,3
That's dead in front,1
"Punjab had one thing to do, keep csk at the bottom for once and they cannot do that too. They don't deserve to play in playoffs.",2
Ooh the pirate ump is a leftie,4
F,2
Feeling positive rn,4
Tahir gets Gayle for the 1st time in IPL,5
See ya next year bois.,2
Looks like end of season for Punjab.,6
Happy for Tahir,3
Plumb?,3
"Dafuq Gayle, lol",3
hahahaha punjab really shat the bed,3
Why was Tahir not playing all this time?,4
"Damn, that umpire has a glorious mane",7
Our plan completely backfired on us. We're gonna score low and only have 4 proper bowlers.,4
Bye Punjab. You played well. All the best for next season.,4
Hello my fellow Rajasthanis. I for one welcome our new Tamil Nadu overlords.,3
Boss didn't even consult before taking the review,1
DRS stopped Tahir's famous celebration,5
That looked plumb,3
Gayle taking DRS because he is Universal boss not because he thinks he is not out lol,8
Gone,1
Imagine if this was csk's lineup since the start,4
Chalo KXIP ko vanakkam üôèüèª,7
Show Tahir running !!! Wtf ! They didn't capture him running! Been waiting all season!,6
I personally think Pokemon HGSS is the best game in the series. Especially cuz it had both Kanto and Johto. The recent games are quite disappointing.,3
Dugout seems to have extended Saturday night's drinking session into Sunday afternoon.,3
Worst review from KXIP this season,1
Plumb.,1
Bye bye from ipl kxip,3
Perfect middle stump,2
Kings XI just wanted to prove that they were right to play the extra batsman..,5
Terrible review,2
Worst review ever. He shouldn't have been this desperate.,3
Gayle did not look comfortable at all today. The entire team seems a little out of sorts.,14
Bad review.,2
"Csk has good bowling line up,I love this.",4
Man feel for Punjab,5
Bye bye playoffs KXIP,6
Fuck Gayle should have just started swinging from the start,2
Can‚Äôt be anymore plumb.,4
Can't believe r/cricket is shitting on the Orange Cap holder of the season. r/cricket never learns,8
middle of middle lmao,2
My prediction Worked:  Gayle is out in less than 20,1
Ffs,1
"If CSK wins this, the lowest in the table ends up with 12 points, the same number was enough (with a good nrr) last year for a playoff spot. Competition this IPL is next level",11
[deleted],2
Another 100+ score today.,2
Great tahir,1
We're done here.,3
"really show how hair length=umpiring quality

ffs wtf was the umpiring last match",6
L'oreal umpire was right.,6
"he got a wicket and didnt sprint, why even get a wicket",3
"No matter how important a player you are and how much importance your wicket holds, this lbw was as middle stump plumb as possible for a spinner and you shouldn't waste a review.",4
"Gayle against other teams: Universe Boss

Gayle against CSK: Thala",7
So KXIP weren‚Äôt joking when they said that one short run will cost them their playoff spot,8
CSK even in their worst season were only a match or two away from making playoffs lol,7
CSK is doing to KXIP what MI did to CSK.,3
We are so done for yet another year . What have we as a KXIP fan done to deserve this .,3
RIP KXIP,2
What a trainwreck,3
KXIP might miss Maxwell here.,2
Clearly not the Universe Boss at taking DRS,2
Wtf was that review,2
"Battle of the 41s


Tahir V Gayle - Tahir won",5
Not even umpires call. Love paschim pathak,2
How are we playing better after getting knocked off. Fuck this man,6
Thank You KXIP. Bye Bye. See You next season.,3
"Gayle secretly telling Faf, yeah they're fucked.",7
Why the fuck would you win those 5 games and give me hope to go back to this dumb ass bullshit,4
3 collapses in 2 days. Will it be 4 now?,4
Wholesome little fistbump between Gayle and Faf there.,5
Mastermind Thala benched Tahir throughout the season,7
Wish CSK had Tahir starting instead of Chawla. Raina's loss really upset the team balance forcing the team to play Watson and Faf.,4
"Thank you CSK, very cool

-RR, KKR, SRH",7
"Sigh I thought punjab would step up, but oh well",2
This is why I keep saying that KL should play anchor throughout. This is our middle order. Y'all happy now? Keep parroting that KL is selfish,7
"Tahir did not run :(

One more wicket for the run plizz :)",3
"Sorry y‚Äôall im late, forgot it was daylight savings, woke up late",1
Not sure if KXIP is choking or CSK is playing well,2
Its the hope that kills,1
UnleashTheQuiche is going to save and carry KXIP this game,3
I'm waiting for another glorious chase from RR today.,2
"Match done, so is KXIP out of ipl?",3
"F in the chat bois .


*Sobs miserably*",2
"Bye KXIP, you had a decent run.",7
We're scary,3
CSK Cockblocked KXIP,1
"**11.5** Imran Tahir to Gayle, OUT, **that looks plumb on first viewing.** Gayle reviews this lbw, hoping it's spinning past leg stump. He's down for a sweep and struck on the knee roll, right in front of middle stump. It's definitely pitched in line. Ultra Edge confirms no bat on it. And before ball tracking is even ready, Gayle has seen enough and is walking towards the dugout...**because that is dead in front.** Pitching in line, hitting middle stump. Three reds. Tahir is pointing happily to someone in the dugout. Snuck past the sweep and now the squeeze is well and truly on **72-4**

CH Gayle lbw b Imran Tahir 12 (19b 0x4 0x6) SR: 63.15",1
Shocking how they've collapsed here. Mayank would be ruing that shot now. He was unlucky but man if he'd gotten away with that he'd have continued this innings with that momentum.,4
 This is a nice confidence boaster for next season considering that it‚Äôs only 3-4 months away,4
Is this a replay of yesterday's match ?,7
"If that clown Neesham is gonna bat below Deepak Hooda, why even pick him? Fuck you team management.",4
"There were some people who wanted Tahir's wicket for his celebration. He didn't even run, you guys happy?",7
Inb4 mandeep-hooda destroys us.,3
"Gayle 12(18) putting pressure on Pooran at the other end and eventually getting out himself

r/cricket: oh dear. Oh dear gorgeous

Kayle scores 29(27) trying to anchor  the innings

r/cricket: You fucking donkey",17
Wtf!!!!!kicking asses of top 3 and struggling with the team that is at the bottom in this IPL.,12
Minnow basher,1
Might be a blessing in disguise. Might be.,3
Did Tahir celebrate with his iconic run?,1
[deleted],11
CSK preparing for '21 trophy,6
Khatam Tata bye bye,2
"Damn, what a start this was and what a premature ejaculation.",5
"god another shit game, when does the Ind Vs Aus start, 

the IPL has petered off",4
Aww Curran and Tahir,3
Why Punjab is fucking this up !!,6
Punjab finally remembered that they're Punjab,6
I guess its time to change my flair.,6
Wow what a review,4
The heavy metal ump has actually been really good with his decisions this ipl. Much better than the rest at least,7
I wish CSK played like this one match earlier that they did.,6
[deleted],13
I feel bad for Preity Zinta,5
"Nobody:

My mom: Wicket lene ke baad Tahir jitna daudta hai utna tum roz dauda karo to bhi bahut hai",5
Cant wait to see CSK choke teams at Chepauk,4
Just wish Star Sports start their own subscription service. Hotstar quality is utter shite. I'd easily pay 1200/- per year for a sports-only service.,1
Take a wicket and run tahir run,8
"All of those people blaming KL for his SR in the previous game, this is what happens when he doesn't play the anchor. Hope they make 150 at least!",4
Is neesham a big hitter?,2
Please tell me Raina will play for csk next season,1
Throw 5 Tusharpandes and 5 Tyagis in for this guy to hit,1
"zc'mon Hooda, do a favour to your previous teams, SRH and RR",5
Why the fu k do I get my hope up every year and get this in the end.  More than fucking disappointed.,5
KXIP were 53-1 after 6 overs. What a shitshow!,11
Csk will jump to 5th place after this match lol,12
"Everyone: ""KXIP have peeked""

KXIP: ""I haven't even begun to peak. And when I do peak, you'll know.""",6
"*weeps for RCB B team*
*smiles for RCB A team*",7
"It's over, decent season, bottled as always. Unlucky with tosses, unlucky with games, then slightly lucky in other games. 7 straight losses is too much.",6
"Don't worry KXIP fans, Hooda is going to play a blinder and save you like he did many times for his former team. \*cries in SRH\*",8
Let's Go Imran!! Wheres the run?,2
"watch.tatasky.com doesn't work anymore, does it?",1
"CSK eventually going to end up just 1 win short of a playoff spot.. After their most horrible season, that is pretty decent.",8
Once a choker always a choker,5
Kayle convinced Gayle that SR is overrated.,10
"If only Ruthuraj didn't contract Corona he would have played in opening lineup, leaving one foreign spot to Tahir, we would have been so balanced.. lamentable..",13
[deleted],-7
TBH the match was set for us to be disappointed by Maxwell's innings. Damn you KL.,5
220 iS oN cArDs,8
"A Jimmy Neesham masterclass is surely isn't on the cards, is it?

Its 2020 afterall",4
I still trust Mandeep so let‚Äôs see,5
"Is KXIP doomed?

Can this middle order bat?",3
"Now we don't have to bowl Jaddu to left handers, yay!",3
They hype is over. Boring match now,2
Okay. I really wanted RR to qualify. Looks like a real possibility now with KXIP out of the way,6
KLPD,3
Imagine benching a purple cap holder and your most potent spinner for the whole season.,7
See Koach this how you are supposed to use Chahal,5
"Well, I guess we're eliminated",2
I can't stand Nehra üò´,1
Very similar to yesterdays Gurkeerat and sundar part of innings now,3
"Forget gayle, maybe maxi was their lucky charm",8
"CSK to KKR and KXIP ""We might be going down, but we are taking you down with us""",16
Gayle has a history of not able to perform against csk.,6
Isn't Hooda the guy who smashed everyone Last year for SRH ?,6
Would be hilarious it CSK finish at 6th above KXIP and RR/KKR,5
Genuine question: is that umpire man or women?,-3
"Now that we have developed that KXIP isnt going to win this, can we all just wish for a Tahir wicket for the sprint? I unironically looooove it.",3
"After KXIP loses today, and if RCB loses against DC tomorrow, ....... CSK will have won it's last 3 matches against RCB, KKR and KXIP.

And will have played a big part in knocking all 3 of them out of the playoffs.",6
KX choo choo has come to a halt,1
I don't think Tahir will play one more ipl. Good to see him bowl like this even at his age. Pity his national team haven't won a wc,8
I feel terrible for criticising KL's 110S/R approach now.,12
I'm gonna miss Swann and Styris. Sob sob,2
"Kumble knew there‚Äôll be a collapse so he played the extra Batsmen 

4D chess right there",5
"Punjab will lose today. But I predict that mandeep, Hooda and Neesham will bat well..",2
That picture would be what is put in  the dictionary next to the word 'Plumb' .  Gayle's ego is so big he didn't even consult his partner. But in fairness I don't think Mandeep  would have had the balls to tell him otherwise.,1
Dropping Jadhav and Watson really changed the look of this CSK side by miles.,5
What's the par score on this pitch?,1
"Koach to Kumble : banni boss banasankari bar alli enne hodiyona.   
T: come bro it's not for us.",6
Rcb/DC fans celebrating this match while our scriptwriter has RR chasing their target in 12/13 overs and beat rcb/dc nrr. Coming up in just 3 hrs.,7
CSK can win this now even if Jadhav is included and batted twice,4
Is the pitch slow? Can a low total be defended? Hope is a very kutti cheez,4
You don't see Gayle with a strike rate of 63 very often,3
[removed],4
"I feel so bad as a CSK fan right now. The DC match where Bravo wasn't fit and jadeja had to bowl the final over. There was no way DC would have won that match. If not for that match, CSK would still have been in contention for the playoffs.",13
Nehra ji explaining how to sweep lol,7
KXIP management is the imposter.,7
is KXIP's career over?,2
Gayle had no boundaries.,3
Never hyped for this match. KXIP's choke was written all over,8
Oh boy Neesham has to bowl 4 today. Fucking hell,10
Jimmy looks confused if he's in the team or not,9
"Calculator bois, can we make it to 5th place?",10
Gayle getting deja vu with his team choking at the business end,4
Gayle playing tuktuk? I've seen it all.,3
My goodness just 24 runs in the last 7 overs,6
KXIP hype train finally comes to an end.. lol this team is never gonna win any IPL. KXIP is like RCB's little sister.,5
RR should get in play-offs,1
CSK back to being the most disliked team by knocking out KXIP,5
"Changed flair to RR, hope they don‚Äôt let me down like KXIP.",2
[deleted],0
Why did no big company invested in this years ipl instead of dream 11. This ipl was a guarantee hit.,3
The rest of the IPL sides have come together to fool CSK into believing a major rebuild isn't needed after all.,16
I would rather have Maxwell then Hooda,2
What's up with teams batting first this weekend?,2
I don‚Äôt think poor Jagdeeshan will get the opportunity to bat even today.,9
"Looks like Neesham is absolutely angry that Mandeep, Hooda are sent ahead of him.

We can expect him to post their T20 stats on his Twitter.",17
Which team has the best nipple game this IPL?,4
Mandeep gotta bat deep,5
Last season purple cap winner picking up the first wicket in the last match for CSK this season.,9
Have a feeling Headbanger Umpire will be extremly popular if he starts an active insta account or YouTube channel,8
KXIP top used to play sensibly bcoz they knew Maxwell was useless and today they decided to drop him,7
I feel happy that Tahir got a wicket. I feel sad that Gayle got out. Perfectly balanced,7
"Sooo, who is writing KXIP sadness thread today? I have never done it, and I don't want to.",11
"I am ngl, today could have been the best day for Maxwell, *if he played*.",7
I hate how unlucky we are with tosses. 10 tosses lost. Absolutely rotten luck,6
If watson was in XI id give Punjab a chance. Faf just too good in small chases,4
Has Tahir returned to the ground?,3
Reddit man Jimmy last chance to protect yourself in IPL,3
Neesh probably saw these incredibly high amount of comments here in r/Cricket about Maxi playing and looks confused if he's actually playing today.,4
Yogi Adityanath to MSD - Aaj se tumhaara naam LSD. Only a charsi will not pick Tahir all this while.,-5
Should have played Maxwell. Law of averages says he would have scored a 100 today.,8
Bhogle: what rhymes with fist lol,4
KXIP is ignoring Nesham's presence just like my crush used to ignore mine.,10
"Kxip peeps don't fret, csk can 'tuk tuk' yall into the playoffs you never know",5
"Mayank only one who made the pitch seem easy. I think honestly we overthought it. They should've adjusted to the pitch. 

150-160 could've been a great score. Forget about NRR. Cause now we're 80 percent gonna lose. Completely eliminated.",2
Kxip trying to reverse jinx after realising batting line up of csk.,1
Who should srh be supporting?,1
"Nehra and Swann were the class clowns, and it shows.... because they enjoy each other",8
SRH's choke against KXIP made all of this possible.,3
"Ffs, kxip bottling so bad.",3
Ceat tyres lose interest in the game timeout,3
*CSK taking KKR and KXIP to grave for company*,9
"It's so typical of 2020 Dhoni that of all the oldies he has kept picking, the one he ought to have backed the most is the dude he left out.",9
Why did KXIP drop Maxwell now sticking all round the tourney?,8
Playing in UAE fucked CSK's spin dependent combination also. If we played half our matches in Chepauk we would qualify no matter how shit our batsmen were.,8
The team doesn't deserve to be in the playoffs. Can't even get the combination right even after 13 matches,2
I logged out for half an hour and... Holy fuck!,6
[removed],7
Neesham's last ball of the ipl was 6,3
"Going by the trend, who do you think will be Punjab's captain next season?",9
"Bruh I went to grab a snack and Gayle is out?! Wtf, what happened? How did he get out?",3
I feel Neesham should have been given more time to build an innings,3
Didn't Punjab lose a similar 'must win' match on the last day against Pune in 2017? Sehwag directly blamed the overseas batsmen after that iirc,6
Lmao. Ankit Rajpoot 2-19 in 4 overs. Where the fuck is that Rajpoot? And what has he done to the one with us?,2
[deleted],2
Just realised the run rate has dropped below the 6 mark. After being 48/0 after 5.1 overs. Wow.,10
I stopped supporting this shitty team since the day they couldn't even chase 1 run in 3 balls off Stoinis. Out of all the bowlers in the world fucking Marcus Stoinis.,12
Yogi Adityanath ji for 2024,-4
Guys this is just Punjab making the tournament more interesting by losing here to make the playoffs more competitive,7
Good Mandy. Nice Mandy,1
Hahahaha Scott shutting down Nehra,4
All MI had to do to qualify in 2018 was win against last placed team Delhi as they had higher NRR but they lost and got kicked out.,7
Chahar is having a real bad day today,6
RPO below 6. What a KLapse,7
Nehra wanted maxwell today. Just fuck off from dugout.,8
Shabaash mandy,1
4 boi.,1
Dugout is a hot mess right now,7
Nehra getting saved by the Altroz lmao,2
Swann is definitely getting paid by Tata Motors.,2
Nehra has so much confidence in his Brain-dead opinions,1
Someask ask Chahar to bend his back a little more and stop feeding these dollies at 12X KMPH,4
"Just realised that if Chennai would've beaten Mumbai in that Sharjah game, the playoffs race would've been even more exciting with all the teams still having a chance.",5
"That ""woahhhh"" by Swaney has to be the best one so far lmao",5
Imagine the meltdown if KXIP win this match from here on.,1
"As good as this performance has been, I'm still disappointed at CSK for robbing me of my only wish: watching the demonic pace bowling pair of Monu Kumar and KM Asif.",6
"Nobody:

Danny: I can hear it throbbing from here uwu",3
Ashish Nehra arguing in the Dugout is my favourite thing,4
Someone should shoot Nehra now. Goddamn douchebag.,8
Nehra is a moron.,6
"Yep, I am getting Altroz immediately.",3
You can hear it throbbing?!?,3
"KL getting so much flak but what is one guy supposed to do, it has to be a team effort. The whole unit also has to contribute.",5
"lmao Swanny interrupting nehra, and rightly so",3
"It's a bit unfair to blame a lot of batters. Pitches have become tired, toss plays a significant role. But you need to play with common sense to emerge victorious. Punjab today team selection is fair but they are paying dearly for the close losses early in season. They are a better side than RCB though.",2
CSK - playing with dreams of other teams in this edition of dream XI IPL,3

Oh boi would be great if we can defend this total with our boi Arshd- oh wait,7
"Just realized, no Arshdeep? wth Punjab",0
"If kxip loses this, its good for rcb and dc right? We both can live to die another day",10
We need RR in the playoffs to act as the mumbai equalizer.,10
Shut the fuck up please Nehra please,16
Swann's family being threatened by KGB.,2
Watson just being told what Nehra said in the Dugout lmao,6
Well I just turned tv on and I saw csk thrashing Punjab with spin so we really are back to the good old days,5
If KXIP can get 140-150 from here things are gonna spice up,2
Why is everyone talking about Nehra?,4
Golden Maxwell stats,1
Jeez Nehru chill.,2
Nehra about to throw a fit in dugout.,1
"If the score is less than 140, Gaikwad will eat KXIP with 70 (60)",8
"Bruh Nehra, Watson was fantastic in 2018, wtf you talking about?",9
Dugout is getting hilarious day by day lol,15
Lol Nehra stop it. People grow old and they can lose cricketing skills. Experience doesn't always means good things in T20,3
Jimmy Neesham is meditating,3
What did Nehra say?,4
so nehra is in dugout and we get deep das gupta in the hindi commentary panel. i'll take that deal.,6
Nehra want a spanking,5

CSK batting isn't great either..


Just need 140-145, we have a game on hands",4
"Ashu bhaiyya, you're a very hilarious guy, top banter when you're around, just don't talk cricket that's all",9
Csk on a winstreak once they lost all chances of qualifying,5
Hooda thrashing Chahar. Not your day mate,3
I agree with Nehra on this. Why back a player match after match only to drop him in a crunch situation. Either drop him halfway through the tournament or just don't pick him next year,10
Dugout lol scotty the close maxwell shd be in field is dugout lol,3
Neesham is meditating of how he‚Äôs going to score 50(24) today.,8
Shabaash Deepak!,1
"Nehra backing Finch and Maxi, was he invited to the wedding?",9
Chahar bruh. What bruh.,1
Harsha awkwardly navigating that conversation away of any potential mention of his own hair transplant.,8
"The fielder who is built like a tank, runs like a tank too. Who is he?",3
Who are the commentators with Harsha? I am not good at recognizing voices.,2
"OMG STFU NEHRA josh score 60 runs in 2 matches, he was better than walking wicket finch.",9
CSK fans - beware of imposter Thala fans (RR/KKR fans) :) Not all Thala praises today are genuine,3
Nehra is getting blasted what did he say?,2
Neesham clearly doesnt give a shit lmao,10
"if they had only swapped hooda with mayank that's all was required

maxwell and arshadeep should have played this important match",2
how do you get dugout commentary,1
I just realized that Hooda has an average of 15 in the IPL after 49 innings. Wow,10
Here b4 mandy and hooda cross 100 run partnership within 5 overs.,12
"142 is my prediction.

What's yours?",1
"Match ke baad kya plan hai?

CSK and KXIP- we going home boi",21
Does Nehra know that Watson scored a 100 in the final in 2018 to win it?,15
Is this the same stadium where yesterday afternoon game took place?,4
"Does KL think that by sending Neesham down the order, he'll automatically become a full-time bowler",51
[deleted],3
So Tom Curran went to RR from KKR ?,4
Nehra sounds genuinely hurt lol,2
CSK would do well if they get Punjab to below 160,3
Is Nehra a commentator?,6
Why is Nehra in the dugout? All this time I have been avoiding him by not watching the Hindi channel.,6
"Tbf, the CSK line up has been far better over the last few games. If they'd gone with something like this from the start instead of persisting with old finished cricketers, they'd probably have qualified",11
More of Nehra pls he‚Äôs so entertaining,3
Tonight 3 teams will be flying home,7
Reach 150. It'll give us a good match.,1
Nehra is being slaughtered by everyone,9
"I know some people didn't like it, but they 2018 mega auction took IPL to the next level. The last 3 seasons have been so competitive. Even the bottom teams are capable of beating top teams consistently, that's how good it's been.",36
"Chahar, Tahir, Ngidi that's 3 high end international bowlers. Then Curran is decent. 

That's probably right up there with Mumbai as best bowling attack.",4
It's the perfect CSK team with Raina/Bhajji. 2021 will be fun.,6
"Gayle : bats with sunglasses

Jaddu : bowls with sunglasses

3D bois : play with bluetooth sunglasses",6
Not even reaching 100 in 15th over playing with 2 extra batsmen is some KXIP level bullshit,20
Nehraji is surely not fun at parties.,5
Didn't really understand why to tinker with the middle order and try Neesham today in a do or die game. I know Maxwell wasn't in good form but this was a big stage and it would have been nice to have such experienced player,5
Imagine what all Nehrajee told Kohli when he was RCB coach... It would be shitshow all the way...,9
Jadeja's bowling average is higher than his batting average this season,8
Nehra taking revenge on behalf of Lara and Bangar who are always cut off by Swann.,5
It's the hope that kills you. We never win a last clutch match,3
I want to tune in to Nehraji's valuable commentary where's he on?,0
I don't like the looks of it. Punjab gonna smack us hard in the death overs.,4
Last 60 balls: 48/4,3
No more tuk tuk just swing,1
"I don't agree with what Nehra is saying, but it you're gonna back Maxwell for 13 matches, you've gotta go all the way with him. I don't think he should've been dropped today. Either drop him after 6-7 games in which he didn't perform or just back him until the end for him to come good.",9
Nehra in dugout makes me want to switch to normal feed with ads.,4
Take on the spinners wtf,1
Lol Nehraji talking out of his ass in Dugout and Styris shutting him down. Want him to repeat his opinion of yorker being a overrated ball to Lee lmao.,7
"Me: This weekend has good matches. It'll be better than last weak atleast.

All 8 teams : we don't think so",8
"Dugout just went from HIGH AS FUCK with Swann, Nehra and Styris to calm and sober with Lara, Cork, and Brett Lee",19
Csk should win the match so they can have some company on the return flight.,4
In b4 Mandeep hits a 50 and Neesham hits 20 runs in the final over  and score goes brrr.,3
"Come on Hooda and Mandeep, start swinging your bats",2
"Yesterday AB shouldn't have thrown away his wicket, he keeps doing that in every important match for RCB, he was very irresponsible yesterday.

I know this is a wrong thread, but still that's the reason why I'm watching this match.",3
So Neesham the specialist bowler today? Fuckin awesome,5
Nehra revealing why RCB sucked under his mentorship without even realising,12
Pooran needed to do what Hooda and Mandeep are doing,3
[deleted],6
Jaggu and Gaikwad need to be locked in a hotel room with Faf until they raise their fielding standards to Faf's.,5
Faf is not going to dive for dead rubber match,2
We are relying on the bowling to pull off that thing that happened against SRH not knowing that it was actually a choke by SRH not our good bowling,14
Till last year I thought Mandeep and Hooda were one and the same.,7
Can't wait for the our series down-under and the crispy 1080p50 Fox streams that come along with it!,7
"CSK chased 175 vs KKR on the same pitch, who arguably has a way better bowling attack. KXIP bowlers need a miracle here",5
"After watching the weekend matches so far, I can say advantage chasing side for RR vs KKR",4
Lmao Danny is hilarious,4
Deepak hoods 50(25) to save punjab,8
Are the losing teams gonna fly back home? I thought they all were going to stay till the finals,4
Damn Hooda didn‚Äôt expect that,4
HOODAMAN,15
Finally üëèüëè,3
Tahir - one more wicket & airplane please,8
It‚Äôs still baffling that CSK didn‚Äôt play Tahir this year. Imagine if we don‚Äôt play Rabada next year.,12
We ded.,8
Tahir's last over in the IPL probably,14
"CSK to KXIP be like ""We want company at the airport today""",13
"fuck, no tahir sprint this ipl",18
[removed],13
Tahir looks a bit like Pankaj Tripathi?,2
I just tuned in and Tahir is looking like he's aged 20 years since retirement,7
"Hooda & Mandy gonna take us to 140. Won't be enough, but ehh. Good to see fight.",6
Still think we should let go of Tahir at the end of season and buy Adil Rashid,9
So the pitch ain't bad,4
"Hooda man, you da man Danny Morrison üëå",1
"""Hooda man you da man""

- Danny Morrison üòÇüòÇüòÇ",12
Bruh that RCB hand washing ad is overly sexual ü•¥,7
I got abuses when I called Dhoni arrogant. He was too arrogant to change the team and accept he was wrong. This team looks so much better and balanced.,7
Brett Lee be like beautiful scenes of glorious emotion,4
"Maybe last ipl for tahir, watto, gayle",4
Tahir looking like Walmart Dumbledore,5
Neesham- My time has come,9
Oh damn Jaddu,4
JADEJA THAT WAS SMOOTH AS FUCK,9
43 from here gets us to 150. Let's fucking do this.,2
"He protecc

He attac

but most importantly

He Deepacc",9
My man Tahir deserves more than just a wicket this IPL but boy he got the wicket that matters. The big fish (or big shark I‚Äôd say),5
"Mandy gonee

Jaddu strikes",3
Kismat hi footi hai by god,3
Imagine CSK without Jaddu,7
KXIP speed running their way out of the playffs,7
Thank you Agent Mandeep,8
Lmao Jadeja went full thug life with those glasses lol,8
"Okay, so not even 140?",7
"KXIP is much like RCB my theory

1)Koach=KL both scoring but the day they fail both gives immense pressure because they consumed so many deliveries.

2)Top 4 fails they lose the game.

3)Tied a game with MI and won.

4)Bowling is either really good or shit.

5)Big Australian name didn't produced Miracle.

6)Spin duos doing brilliantly.

7)Has a specialist WK but still WK are KL and ABD.

8)Has Indian Middle order which is doing nothing.

Add points if I missed any!",26
I swear panjabi mc triggers me,4
Sir Jadduuuu,3
I want to see Neesham hit more 6s than Maxwell this season,3
No batdeep for Mandeep today,2
"IMHO the pitch seems alright for batting. CSK just bowled well and Punjab batted too ""sensibly""",7
üòîüòîüòî,2
There goes the man-to-bat-deep,2
"Saddest part of this match is that neither side cheers when they do something amazing (score six, take wicket etc)",2
Thank you CSK for still keeping KKR in the tournament!,2
Gooo neeshaam plis,3
Pitch easing a little?,2
Reddit boy in,3
Neesham has his chance to shut Manjrekar now let's see,3
Punjab should aim for 160+,3
Le wholesome redditor 100 has arrived,8
Shami and the two spinners would need to have an out of the world match to win this for punjab.,5
This is such a vintage performance so far. Choking teams in the middle with spin :'),7
"If Neesham can come in and give us 20-30, we'd have a respectable total at the end.",2
"man, i love jaddu so much",2
Classic CSK Chepauk Choke,4
Ravindra Jadeja is absolute chad cricketer,3
Come on Neesham stunt on these Hoes,3
"**16.2** Jadeja to Mandeep Singh, OUT, **slides onto off stump.** Short of a length and coming on with the arm. He's deep in the crease trying to whip across the line but that keeps low and is under the angled bat **108-5**

Mandeep Singh  b Jadeja 14 (15b 1x4 0x6) SR: 93.33",3
CSK setting up a classic spin ~cuckold~ chokehold here.,2
Tailor made situation for Jaddu,1
\*\*One of us\*\*,1
Can someone please explain what did nehra do?,2
Csk vs Kxip 2nd match of the season hasn't ever been good for Kxip. Has it?,2
The ball is keeping low. Shouldn't have played a cross batted shot.,3
Can the redditor pull off a good cameo today,6
I have a feeling Jimmy Neesham might score the fastest IPL 50 here,7
Neesh your time to shine mate,5
Redditor Neesham on crease,12
My man Neesham gonna blow shit up now.,2
"If Hooda scores a 50 or if KXIP win I'll ask this person I've been crushing on out.


Edit: I'm taking this as a sign to go for it, wish me well lads! I'll post a screenshot soon


Edit 2: It worked!",27
Hope Neesham doesn't play like a redditor today,2
If Neesham has seen reddit today he would get out early if he is loyal to this sub cz all of RCB DC KKR RR SRH fans are supporting csk today.,6

Jadeja needs to bat at 4 for India in ODIs. Should use him like how Bangladesh utilize Shakib,3
"Proud of Mandeep more than Gayle, Pooran and KL",8
CSK trying to get into playoffs only with NRR,6
I hope one of you nerds is running a personal project to identify all the commenters when Neesham is on the field to narrow down his alt,5

Seriously I don't understand why is he even getting a place in the playing 11??

MF can't slog, can't take a single, can't f*cking connect the bat even, doesn't even get out nor can he ball. What's the point of him being there??

3. 34(22) - SRH vs KXIP (2016)",16
"Initially when I saw team lineup. I thought why not Maxwell instead of Hooda. Maxwell can also bowl.

Gald to be proven wrong. Well done hooda. üëè",7
Other than KXIP fans who is supporting KXIP today?,2
"What a show by Hooda, it was not an easy pitch but dude was amazing, Jata da chora !!(T: boys of jats)",8
Memeing Hooda into form today üôÉ in b4 angry rants from my fellow redditors who support SRH lol,9
"Deepak Hooda really dragged KXIP to a defendable score on a rather tricky looking pitch. While KXIP do have only 4 true bowlers, CSK's batting lineup hasn't been setting the stage on fire either.

Early wicket or two (esp. Faf's) is going to make the chase a real task!  KXIP will be a comp. +ve squad and they def. have the momentum !!!",14
"Whyd they interview hooda , if punjab wins ,wont he get motm",7
really hooda?,5
"Yes they will not check a close call on no ball,but will watch reply for hours when batsmen is in by a mile. Piece of shit.",12
Who's favourites to win now? Is this a par score?,6
In a very recent tweet Punjab administration has decided to name Hooda as captain for the next season. JK.,10
"This is a good batting track, KXIP screwed up in the middle overs. Should be a comfortable chase if we have a good power play.",7
"Honesty kl has no excuse to play at this strike rate in the national team, I'd want him kicked out if he does",6
If rahul had a 27 ball 40 we could've been at 166 smh,5
RCB should have stuck with Shivam dube like how Punjab did with hooda.,11
"KXIP playing 8D chess here, this is 2020 CSK & no matter the target the required run rate will be 20+ for the last four overs.",8
"KL Rahul (c) 	29(27)


TFW you have faced 1/4 of total balls, scored less than 1/4 of total runs but are still orange cap holder because SR is overrated.",28
"CSK gonna collapse like SRH did. Yes, we gonna.",4
Dude Hooda üò≠üò≠ Where were you when SRH needed you in the middle order??,12
"What KXIP needs to do is - get Gaikwad and Faf out, and then make sure Dhoni bats till the end so they do not have to face Jadeja and Curran.",7
Fucking hell win this CSK. I'm about to miss one to the most important F1 races for you guys,0
Sam Curran will hit the winning runs,4
Pooran's knock and wicket was the worst of the game. He's very unreliable and he's my favorite player.,5
"think sunil joshi and team were trolling KL, when they drafted him into test side for australia",5
the game is poised for GOATwad to seal it with a 70(50),7
Fascist Kohli not taking Hooda to Australia fire him and sastri plms what is this attitude,11
"MS Dhoni: Definitely not

Star: I can milk you",12
Agarkar looks more and more like a Hobbit now,3
Hooda the difference between 120 and 150 for KXIP there. Gr8 innings,2
Ngidi is shit at death. People like archer and hooda smack him for sixes. Smh curran woulve done way better,3
"Star sports after Dhoni said ""definitely not"" :
I can milk you",13
How many times are they gonna show that Dhoni interview,3
Hoping Thala show Sparkling intent today. No fucking tuktuks. We're gonna choke this one.,1
"Lol, CSK/RCB/RR fans reverse jinxing here. In reality, 154 is cakewalk for CSK against KXIP's bowling.",4
Again we are talking about MSD and his retirement :facepalm:,1
So csk winning in 14 to hand over wooden spoon to KXIP for 4 hrs,0
That one clip is enough Star Sports ppl are creaming in pants,8
Everyone at the top of our lineup should be shamed except Mayank,4
Star Sports is making Dhoni' comment a bigger deal than it really is. He can go back to India and say he is done just like he did for national team.,10
Fleming looks absolutely DEAD INSIDE,8
"So, numbers: restrict CSK to 147 to have a NRR of -0.100. Ideally, have double that margin cushion. So, KXIP should really target this as a 141-run game.",3
NO WAY LMAO THE DJ IS PLAYING THE COFFIN SONG üòÇüòÇüòÇ,10
Don't think I can handle the pressure of watching the rest of the inning. Each 4 will be like a dagger through my heart. I guess I'll just go workout and see what happened later,4
Alright lads.. I think i'm gonna switch over to the F1 race in 20 mins.. and only check scores here and there.. don't think Punjab is gonna make it with 153.. if CSK shit the bed and Dhoni plays classic 10(20) innings I might switch back and watch.,3
Hooda throws a shade on players like Gurcarrot,7
Wtf bro only 2 curran overs? WHY?,5
Shouldn't be too difficult for csk I guess as they're playing only 4 pure bowlers,6
Does Paschim Pathak only do day games or what,10
People here talking about faf but Gaikwad is the real problem. His usual 70(50) will be a real problem for punjab,20
I wanna see Jaggi today. Not Dhoni.,1
Come pray here KXIP fans for 2nd innings Shami to turn up üôèüôèüôè,14
Can these guys stop kissing Thala's ass and appreciate Hooda. Like he is the reason that Punjab is still in the game,14
"This hooda's highest score for us was 34 in the years he played for us and iirc i saw him get as many chances as rashid fucking khan 

Now he decides to play like this smh",9
More SRH fans are getting worked up over Hooda than CSK fans. It is all about the jaadu ki jhappi.,11
"TBH it's good for everyone Kxip scored decent. 

CSK being CSK would have chased 120 in 19.5 overs. 

Reddit would be snoozing over the match. 

Kxip would be done with the tournament already. 

So at least this score keeps everyone active lol.",6
Need to get the openers out quickly to have any chance,5
As an SRH supporter let me tell you KXIP fans - huda plays only one such innings every season.,16
Don't care about punjab. Just want to see csk at bottom.,8
"Umps getting front leg no ball so wrong now third umpire looks at it. 

Umps meeting :  let's fuck up waist high no balls so much,  next time onwards we don't have to worry about it either.",13
Can a team win and still have their NRR decrease?,2
Why is no one questioning not bowling out Sam Curran? Stop licking Dhoni's butthole,2
CSK better chase this down. For RCBs sake. Please.,1
"If they are not 3 down by the end of PP, it's over guys",12
"Bruh I don't care about all the specifics, but the KL-Mayank is worth purely for their Kannada bromance. Really would like to see them open more often for India together.",16
"Decent score, but with Neesham bowling 4 it's not going to be easy",7
You think 153 is a par score on that pitch?,2
"Mahi bhai, sorry for all the trolling. üòî Please win this match.",12

Neesham doesn't have to bowl his full spell. Hooda can pitch in.,5
"KXIP played with one extra batsman, still made 153. In the end, Hooda was hitting the ball easily. So the pitch is definitely not slow, and good for batting. Go CSK, win this one. Need Whistle Podu.",5
Delete orange cap from IPL. I don't like it. Yep.,7
Commentators reverse-jinxing Thala by repeatedly showing he's yet to hit a 50 this season,7
"This is probably one of the best playing XIs CSK has fielded this year. This is what they should've been playing the whole time. They really shot themselves in the foot backing Jadhav, Watson etc.",15

Why are gayle and hooda's scores switched",6

"Don't understand why RCBians want CSK to win.. RCB can very well go to top 2 winning over DC tomorrow..

But KXIP impressed me a lot this season. Want MI, RCB, SRH, KXIP in playoffs.

Bamboozle everyone and give Gayle the first over,7

Hooda gauged the conditions perfectly n played accordingly ***or*** pitch has eased?",5
Looks like the short run is going to fuck us up in the end :'),5

I hate how reddit default sorts with best every fucking time. Not even smart enough to remember my last choice ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,2
Pitch looks to be on the sluggish side? Only the pacy/ misdirected ones are easy to put away. Bishnoi and Mashwin can actually make a match of this if KXIP can keep the PP score down.,1
BEAUTIFUL!!,8
Is neesham a redditor??,1
Timing and placement!!,7
Great touch rutu,5
Well well.... That should be it then.... Class batting from csk.,5
Another 10 wickets win for CSK?,6
No way csk is losing this from here,4
Front foot porn right there,8
10 wicket win incoming for yellow bois,2
Gaya match,5
Now kxip's only hopes are on Thala's tuk tuk,4
"Bye punjab I can't win with only one good wicket taking pacer , Jordan atm is good in death overs",5
Rutu has a bomb technique,6
"Maidens are overrated ~ Shami, probably",8
"KXIP back to being meme team, boys?",4
lubed that ball for FOUR. What a smooth boundaryüí¶üí¶,7
Looks like another 10 wicket victory is on its way for CSK,8
CSK making sure KXIP end at the last position,9
[deleted],0
"If I have this right, KXIP can still guarantee qualification by gaining 54 penalty runs then taking 10 wickets for no further run",6
why does this Umpire stand like that?,3
These 2 will win the match 10 wickets in hand,6
"By the time Shami is back from Australia he will have lost whatever hair is left on his head.,",11
Ok this guy's drives are Godly. Reminds me of a right handed version of Ganguly.,13
Don't @ at me but Rutu reminds me of KL :D,4
Both Batsmen are set now. It's gonna be a cakewalk. That half chance with hooda might be the only lose shot they play in a while,9
The 5 wides was the angriest I've been in a long long time,11
Lol that bounce was unlucky,3
What the fuck was that dive?,1
rammed the ball nice and straight *slurp *slurp üí¶,8
Both teams will catch flight to home tonight,10
CSK ending up 2 points short of playoff spot when they pretty much gave up few games ago would be hilarious,8
Rahul is the worst captain in this IPL. Changed his winning combination just because he lost one match smh,8
Shami ducking from that ball was better head position than Faf,0
How is CSK looking rn?,2
"I can't take this man. After fighting to get so hard to the playoffs, winning 5 in a row, beating the top teams, we now are going to choke against 7th and 8th place teams. I'm simply devastated, not even mad. I'm too emotionally invested guys, I'm so sorry it's too much.",17
Kumble the leg spinner never misses leg days,0
"I had a deja vu regarding 10 wickets win

Now my dumbass remembers that csk beat kxip by 10 wickets this season already",9
Why the hell are you not letting us win CSK :/,6
CSK players laughing on KXIP players in the flight tonight,17
"KXIP were in the exact same situation in PP, this is going to be a tight match",2
Can we have a special award for Paschim Pathak,4
Ohh yess ....Daddy Faf keep em comin!,3
"Remember how Amla scored 2 hundreds in an IPL but went unsold in the next auction, can we please do that with one of our openers next year?",2
Man if rahul had put his bowlers right they'd have a strong bowling I mean what goes through his mind lol bring neesham in then suddenly bring Jordan if and then shami after a brilliant over was made to sit a over WFT moments..,4
"I am too used to this life now

Faf take my energy („Å•ÔΩ°‚óï‚Äø‚Äø‚óïÔΩ°)„Å•,3
"It's over boys. Nice season by KXIP, coulda been a contender",5
So now we know about MS. What about Watson? Is he coming back next season?,1
CSK started IPL well and might as well finish well too,7
Overs 7 to 10 are critical. Spinners will be on.,3
So I guess this puts Kings XI out of contention,4
Gotta feel sad for Anil Kumble,0
"Sorry KXIP!!!!!  
Wish you best for next year.  


You are the reason why IPL is so thrilling this year",16
KXIP ü§ù losing final game of an IPL season,10
Shami is not a reliable T20 bowler tbh,2
Faf must be really good in bed. he looks like a sex machine.,6
Chad csk winning their first and last matches of this tournament,9
"So long, KXIP.

Thanks for the thrills.",5
It‚Äôs not yet over fam,1
"Fuck you, script writers",4
I was rooting for KXIP because who doesn't like a good underdog story but with this braindead captaincy I've become indifferent,5
KXIP looks done. Routing for RR now,6
"Lost 3 matches from a winning position early on. That short run , Maxwell's almost six. Too many moments that could have gone our way",4
"FAF and Gaikwad, please bring the required rate down to 6 runs per over. I do not trust CSK middle order with anything more than that!",3
"While I think the Kings are doing well, the Kings can strike back anytime and defeat the Kings to emerge victorious",5
Who should I support for the rest of the matches after KXIP are out?,5
Gaikwad looks solid af as a batsman.He values his wicket and will not throw his wicket away  so easily unless immense pressure to play ramp shot.,22
RR don't you fucking lose tonight.,5
"If kxip loses and rr/kkr dont win by a big enough margin, do both dc and rcb qualify?",1
Looks like it will be 4 teams on 12 points. It won't be too bad if we are finishing last on run rate.,4
"From Twitter, lmao 

>Someday Neesham's Twitter personality would take over. 

>Walking up to the batsman and asking ""how many retweets for your wicket?"".",6
Beautiful,2
Lovely batting tbh,4
"Of the teams that haven't won the ipl, the kxip future looks bad.. Dc have got new owners and good management, so they'll try to built a team from here. Rcb with the appointment of hesson and katich seem balanced.. But after this defeat the kxip magament is totally gonna fuck up the team.. Release everyone and start again from scratch for the nth tike",9
Even Bishnoi is going for runs,3
"Man, Sharman Joshi has had a long fall from his magnum opus Hello",5
Mind you kxip has taken zero wickets against csk this year...,15
I hate CSK so much haha. Feels like we always get done in by them,7
Pitch is a belter. KXIP fucked up. We don't deserve to qualify.,6
Abe nehra nahi wapis benstokes,2
Airline deciding between serving Idli/dosa or cholle bathure as they fly both of these teams back home,13
YES FAF BOI. KEEP THEM COMING,9
Last time KXIP took a CSK wicket Modi was in his first term,82
it's like the writers just doesn't want KXIP to qualifyüòî,11
Couldn't wait 1 more over to unleash Bishnoi??,9
Jesus Faf have mercy on them,12
Gaikwad vs Shaw is gonna be hot topic for years in Maharashtra,7
No I was expecting 25/3 in the PowerPlay. NotMyCSK,8

Faf pls noü•∫,1
[deleted],4
Faf be like: Aaja tera band bajaa du,6
Fuck,1
Csk playing for the NRR now lmao,3
Indian vice-captain thinks bowling the leg spinner to two well set batsmen in the powerplay is a good idea.,10
GG KXIP! It was a damn fun ride,3
Faf on fire,2
I‚Äôm sure if I tried to use Faf‚Äôs grip I wouldn‚Äôt make contact with the ball once.,2
Only Dhoni can win KXIP this match now,3
This is not CSK. This is some other team from another time line.,1
"Fap and Wad , name a better duo",2
KL Rahul will win the orange cap and everyone will say he had a great season. Anyone who has watched these games will know that he is more of a problem than a match-winner.,0
Should have waited for over 7.,1
CSK party poopers,1
"Faf is a KXIP bully

His last two scores read: 96, 87*",7
Who should I support now for the rest of the tournament? I like the look of new RR,1
Kxip yet to take csks wkt this season,7
Kumble's shocking decisions led to this state of KXIP. Good riddance by National team,0
CSK RIP-ing chances for all teams lately,3
KL has a large bulge in his pants.,5
Who's that talking in dugout now?,1
Deep Das is actually a good commentator lol,2
They missed Faf-ulous,3
CSK is a kxip bully.,8
Faf has 6 fifties in 10 innings against Punjab lmao,6
That Rahul innings looking great vs this Faf innings.,1
Rahul has a raging hard on,4
"Aight, I am going to take my dog for a walk now. If a wicket hasn't fallen by the time I am back, I am going to take a nap",5
In the end the short run made all the difference,3
Inside edge,1
"I woke up expecting Watson but got Faf instead 

*sigh*",3
What's the chance next 2 matches get canceled due to heavy rain and csk qualifies  with NRR thanks to Thala calculation‚Ñ¢?,16
Csk playing this good cuz they want to board their flight home along with kxip and reduce some costs.,3
Thank you Brett Lee for clarifying that it was a hat in his from pocket and not what I thought it was.,8
Is that a gun in KL's pocket or...?,4
"Well, that concludes KXIP's entertaining run in the tournament. I suspect we are gonna join them later in the evening.",9
Oho Shammi Oho,13
Lol looks like KL Rahul is stuffing his crotch with the Orange cap.,12
Come on KXIP we need CSK wooden spoon,0
"Can we please have Faf and Gaikwad open every single game for CSK next season without any disruptions whatsoever. 

Please and thank you.",12
Danny Morrison could be either the most funniest or most annoying. There is no in-between,5
Boot stops make me cringe,7
Lmfao India's border Gavaskar trophy chances almost ended there,22
That's so risky from Shami,12
WTF Shami,7
Bhenchod Shami we are already one bowler light for the Australian tour,6
Shami had better footwork there than prithi Shaw has shown in the entire season.,14
CSK winning this by 10 wickets would be quite the statement.,4
Village from Shami,3
Shami mf dont get injured,9
[removed],10
Ball tampering,7
"Ya Shami, go ahead fuck your ankle just before the tour to Australia.",11
Shami giving 100% percent efforts,2
WHY do I find Shami running so funny WHY,5
[deleted],5
Need Punjab to win somehow to make the coming matches more interesting,2
"Wtf I didn't shift from normal to dugout to see ""length ball"" dude",11
Who else wants to quit cricket guys?,5
"Shami boy, please don't do that and give us heart attack. We already lost Ishant and can't afford to lose you too for Australia.",9
Boot stops along with pre-match football should be banned,8
"Please don't risk the whole India Australia series because of 2 runs. FFS, we already lost Bhuvi and might not have Ishant",6
"Shami shouldn't take this risks, he is very important to the tests",7
I don't think Lara likes to see Nehra in the dugout,8
anyone else noticed that KL has a boner (or just a big guard)?,6
CSK getting love from many teams today,9
Dont worry Punjab . You can hop on our flight to return home and can cut travel costs.,7
Should be Illegal to stand on the ball,4
"So if KXIP lose, both DC and RCB pretty much qualify unless any one of the teams tonight win by an absolute monster of a margin or one of the two lose equally big tomorrow, right?",5
Stopping the ball with the fielder's boot should be considered ball tampering imo,4
Can‚Äôt they at least make that orange cap transparent,3
OOF CSK HAD WE WON JUST ONE MORE FUCKING MATCH,12
KXIP still haven't taken a wicket against CSK this IPL.,12
The spiked ball may serve an undue advatage to the bowlers. Only solution for it is hit it out of the stadium Sehwag style.,3
Maybe pitch wasn't that bad for batting,4
Csk: I do not guide others to a treasure that I cannot possess,15
Faf & rutu is a better pair than Watto & faf cos these two can run those quick singles and twos.,5
"Remember the one time Chris Gayle while bowling, appealed then went down to his knees and begged with folded hands as a joke

P.s not sure about the down to his knees part

Edit: video https://youtu.be/3IqTMcmtWYw",6
So what's being served on the flight? Idly sambar - filter coffee or Chole Bhature and Lassi?,5
"Most depressed looking cricketers?

Rahane

Neesham",8
"I'm not even gonna be mad if CSK win without losing any wickets, just sad",7
I feel that Brett Lee wants to fucking deck nehra and I can sympathize.,11
KL‚Äôs orange cap still safe he hopes,5
No no no Shami. You cannot make stops like that. We can't afford you being injured for the Australian tests,8
Good length Nehra at it again,2
I miss the times when Faf was being bullied left right and center by the South African media and his confidence was rock bottom. Can't we have that same Faf for one innings. Ffs.,7
Nehra just keeps on going lmao,3
ffs Shami we need you for the Australia tour,5
Ashish Nehra with Gully cricket terms,3
"Idk what it is, but I hate and love Nehra's commentary at the same time.",9
Anyone knows how big of a margin RR needs to win to get there run rate same as RCB/DC. Then I suppose it's going to be a KO match between RCB and DC.,1
Imagine if CSK had shown a little bit of intent that day while chasing 200+ against RR and ended up losing with one digit run. Only if MSD had fired an over earlier instead of firing in the last over.,3
As an RCB fan. I‚Äôm a CSK fan for today. :),5
Kumble at this point totally got desensitized of all emotions.,9

Nehraji please stop talking,1
Not out,0
"Match is pretty much over anyway, they should bowl Gayle for the memes",9
I think KXIP are going for the distinct record of going wicketless against a team throughout the season. +1 from me.,6
"Noooo pirate, how could you.",2
Fastest review ever?,13
Faf is sure it's not out,1
Even Murugan Ashwin knows that it's not out,14
Instant review from Faf. He has no time for your bullshit.,21
So it has been 25 overs since KXIP last took a wicket vs CSK.,10
[deleted],-1
Thank God for DRS,6
Peak ipl umpiring.,5
Lol @Murugan and KL both of them know it's not out,5
Never thought I'd see someone out-alpha Pashchim Pathak but Faf just proved me wrong.,14
[deleted],-1
Lol the body language. Not out,7
They aernt even bowling on stumps XD,1
3rd class umpiring,1
"Faf is like, let's get on with this.",7
Everyone is ready to play!,3
DuPless > DuBoss,2
Nehra in the Dugout seat looking like that kid in the exam hall looking left right and centre at his classmates to see what they are writing.,18
Is nehra doing English commentary today,3
Hit his pad ig,2
Why was ulta edge required??,2
How is that sir? How is that sir? How is that?,5
Paschim pathak nooooo,2
[deleted],2
nO sPaRk‚Ñ¢,3
Damn Lord Pathak with a wrong decision,8
Csk making kxip fans cry today,1
"Paschim pathak, WTF dude!! I know you had that fight with Gill, but don't make KKR pay like this!",11
ROFL,1
Why did they had to add Nehra to Dugout and ruin it?,4
Underwhelming captaincy from KL,1
I have never loved CSK more,6
"Nevr give out when KL appeals, he'll just do it to avoid wides.",16
First bad decision by Rambo.,10
Strange how Gaikwad has been the best Indian player of Spin this season,7
Dugout went from Swannie and Sanjay to fucking Nehra ffs,7
Umpire got better stance than KL Rahul behind the wickets,11
So the question is did Preity pay Pathak in INR or USD? üòÅ,1
I want to see Warner open for csk one day.,7
In today's episode of bad umpiring,6
"Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong. In international matches, third umpires only ever do third umpiring. Here in IPL, third umpires are also field umpires",8
"I was supporting kxip, but now....

10 wickets win, lessgoo",9
Umpire doing the nazi salute for the timeout lmao,5
That 5 wides really ruined the rhythm,9
"Only if CSK had won, one more match this season, it‚Äôd have been a near certain playoff qualification :/",4
This guy Ruturaj is hard to get out now.,1
Kxip looks clueless here,1
Was that out or not? I missed that lbw graph thing,2
"Ashwin is his name. Murugan is his father's name.

Wierd to see commentators keep calling him Murugan",2
WTF did Pashchim just do the Sieg Heil salute,1
"We have found the combination guys. Just remove Jadhav, Chawla, Watson and use the money to get Malan and or any other foreign batsmen with a decent SR and an Indian Batsman(if Raina is not back) and play Sai Kishore in place of Chawla.",6
KXIP have now gone 27 overs and counting (20 overs considered for full game chasing) without taking a wicket against CSK,9
Wtf csk.. live or let live ..,3
KXIP really struggling for wickets against CSK this season. Kinda funny and sad.,9
"Dear CSKians, please stop eyeing our players. No Kanos, Warner, or Rashid will not play for you.",14
[deleted],8
That strategic timeout signal from Paschim is straight out of a bollywood song,9
"I miscalculated 

-Umpire Tommie Wiseau",6
Two to three shit umpiring decisions per match must have been mandatory in this year's IPL.,6
"‡§∞‡§ø‡§§‡•Å‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú ‡§π‡§æ ‡§Ü‡§Æ‡§ö‡§æ ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§≤‡§ó‡§æ ‡§Ü‡§π‡•á. ‡§Ö ‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡§æ ‡§®. 

T: Rituraj is lub",5
Chennai looking to win this by 10 wickets AGAIN and in the process they'll both put a halt to a wonderful comeback and break a million hearts.,4
The actors in LIC ad need to get off crack,2
Indian must produce worst umpires in the world.,1
" Cmon kxip, show people yall can pull it off even if it isn't against SRH!",5
Has anyone tried the pasta pizza. Looks unappetizing,1
So who needs to win for the remainder of the league stage more spicy?,4
CSK being that kid in gully cricket who throws aggressively fast balls if you hit them for a six.,8
Important for the spinners to get in a few cheap overs here,2
"Reminder that if CSK win this in 14 overs, they definitely avoid the bottom of the table as they'll finish above KXIP",6
"KXLP: Dood, just let us win. You're gonna end up in the bottom anyway.

CSK: No, brother. I can't be everyone's bottom bitch, professionals have standards.",15
"To all those saying CSK would've been much closer to playoffs had they won a match:

Look at their NRR",11
No wickets for KXIP against csk this season,10
"For everyone saying CSK would have been in playoff spot if they had won one more game , we never would have played the likes of Gaikwad if we were in contention for play offs . So wouldnt have won the last 2 games.

In reality CSK needed this season to revamp the batting order and infuse youth. Otherwise Dhoni and Fleming would have been too stubborn and still backed the likes of Watson and Jadhav",19
I've been noticing in the last two days.  There are no Kohli ads on Hotstar. 2 out 3 ads used to feature Kohli before.,8
CSK is now the security uncle at the gates of playoffs,17
"KXIP haven't taken a CSK wicket in IPL 2020.

Edit: typo",18
Will the ipl continue alongside the wipl?,3
"Paschim Pathak disclosed his identity with that Nazi salute what an awful Cricket Darwinist, tried to gift KXIP a wicket",3
Aree get a slip in place at least....By being defensive you wont win the match...Attack Damnit,2
[removed],7
Dude Brett Lee is so invested in a KXIP win,8
nooooo... anyway,3
Finally a yellow wicket for the Reds...,4
First wicket against CSK this season,2
"Aw man, no 2 10 wicket wins?",9
A wicket after years?,4
Yooooo,1
"Bishnoi once again with the breakthrough, kid has had an incredible IPL",3
Heck yeah took us 27.4 overs but still got a wicket against CSK lmao,0
Would have been angry with pathak ji if he wasnt waifu,4
Oh dear...........,2
Yay a wick it,2
Man I love Mayank's energy on the field,2
Well that's a good start. But get Faf out ffs!,6
Stupid of Gaikwad playing that shot for a flighted delivery,3
Might be not out because it popped out.,7
The umpire's either a  member of a part-time death metal band or he's coming straight outta Loreal Paris ad shoot.,7
CSK should send Curran now.,7
"I wanted Punjab to qualify just because of the energy they are showing on field, and not like some KKR where they are like ""welp if we win,we win"" attitude.",10
That's not out. Damn.,10
"**AFTER 27.4 OVERS KXIP HAS TAKEN A CSK WICKET GG**

Edit: Fuck",9
Lol,7
Holy cow. That's goita be a drop no?,6
Fml why isn't he walking back now,4
CSK really doesn't want KXIP to go to playoffs,8
Looks like he grassed that.,15
What?????????,1
How is that not out,-1
Bhenchod was that clear and obvious?,2
LMAO what goes on,2
Kl rahul swearing lol,6
NOT OUT LMAO,1
Oooooooh nooo,1
How was that not out?,0
"Yo, whoever is the third umpire, thanks!",3
Mandeep's expression - Bald Pakistani uncle,6
Not out lol,5
......wtf?,3
Lmao,3
It's a proper meme now üòÇ,2
Fuck KXIP,1
Take a DRS then,2
Paschim Pathak shut off stud boy Rahul quickly good,9
KL 'Koach' Rahul.,7
Wtf?,1
Ah fuck...,3
In before CSK win by 10 wickets,6
"Oh no


Anyway",2
Lol,5
Not gonna zoom into that huh?,3
Ultimate bruh moment for KXIP,4
Scenes if Rahul walks off the field with the team,8
AW SHIT SON HE GRASSED IT,10
How. Was. That. Not. Out,6
Wtf is happening,2
The pirate is like walk the plank Rahul.,3
xD,1
Did kl not see the reply?,7
What in the fucking fuck bro,5
Really hope csk doesn't bottle this,7
Umpires are high Lol,1
No loss win today?,2
Rahul your team is already out at least finish in the top 4 for fair play,3
I think wrong button,1
"Bad call, he had it under control",0
I've almost never seen that decision been made even though technically it's correct.,8
The var team has found themselves in the ipl too,1
What a shite decision by 3rd umpire,0
KL fully turned into Kohli now. Questioning 3rd umpire's decision now like VK did yesterday.,6
"Someone should have told KL that if KXIP lose this match then they'll be out of the tournament and he might have to depart from the orange cap if someone scores more runs then him, then he would have scored a match winning century.",2
Fingers not underneath the ball when he landed. The ball was touching the ground with fingers on the side of the ball instead of being underneath it. So clear not out.,10
What the shit. SKY caught one similar yesterday and he got the wicket.,5
"WHAT IS THE FUCKING WORLD!?  


Fuck Fair Play too, if I were KL, I'd be fuming!",2
His hand hit the ground first???? There soft signal was fucking out???,1
shitty umpiring,-1
Pirate umpire wtf yaar,1
Inb4 IPL is rigged comments,3
Looked like a clean take,-5
Ball clearly touched the ground. Are you guys blind or is it just the CSK hate?,24
Clanger from Gaffney,3
CSK topping the fair play. lmao lets goooo.,9
How is csk in top of fair play award?,5
KL: From Dhoni to Virat in one ball,6
Mkl soft signal was out. It's not clear and obvious to overturn it,9
Chad csk on top of fairplay!!,3
"The ball clearly touched the ground, why are people even complaining",12
"N O - spells no, wow some real insightful commentary.",6
Oofa. I'd have given that.,3
We need VAR,2
Is KL cheating?/s wouldve been cheating if this was dhoni right,2
"Well be grassed it , not so surprising",0
Thank you Agent 3rd umpire,3
Salt on the wounds,1
Wtf? There defo wasn't enough evidence there to overturn the soft signal!,9
Universe memeing KXIP with wickets,3
This boundary just rubbed salt into their wounds,4
Added salt on KXIP‚Äôs wounds with that boundary,6
"""let the bodies hit the floor, let the bodies hit the floor""",8
3rd umpire just wanted to keep the meme alive,11
Insult to injury,1
omg i feel so sad for rahul like fr,4
That‚Äôs extremely harsh,8
"Did he have his fingers under the ball, i couldn't tell",6
Even umpires want that 10 wicket meme to stay intact,9
"Resolution for me is super unclear. In your opinion, was that out or not?",3
Chahal caught a ball in the EXACT same style in one of the RCB matches and the batsman was given out. Fuck this,4
Last match! Do or die match for KXIP! They had an incredible comeback from 5 defeats. WHY THE TF WOULD THEY CARE ABOUT FAIRPLAY?!,3
He clearly grassed it.,7
it's like the VAR in premier league Lol,2
That short run decision will haunt them,5
Wtf that looked clean?,-4
I can feel kl dieing a little inside with each run,2
Boundary toward the same player is just pure saaalt,6
"Nah I agree. His hands were to the side, the ball clearly hit the ground.

I'm the first person to critisize CSK, but I agree with that decision.",11
"Player: *shows a little bit of dissent

Umpire: boi, your fair play points goin down over here",4
"No point in blaming the team now, script gods have decided that KXIP must never win an IPL lmao",5
Kxip should walk out for that terrible call,-6
"He touched the ball to the ground, what do you not understand?. It's not a clean catch.",11
"Why can't IPL commentators call out umpiring blunders?   


Would they really be reprimanded? Because if they're supposed to comment on the match, not commenting on an absolute shit show of a decision just means they're not doing their jobs.",-3
How the fuck is Chennai top of Fairplay awards?,5
Gaikwad is such a class.,3
Interesting stats KXIP hasn't taken wicket of CSK for 28 overs. That's some shit bowling.,2
Rutu hitting a boundary is like adding salt to KXIP's wounds,4
That was not out. I don't know what you guys saw. I clearly saw the ball hitting the ground with his fingers on the sides.,11
The fucker didn‚Äôt even zoom in for that that‚Äôs some dumb ass bullshit,4
"i love how the umpire is like a dad at a playground. patting KL on back like ""cmon bhetta just play. ure not going win anyway cmon""",12
He caught it wtf,3
"Target for CSK to chase in order to overtake the teams in NRR:

KKR: 19.1 overs

RR: 16 overs

KXIP: 14 overs

Overtaking KXIP will ensure they avoid the last place, while overtaking the other teams help them avoid the 8th place for some time at least. The result of KKR vs RR will decide the last place between CSK and the loser of that game",7
The ball clearly bounced the ground. First time was sus second time was a given.,3
I love KL. But sometimes he acts like a cry baby. You either be a Kohli or a Dhoni,8
"If alm teams have same fairplay points, who gets award?",2
Should have gone with the soft signal there imo.,3
Kxip fans: where's rock and roll when we actually need it,3
LMAO someone saying tatti karoge,6
"Law 33.3

The act of making a catch shall start from the time when the ball first comes into contact with a fielder‚Äôs person and shall end when a fielder obtains complete control over both the ball and his/her own movement

So I guess they're saying he wasn't under control of the ball when he touched it to the ground",9
"It's the correct decision not sure everyone is complaining.

When taking a catch its required to fully cover the ball . But here he had covered the sides but middle part was touching the ground.",12
Did you hear that?,2
"Given that the resolution of the replay wasn't the best, I assumed the 3rd umpire would go with the on field umpire's soft signal",1

KL Rahul lets it slide easily. Dhoni would have walked on the pitch.,9
Rahul was abusing between overs??,5
Conclusively Bullshit lmao,5
Lol didnt he grass it at th3 last second in the replays? Like he caught it then released it and it hit the ground,3

You guys have a shitty stream and blame on 3rd umpire for not zooming in lol. It clearly touched the ground,29
New cutlure in Indian cricket. Arguing with umpires when you don't like their decisions.,9
Who is the third umpire?,3

"Soft signal is a joke.

Why do you act like you consider it.",9
"Not in Control, fair call imo",6
Chad Pathak vs Virgin Rahul,11
The law states that the player must have control of the ball the ball touched ground before he gaind full control.,11
It was not clear enough to overturn the decision. A touch and go decision cannot be overturned when it is not clear. Fuck off,2
"So now this and that short run. Blaming maxwell can take a back seat, yikes!",3
Whatever happened to soft signal.,3
"I know battle for playoffs is very interesting this year and all but since the temperature went down in Emirates, it's been like you win the toss...you win the match...last I remember it was MI vs RR where MI choose to bat but still lost...",4
Zinta also dying inside with each run,8
"That was not out. Ball clearly wobbled on the second bounce.

Still Nehra with the great point about whether the umpire had enough evidence to overturn the on field umpires. Makes no sense to have the soft decision.",11

Due process BC. Soft signal and all. 100% sure required and that was anything but,3
Gaffney gaffe?,2
Nehra is like that annoying troll reddit account who will never get banned by mods but because of him others get banned.,4
It's destined. KXIP can't get a wicket off CSK this season.,4
"So not scoring 1 off 3 balls (2 full tosses), came back to haunt KXIP as expected.",8
The umpire should have atleast zoomed in and confirmed whether the catch was taken or not. Surprised at how fast he made the decision after one look at it,11
" Really gotta feel for Kl Rahul, he gave it his all this season",12
I m a big fan CSK.,2

 suggest others pls",9
That‚Äôs a four du plessis,1
the probability of my crush replying to my texts and KXIP taking a wicket against CSK is the same,4
So basically KXIP cant get a wicket against CSK,2
MSD to come at 4 and finish the game and blind Thala fans will tell he's back in form  ü§°ü§°ü§°,8
Jordan should be replacement for replacement bowler. No spark at all,3
it clearly hit the ground im not sure what people are upset about,9
They are fighting in dugout lol,5
Nehra started length.,2
All these victories only to get ass fucked by CSK in the end. What a tragedy for Punjab.,11
"Where is swanny, I miss him",2
Where were you when kxip was kill?,8
Why is nehra in dugout ffs,5
I'm liking CSK match threads nowadays. Earlier I would dread them for the thousands of original sarcastic Thala comments.,4
Kumble needs to suck it up lol,1
"Not taking away anything from his career as a player, but I can't believe this clown was our bowling coach lmao",5
When he took the catch the fingers were underneath which is fine but he changed the position when he landed with fingers sideways and ball touching the ground. That means he is not in complete control of the ball when he landed.,7
"First match dubious short run. Last match this dubious not out.

Finally a CSK wicket for KXIP in 2020.,7
Madlad Rahul asking the third umpire if the catch is clear enough,11
Plz confirm this out,3
Who did the Rahul appeal to ? Third ump?,1
Beat the top 4 teams effortlessly and got thrashed by the bottom two teams. Just Punjab things,9
Let's fucking go,2
Better go to third umpire to just confirm it... Maybe no ball,9
Inbe4 not out again,6
KL checking with the umpire for the decision lol,7
Is that a wicket?,2

a really good season for Faf with the bat.,5
"ROFL, was he appealing to 3rd umpire?",10
Savage KLPD appealing to Gaffney for the catch,6

I wish they played Kedar today to give him a go at finding form or something,4
Kl Rahul is a madlad lol,5
Calm down Rahul. You guys shat the bed with your batting. Don't get mad at the umpire.,16
KL stfu nonce,1
We are currently 9-13 in CSK‚Äôs favour in h2h. But I swear we always get clapped by Chennai except that one game where CSK bottled it after Raina decided to go apeshit,5
Rahul the madlad showing Chris gaffney that it is clear catch.,3
"Damn, jordan was almost gonna cry",4
"Jesus f'ing Christ. You allow the game to drift all innings in a must win game. No slips at all to the spinners. No plan to save singles or apply pressure and then when a decision rightfully goes against you, you get all salty and act like a dickhead. Lol.",19
"Why is Faf surprised with that bat angle? it was almost perpendicular to the trajectory of the ball, could only go upwords, not backwords.",4
CSK have locked up fair play award at least,8

You know the Hindification project is going well when a born and bred southie like KL's go to swear is behen ki lund.,18
The position in which RCB & DC find themselves at this point can only be achieved by these two teams. Monday is gonna be a meme matchup. Who can fuckup better.,7

KL you're my hero. The third umpire can take the piss.,14
"KL Rahul : was that out
Third umpire : definitely not",3
All they need to do now is tuk tuk their way to victory.,2
What would've KL done if they gave a no ball after he signalled to the 3rd umpire. Lol,28
"Serious question. Why are the commentators and third umpire always standing, whenever they are on camera??!
Do they keep standing throughout the game now-a-days??",4
Only a miracle or a Thala special can save KIXP now,11

May KL channels this anger in weaving some magic!,4
I am just amazed at how immune you have all become to that DJ,2
KXIP bowlers took the strike rate comment too seriously.,3
Time to take it deep!,4
How did Nehra and Bangar get in the dugout? Star should invest in better security.,10
Time for rutu to spark,1

"Rohit in the nets there. 

He's absolutely necessary in Australia",13
"After so many high flying years, this was the year when the CSK stock just....crashed.

In How many overs CSK has to finish to go above KKR in net run rate? Battle for 7th place is on baby.,8
Gaikwad looks like a possible test player.,3

RR -0.377

KKR -0.467



**KKR vs RR:** The loser goes out of the tournament. Winner (call them X) goes to point 14.

**RCB vs DC:** The winner goes in top 2 with 16 points. The loser (call them Y) will remain at 14 points.

**SRH vs MI:** 

If SRH lose, they are out. X and Y goes into the playoffs. 

If SRH wins, SRH will go into the playoffs for sure because of NRR advantage (0.555). One of X and Y go out based on NRR.",5
So the 14 over chase is not happening,-1
Well swann England winning world cup was also not conclusive.,12
"If fairplay award was given to players instead of teams , which doesnt make sense ik ( as if it does rn) , kanos will keep winning it till he retires",7

Give Swann a raise ffs,7
Here we go with swanys live replay,3
Greame swann's crack on full display.,3

Swanny is a fucking lunatic,7
Lmao Swann is getting political,8
"Please stop having so much intent to win, KXIP. You are starting to win my support.",6
The only thing I am looking forward to now is KL's post match interview,9
I want to know what Swamy would say if it was RR was fielding,12
Lol Dugout is the best. Isn‚Äôt it,20
"Whenever rahul says ""acha hai"" next ball goes for a boundary",13
Swanny bringing in Brexit and trump in the game.,20
Rayudu is baked in Ranji. He is a better player of spin than most of the India Int'l batsmen,6
Kumble is about to cry!!,5
Swanny: That's like your opinion man,6
Lmao swanny talking about Trump and brexit what is happening,15
Thala set a horrific precedent of rebuking umpire decisions among Indian players and it is showing up,-4
By how much does RR need to win by to overtake RCB/DC's NRR?,3
Damn Dugout is losing its shit. Stop arguing and get over it.,10
I think the only reason SRH isn‚Äôt on the top of the fair play table is cuz of Khaleel,15
"This is gonna get over in the 17th over, just enough for CSK to miss the wooden spoon",4
Wtf is happening in the dugout.,11
"IF KXIP won today, DC vs RCB could have been one of the most hyped league game in the IPL history. Winner finishes top 2, loser finishes outside playoff spots. CSK robbed us.",5
Swanny and corky beef,9
"Eh. I stopped watching as game seemed dead. What the fuck am I reading..


Swanny did what now lmao?!",10
"The Dugout has given four fucks about the last 2-3 overs because of that grassed catch, literally didn't even mention the boundary. Brilliant.",9
"So, the incorrect short run indeed cost kxip a spot in playoffs!.. kumble was right to report to BCCI",14

"https://youtu.be/B4t1izuBS-E?t=322

How was this different to the catch today?",1
"So, with Kings losing the match I guess Kolkata has the highest chance of qualifying?",1
I fucking love the Dugout.,8
Dugout is WWE level chaotic rn,12
I feel like swanny is kinda loose in the head,5
Dugout is what I hoped every commentary argument turned into,9

"You know what.  
I want one wicket to go down when there are approx 10 runs left and see Dhoni hit the winning runs.  
I know he isnt who he used to be and he's stayed on wayy past the optimal time to retire but...  
  
y'know...I just want him to hit the winning runs one final time. It doesnt matter if its not a six or anything..I'll take a squeaky single.  
  
Just one final time. It'd be nice to say bye.",1
Can someone post a screenshot where we saw Swann's buttcrack? Asking for a friend.,4
CSK is dying (winning) for our sins.,8
"This could be Dhoni‚Äôs last match ever. That makes me a little unsettled. I know he‚Äôs not been a popular guy over the last year or so, but still. The memories.",-1
No Harsha a single off every ball and 2 boundaries don‚Äôt get you to victory. They only get you to a draw. Do some basic math ffs,9
Sad I'm outside not watching this match. Pls give sauce to swanny ass crack or whatever,7
You know a team has been dominant when they are top of both fairplay and points table,4
Please show altroz now on tv so swany can jerk off and calm down,8
Swann is a r/cricket troll confirmed.,5
Bachan causally advertising Gujarati Ass(es).,6
"Gaikwad is like fuck the team, I am going to finish it myself.",3
I see Hooda came out to play eh.,2
"Tf is going on in the dugout, can someone give me the context?",2
"With Swann's love for antics, he would fit well in big boss/big brother",2
[deleted],15
Csk finish this fast and don't almost bottle it like last match,8
Can I ask from where are all these dugout comments coming from? I'm watching on Star sports 1 and here Harsha is commenting. I also wanna see the dugout action.,9
"People saying had Bravo not been injured CSK would have won against DC and still been in the playoffs race.

Well, shouldn't have choked againt KKR then üò∂

Also Gaikwad was brought in because CSK were already out of the race",10
Fuck Rayudu,1
"Where is CSL NRR strategy? Why not promote Curran, Jagdeeshan or Jadeja?
Fucking tuktuk Rayudu should be demoted to 9 or 10 to avoid all out.",-8
Once rayudu showed intent to run and....,3
"Mayank out 

r/cricket : the pressure of KL's inning cost him the wicket. 

Faf out 

r/cricket : Stupid shot !!!",22
"Sigh of all the crazy stuff in this KXIP season, I think where they really messed up was taking the KKR match outta the bag and gifting it to them.",13
That short run will be the difference between kxip and DC in the end lol,16
"Ah yes, Mavichandran Ashwin",11
Whyd swann have to do that in no nut november üò£,6
Puri Qaynaat conspiring to bring RR to playoffs. Trust KKR to do massive fuckup today.,7
Ashwin is always able to get this tennis ball spin,4
I feel CSK are gonna choke like Sasha Grey with James Deen,-1
"Rahul : Build that pressure. Build that pressure boy.  
Ashwin : I shan't",3
"Thala Dhoni trending, time for a good inning from Dhoni ü¶Å",2
What is this sextillion meme,4
Rayudu is gonna cost csk this match isnt he?,3
CSK really hates Kxip...,3

With others: P10 W6 L4",7

I'm still trying to figure out how swanny started talking about brexit and trump all of a sudden.,10
Petition for DC to give KXIP 2 points,7
"I think most of the players wouldn't mind losing. At least can get out of the bubble and go home to family, parents, wife, kids, friends",5
Swanny gone so quiet. He's mad lmao,5
"I loved how Swann was just trolling Cork and Sanjay all along and ended with ""light up a bit corky""",7
1 good over with a couple of wickets and CSK can still do it,4
"I am with [Swanny on this one](https://i.imgur.com/w2Gk3M6.jpg)


It's out.",5
Another net video of Rohit doing the rounds. After Shastri said he should rest. Good fight developing.,4
Can they pick Rohit back in the side now?,2
CSK- Kabhi kabhi toh lagta hai ki apanich bhagwan hai.,3
"Didn't expect MAshwin, Chawla ji and Chakravarthy to be bowling faster googlies than Rashid quick-arm-action Khan.",3
Kkr vs rr who do you think will win ?,1
"I swr to god if dhoni comes in next instead of curran/jadeja, im going to lose my shit. Thala is going to bottle the game wanting to finish it on a 6.",8
The only reason swanny is favouring towards csk is because he wants Punjab to lose so that Rajasthans chances are still alive,20
C'mon Neesham,1
"Man if csk takes the game deep i have faith that kxip wins, they have been that bad this year don't do it plesss",6
They should atleast take Rohit to Australia,7
Swan is right others are too scared to speak the truth,5
Csk looking good,1
Vadapavman return??,2
Neesham either gonna get smash or will get a wicket.,2
"Ufff, finally Bangar is giving a legit update on Rohit Sharma's status.",10
Ravi Shastri came out and said Rohit shouldn't play. Kind of crazy that he is saying something about this. And why should anyone trust Ravi Shastri.,2
"Gayle is gonna bowl an over, isnt he?",6
Csk grabbing KXIP with them on the plane back home,10
haha KKR fans so concerned about CSK choking. I have seen it all.,9
SRH thanks CSK,4
We need a r/dugoutOutOfContext,8
Lovely fielding,2
CSK were always going to come good as pitches get slower and games get low scoring. There issue is competing in 180+ games,11
Rayadu ran quick two and then ran one extra... Punjab is fucked,13
Csk going to win without any more boundaries,2
Pls get a wicket /u/UnleashTheQuiche,9
Maybe it's just my paranoid self  but what's the chance CSK can still choke form here?,8
I just saw the dream 11 ad with Hardik. This man is still dabbing in 2020.  It's not even ironic. Ffs.,12
Ayye on which channel does this dugout come...,5
[deleted],9
Can KL show the same aggression while batting,10
"Cmon Neesham, make us smile but with your bowling this time around.",3
Who writes these IPL scripts,2
"Rayudu, kl does a 32(31) , r/cricket: YOU FUCKING BOMBOCLAT

Rutu does a 32(31), r/cricket: sweetheart UwU",16

Smith sometimes looks like Alexander the Great,2
Dhoni padded up to take the game deep....,17
KXIP need some dhoni magic here to even have a remote chance,5
PLEASE TELL ME WHAT DID I MISS ON THE DUGOUT,8
Dhoni to win it with a 6,3
"Rayudu knows it's the last match of the season. He is running 2s, be very afraid!",11
Go rayudu make jadhav proud,9
Dugout comms are disagreeing with each other over everything lol,3
"Story feels similar for RCB ,KXI and DC. No wonder they dont have a IPL cup.",9
Please CSK don't choke.,9
"CSK for 10 years: We play all playoffs

CSK now: We decide who plays playoffs",70
Yup seen it all Rayudu ran a 3,18
Hope kkr loses today.,10
Bishnoi should be fast-tracked into IndiaT20s in place of Kuldeep,3
"So happy that CSK has hit peak momentum right at the end of the league stage, must be really strong now in the playoffs",16
Dugout is lit today. Someone tell them they are not on a news channel discussion.,12
Rayudu walking this chase with a strike rate of 85.. LMAO,2
Dhoni's hair ugly af,5
Bishnoi didn't have a good match today and that's hurting KXIP a lot. Usually he pretty good in the middle overs,12
"Harsha showing off his IIMA degree maths. Dude, we get the math. Chill.",-3
Dugout has been chaotic all day.,8
I love swanny but now he‚Äôs just being an asshole,-2
Wow. Swann is on haha.,6
"Kings, together, no playoffs",2
Savage swann bullying Corky,7
"Tbh this IPL feels boring

First half of IPL it batting first team would usually win

And now win the toss, chase, win the match

Nothing exciting.",10
"Rayudu is running quick today, ""What have they done to my boy!""",9
What does Neesham brings to the table except internet points?,13
Looks like they gonna take this to last over,5
What happened in the dugout ? Can anyone explain for star sports viewers ?,13
That timing tho,9
~~Robin~~ Rutu Sparkles,7
"Life Pro Tip:



Get yourself a friendship like CSK and RR. Both win together, lose together, get banned for 2 years together. CSK is busy helping their best friend RR secure a play-off spot.





EDIT: RR beats up CSK's bully MI too. 
Thanks for suggesting that Bros.",114
"Kxip are fucked, aren't they?",7
I don't mind Gaikwad playing with 100-120 strike rate....he is giving CSK stability they lacked... He is holding one end properly,21

"Harsha talking bout this the most exciting finish to the IPL, but CSK being total party poopers.",4
I agree with Corky - Don't post his Brohit batting videos on your official handle. This creates confusion/conspiracy theories in fans minds. Is he really fit but dropped by giving fitness as a reason - These kind of questions could be easily avoided.,6

Good Boi Gaikwad‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüíØ,4
I think csk win makes this an anti climax because rr and kkr and terrible nrr and srh just needs victory if they don't win in VS mi maybe they didn't deserve the playoffs...,2
Marlon,2
I wonder how Ruturaj will play when the team bats first and has to set a target. Will be interesting to see next year.,8
Marlon mate would you like to say something before the mods ban you?,6
Hattrick 50s and Hattrick MOTM loading....,4

Feel so bad for Gaikwad. Could've been a contender for emerging player of the year. But instead he had to watch from the sidelines as CSK persisted with the 40 year old Shane Watson..,9
Is there a way both SRH and RR makes it to the playoffs?,3
"While everyone's having Marlon Samuels-themed fun, apparently he's releasing a diss track lmao",2
It is clear Bois. CSK didn't qualify because of Thala's piss poor team selection. We had the squad to make it but Thala had other ideas.,9
Pretty sure y'all are gonna get the bot banned from this sub at the rate it's being called.,14
Marlon,0
If only KXIP had Marlon Samuels,9
Gaikwad showing how tuk-tuk openers should play. Accumulate in the beginning and accelerate after you get set. Not tuk-tuk till you die.,6

This match is gone.. Well played KXI, you earned some fans towards the End.. Only complaint is the defence of 127 against SRH. We would hav been in playoffs..

CSK need to do a KXIP to lose this match.,3
Marlon Samuels woulda been a handful here,-1
I think Punjab shouldn't fire Kumble next season he had only one mini auction at his helm very difficult to make team in one Auction & should be given another chance fir next year. This Kumble-Rahul combo can do wonders for them.,5

2016 final was definitely the most emotional moment in IPL history.,1

Rayudu lazy fuck.,5
15 or so balls of KXIP's campaign left to go. The streak that promised so much but can't beat CSK then you don't deserve it.,10
They should just beat the shit out of the opposition like they did with KKR,2

Blinding spark,3
Hope CSK forfeit the match now so that KXIP can advance.,4
Part time keeper after all. Bad game for Rahul,3
This cannot be good for NRR. /s,2
Yo Shami bowl some yorkers,1
KL can't be a long term solution as keeper for India.,2
"Gg kxip, you were magnificent",3
That's it. I am downvoting comments that invoke that shitty bot. It stopped being funny 5 years ago.,14
Time to get retire hurt and give dhoni a chance for six finish,2
3rd consecutive MOTM for Gaikwad lmao? Or Ngidi,4
"I think the major reason csk are performing this well is becuase the pitches have slowed down like the cheapuk.. Thier batting line up has always been a 160 team.. That's what thier bowling has done, restricting teams to less than that... If csk had managed a couple of more wins at the beginning they were sure shot contenders this season",13
Amitabh Bachchan is gonna kidnap CSK and KXIP and force them to eat shrimp ice cream or something while drooling about the Dubai Expo.,5

Maxwell will still be in punjab next season because they didn't lose the match because of maxi,3
RR won the toss and are bowling first. Come on Rajasthan,9

"Fixed, how can one team end up with the same points for 3 seasons? They must have some kind of a contract",3

If I was KXIP fan those five straight wins would have hurt more than this loss....,5
"When you realize 1 day old bot has more karma than you 
*sob* *sob*",8
Steven Smith has won the toss and RR will bowl first,4
"Tempering with winning combination has been detrimental for KXIP this match, Arshdeep is deeply missed",2
Shutting down the Marlon bot for now because pretty sure it would trigger some sort of filter if it kept spamming.,14
"Okay this bot is stupid, mods please ban it",9
Should have dropped Mandeep for Agarwal,6
This is where Arshdeep would‚Äôve helped Punjab.,6
Lol! Every team has won atleast 6 games this ipl. This must be the first instance.,4
Have kxip heard of a Yorker,5
"So which team should I support next?
Csk and KXIP are gone now.",5
"IPL almost coming to end, still altroz is best car and Kent gives subse sudh paani.",14
Heartbreaking for Punjab. All that effort for nothing. Well at least Rahul will get to keep his orange cap and captaincy for one more season.,5
"In other news, RR has won the toss and they are fielding first.",5
Bro even RCB will qualify this year. Wtf kXIPüò≠,6
In hindi commentry they are taking about just csk from last half an hour. Like I am watching a news channel in India v Pakistan match.,1
Cut the telecast out to the next match already. This is done. Punjab are the Bangalore 2.0.,3
Please tell me Rayudu just didn't ask Gaikwad to slow down ffs,5
"More than a spark, it was the pressure. With the pressure gone, players are performing. It's almost the same team.",8

Why is Gayle bowling lol?,3

Won't get to see Priety Zinta jump up and down up and down tonight,3

Adios to the most exciting team of this tournament. All those super overs and last ball finishes will be cherished.,13
Please Gayle play one more year. üò≠üò≠ Please.,7
No one disrespecting universe boss,3
KL thinks he's MSD and Gayle is Joginder,6
His economy is really not bad!,2
Who is seated behind Mayank's wife? I see her in every KXIP game.,2

"Bruh, I can just listen to Gayle talking at the batsmen and the fielders all day. Let him bowl all 20.",3
CSK should definitely buy Gayle next auction,3
This reminds me of Adam Gilchrist bowling in his last match and getting a wicket,6
The next IPL being so close means at least we get another season of Gayle.,7
faf could have finished this match by the 14th over.,2
Kxip predicted the future. The 1-short against dc cost them in the end. Sad,11
"https://youtu.be/3IqTMcmtWYw

He's not bad actually",2
RCB used to had few really tough games as Gayle used to bowl 4 overs :) seeing Gayle bowl is nostalgia,8
Gayle is retiring,7
The only reason KXIP didn't play the Universe Boss earlier was so that KL could get the orange cap,6
Gaikwad seems to have very high cricket iq. No brainless shots,11
So a 10 wicket win and a 9 wicket win for CSK against KXIP this season.,9
Only kxip can choke from this position.,6
Chris Gayle bowls?!,3
Bad way to go out Kings XI. Should‚Äôve gone out swinging.,2
Scores tied!! Super over???,2
No wonder Lee is pissed at this. Why are you conceding before the match is over. Moronic captaincy.,8

Gayle throwing some words in Hindi there just for the lulz.,3

Shit the KXIP men look so let down!,3
"Well 2 teams have been eliminated now, who‚Äôs the next one on the chopping block? RR or KKR?",3
Feelsbadman,2
Rahul setting his orange cap lol,6
[deleted],3
That one fucking bad decision of umpire to give it a short run has costed KXIP a playoffs spot.,8
It‚Äôs better to let csk qualify.. when they become party poopers this is what happens.. üòÇü§£,11
"Just want to say this famous tamil dialogue

""Inni vayasukku vantha varalana enna""",3
What are the chances of both RR and SRH going in playoffs and not one of RCB and DC?,7
Sooo whoever wins in RR vs KKR qualifies now??,4
Gaand mai daal le abh rahul orange cap ko,15
"KL after the winning run was scored, ""Where's my orange cup, can't find i- ah there it is""",10
"Next year, better script bois.",11
Poor Jagdeeshan. Didn‚Äôt get to bat today either. Maybe next season he will.,11
Changing my flair,2
Share auto to the airport KXIP? What do you say?,10
See this is why Dhoni said it won‚Äôt be his last match . He doesn‚Äôt get to bat today .,26
KXIP only took 1 wicket in 2 matches against CSK,16
So I planned to support CSK and KXIP this season. And they both are the first to be out of contention,19
Dhoni was kinda  wanting one of them to get out so that he could hit the winning six lol,11
"OK before going, who is that grey eyed girl in the punjab camp!!!",7
"Sorry for being spammy, but I only replied when I was invoked. 

I will be back. 

sextillion7thbot will never die.",13
"CSK overtake KKR's NRR. If KKR loses by more than 8 runs, they finish bottom of the table.",4
CSK are truly champions. They have the highest number of points for a team finishing last.,8
What's our NRR now? They could have gone for a final flourish and atleast taken us to 7th or 6th place,3
Punjab have one of the strongest top 4‚Äôs in the tournament. Just need a better overseas all rounder and get Rahul to be be more aggressive. Top 4 contenders again next year now they‚Äôve figured out a role for Gayle.,11
Thala will be teaching captaincy and keeping tactics to KLPD on the way back then,7
HOLY FUCK CSK IN 7TH,10
Heart Break Kings.,5
KKIP: Your fight is over.,7
"Rahul has only himself to blame for this. That, and some smarter calls at clutch moments in the initial games would've prevented such a situation. 

Rahul will now have to hang around for another week, just to pick up the cap at the end of the tournament.",10
"Cmon RR, screw KKR so that we're not the wooden spoon holders.",6
"Sad that we won't be able to see Gayle, shami, mayank and rahul alas good for csk...",5
Dhoni twice as happy because not only did they win the match but they also gained a bit of NRR because of 7 balls left,12
"Thanks KXIP for an exciting season and offcourse Universe Boss finally showing his bowling skills !!

Show some respect to the name, will be back after few months....

I hope KXIP management doesn't get involved again and let Kumble handle team",12
Punjab have only made the playoffs twice in 13 season. Damn that‚Äôs poor,15
They should show a 'KO' like the Q on the table to show knocked out teams,7
Aight guys. Atleast we ended the season on a high. Sad rhat we didn't go through even when we had the arsenal to.  But good luck to all teams going forward. We will see you next year! :d,23
Thanks for all the entertainment KXIP,9
"Will someone explain why everybody spamming marlon, ik his controversy but what happened today?",5
KKR can qualify from the bottom spot. Wtf,21
"Fair play to KXIP, they did an amazing job to even be close to getting into the playoffs. Should be proud non the less",3
[redacted],3
"If KKR lose, they'll 100% finish 8th. 

If RR lose, they'll need to lose by a heavier margin for them to finish 8th.",10
KKR please bottle please,9
So Punjab out of the playoffs eh?,8
Csk hit that nail in kings XI coffin from the neatherrealm lmao. Just hoping fellow banbros rr win it all now.,13
"I think both RCB and DC will easily qualify , given their run rate.",7
Unless SRH looses badly. Is this the end for KXIP?,2
KL orange cap Rahul,5
"Matches are becoming a bit predictable. Win the toss, Bowl(edit: bat) second, win the match.",5
Did Dhoni return Sam's fistbump? :/,12
"Thanks KXIP for all the memories and especially making this IPL 2020 a memorable and interesting one! 

Ngl I am feeling sad :)",28
"If CSK weren't so fucking stupid about their team selection early in, they'd have easily qualified. Look at the way Gaikwad's played opening or how Tahir's done. Kept giving games to Jadhav, Watson, Vijay & co though lmao",25
I'm sad they are out. But glad that this loss gives DC a bit of a rope.,4
GG KXIP. You never stopped entertaining us. The points table really doesn't justify your class.,14
How the fuck Dhoni  did not see any spark in Gaikwad is beyond me. The guy is clearly very talented and plays spin so wonderfully.,22
Good come back from csk and kxip.,4
Does this mean both rcb and DC are through?,2
"What a find Gaikwad is !! He will be as good in next IPL , wherever it is UAE or Chepauk",12
Dhoni is playing IPL 2021? Congratulations CSK.,12
Only if someone could take away Orange cap from Rahul,7
Its been a tough season for us CSK fans. Nonetheless it's been a good ride. Hopefully we'll be back next season stronger. Aight bois. Signing off.,21
Arshdeep died for this smh,14
Maybe KXIP can lift Rahul's orange cap?,19
Now to see the epic Twitter meltdown about the short run,22
"Dw Kxip and Csk players, some friends from Bengal will join you on the flight back soon",7
How do we qualify without winning our last match?,13
Qualifying to the playoffs is overrated ~ KL Rahul probably,17
So history repeats.CSK eliminates KXI again in IPL.,11
What happens if DC and RCB win the next matches? Does SRH go to play offs even losing with MI?,1
GaikGODüòõ,9
Probably the biggest highlight of this IPL was KX run. It's over now.  *sad bagpipes music*,1
It hurts more to see us play this way once we‚Äôre already out,19
[Mods removed my post :/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/jlmtpn/-/gapyxi1),7
GG Punjab. Next year. Was a great turnaround.,7
What would be truly meme is if DC or RCB beat the other so badly that they not only lose but get kicked out of the tournament.,9
Fuck!! I lost 10 Reddit coins.,5
"Don't worry KXIP, you can try again in 5 months in the next IPL season",4
Fuck this dhoni tribute. Fucking cringe,-1
KXIP magical comeback story go bruh..,12
WHAT IS THISüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ,2
KL sounds so sad,12
Why star sports giving a send off to MSD. We want him in next IPL,6
Saddest post-match handshake. Both teams know neither is going anywhere. Every player just looks.... Dead,16
why does KL's expression look like a 5 year old?,3
and people actually thought KL will beat Kohli's top season.,7
Lmao Thala AMV,2
KL is ded inside,9
CSK montage  is making me cry:(,10
"I'm comfortable with this tournament. From where we were to where we got with the various unlucky points. Punjab played well just heavily unlucky and had we a better coach, we would've deffos made a larger impact.",7
Star sports tryna make us cry,0
Do CSk finish ahead of kxip??,2
"boost is the secret of my energy. 
result is the the byproduct of the process.",6
[deleted],3
Real sad about going out of play offs. Hope we had won more tosses in these last few games and things could have been different.,7
"GG KXIP, you gave us a lot of entertainment this year, I hope you come back firing on all cylinders next year!!",11
Do they really need the 3 min cringe song about Dhoni to masturbate to?,18
Is KX11P out now?,5
"Here how it goes the loser of RCB vs DC will play one of SRH, RR, KKR  in play - offs.",1
"No wonder dhoni didn't see a spark in gaikwad
The guy is a whole frickin explosion!",29
The song for MSD was cringe but I loved it ü•≥,11
Oh my god the sheer amount of tHaLa cock sucking on star sports is insane. Jeebus!,10
"Thats the saddest orange cap holder

In like forever",31
I‚Äôm sad that RCB vs DC is not a knockout anymore,6
"It‚Äôs okay KL, come back strong and win India the WC.",25
"Man DC tried hard to not get qualified, but these teams are not letting them to. Tmrws game is only for top 2. Both of them will go through.",9
Man KL looks so devastated . I feel for the guy.,22
"Does anyone know where i can find stats for the total runs scored and total overs faced by a team in the IPL. I want to know how much RR can realistically improve their NRR by, but cant find these specific stats.",1
"Fuck maxwell, fuck cottrell, fuck kxip, every year man its the same story",15
"Someone posted how kxip/rcb and kl/koach are similar

The only difference is koach got used to it and doesn't even feel anything rn. He laughed yesterday ffs and also gave some tips lol",30
After all CSK wasn't so bad. Won six matches.,21
This CSK looks dangerous. TOO Late now.,33
Whats the song just played for Dhoni tribute?,4
"KL aggressive like Kohli on the field 

Shaky shaky hips in the post match presentation like Dhoni 

KL ultimate captain Rahul",36
"With 9 wickets in hand, CSK could have finished lot early imo. But what a turn around from CSK, last 3 games with convincing wins. Peaked too late.",14
"If RCB lose the DC game, do they still Qual?",6
So if SRH lose.. DC and RCB play for 2nd spot right?,10
Maxwell should be dropped.,17
"If we have the technology, why don't stupid shit like incorrect no ball/short run calls get immediately overturned?",9
No Arshdeep and KXIP went arse deep,12
Yo the teams that qualify. Promise me you wont let mi win. PROMISE,39
Does RR have a chance at making it to the playoffs somebody pls explain?,3
"Now that Australians have had an abysmal IPL, they now take back with them everything they‚Äôve learnt about Indian batsmen‚Äôs weaknesses and Indian bowlers‚Äô secrets. They‚Äôre ready to thump us at home",16
"Alright they've made it interesting now. The battle for wooden spoon avoidance makes RR vs KKR key for CSK. 

Big win for either team will be good. The times have changed. üòë",10
Young virat kohli lol that's high praise,26
"Every pitch in this phase of tournament would have suited CSK 
 
If only they weren't so bad in the first half of tournament",14
This is the first time in the history of IPL that every team has won more than or equal to 6 matches.,27
"Lookin at what Curran and Gaikwad have shown this season, CSK can really move forward by willing to take slight hit next season, give a few more youngsters like Jagadeesan the full 15 games and see where it takes them. Dhoni carrying on is a step backward for the side. The transition is going to be delayed and you're deterring the development of a younger player who can take the team forward. That is still okay if Dhoni performs like say a Gayle, but he is a clear liability with the bat I don't think it serves any purpose to CSK on the field. Off the field, yes, Dhoni carrying on is huge for the IPL and CSK.",18
so kxip has been eliminated right?,11
"Man, even though I am happy that CSK won... that KL interview was depressing to watch, damn",26
"If you don't play Maxwell , You will lose. Simple",10
Man the short run really did end up costing KXIP huh?,19
MI RCB DC SRH / winner of next game. See you in playoffs.,6
[deleted],-12
Can only be excited for future of CSK. Looks good. I hope we have found a new Albie in Curran.,15
No one takes it deep like CSK. Won all 3 games after they were out of the tournament.,24
"As happy as I am about CSK's victory, I really feel bad for KL. The guy has a standard expression that screams, ""I am tired of this verised lyf"".

I hope he goes a long way in his career.",24
Pls faf captain csk next year,10
KKR at 8th position cab still end up at 3rd place with just one win... RCB were 3rd in the points table and lost 3 games.. Only to move up to 2nd place... Quite the mindfuck,14
"I am RCB fan but I am feeling so sad and wants to cry :)

KXIP please comeback stronger next season...",12
Well at least we're not getting wooden spoon this year!,7
Indian Super League football famous in India? How's viewership?,2
So anyone got the clip of that KL Rahul stump mic rant? I really want to show to my friends before I take a nap.,12
Anyway thanks for the memories KXIP.,17
LOL. RCB should thank KKR for their NNR.,13
What‚Äôs the short run game?,2
CSK bad team selection caused them play off berth. In the end they were just 1 or 2 matches away from qualifying.,19
"Nevertheless, KXIP table toppers on entertainment. 
Lot of could have beens like KL said..",13
"So are the teams getting eliminated leave bio bubble now or will they wait till the ipl gets over because Indian players are going straight to Australia from here.. If everyone stays it would be nice to have all 8 teams at the finals. Since thiers no spectators, the cricketers for a change could become spectators",39
Basically the pattern is hype up a team and they lose and ridicule a team and they win!,14
"Dhoni is CSK lol, he 100% has to play. The IPL cycle is ending next year before the mega auction so it will be a good send off for CSK‚Äôs old guard.",12
Is Kuldeep Yadav not good enough for the XI? surely he's better than mavi or nagarkoti,5
"KXIP was a fun team to watch but :-  
1) the short run which wasn't a short run + super over in their first game   
2) Benching Gayle for a long time (even before his illness)   
3) Rahul's statpadding
  
caused their downfall",18
Wanted Punjab to win just so one of DC and RCB get knocked out. Would have been entertaining either way. But now it‚Äôs more or less impossible,5
"Star with an absolute cringe Alvida to CSK, lmao",-3
This hurts more than losing all 14 matches,6
"KL Rahul was the Bear Cartel for KXIP.  
  
Made himself rich with runs but caused a KXIP crash more often than not",4
Dhoni should become coach / mentor for CSK. That's where he can contribute immensely and not be a drag.,18
Why Punjab why !! Garam karke thanda chhod Diya,20
"KxiP:

The Match is over, The point is gone,

Thought I'd something more to play.",3
"So finally CSK has rang KXIPs Death Knell. Fantastic run KXIP so close, yet so far!",5
Just can't escape the pain as an RCB fan; both RCB and ex-RCB on a losing run. :(,16
MI Fans  rn: No one fears me but that team coughs RR coughs fear me xD,12
Can Gurkeerat pls do what hooda did today,11
they look so happy fr,3
Imagine getting 1 lakh rupees for just 4 sixes. Can send a kid to school for many years with that kind of money,15
Has there ever been a situation when the 1st ipl match of the match took so long to complete the 2nd match started late?,5
"Man, that one short run against DC really hurt KXIP..",10
Wait. Where's the post match presentation? I wanted to see what dhoni had to say before exiting this IPL .,9
KL iS InDiA's BEsT t20 bTtsMaN He hAs thE oRaNgE CaP.,8
That was brutal lol,4
"So unless we fuck up the 49 way, we're into playoffs?",18
MI vs RR final is what we need,11
Dhoni just said all teams except Mumbai have been trash üòù,39
Love the shade Dhoni is throwing against all teams,21
King Archer üëë: Legend of the pace,3

Archer is black dale steyn,-8
"0(1) vs RCB

0(1) vs KXIP

87(61) vs CSK

0(1) vs RR

Rana's last five innings, from Cricbuzz.",29
Lol MSD is doubling down on Gaikwad-Covid-3Weeks-Fitness-Practice thing.,14
To all my Physics bros out there. Will Archer be able to tap into the speed force if he removes his ornaments?,26
