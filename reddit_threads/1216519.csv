Never thought we wud be underdogs against Rcb,5
"According to KKR's social media accounts, Russell will play today. DK hinted that he might not bowl, so KKR will miss his death bowling.

On the other hand, Narine might be rested as 1. He will 100% get tonked in Sharjah, and 2. He was reported for a suspect action after the last match, so he might want to take some time off and work on it.

If Narine is rested, Chris Green might get a look in as KKR will play two spinners, or they could forgo that option and play Lockie Ferguson, which would be exciting as he will partner Cummins with the new ball.",1
PTSD attack,7
I'm panicking already,41
"So many happy memories against Rcb

Starting with baz 158*

49 all out

105 in powerplay

Rusell alone chasing 50 in 2 overs last year

Just hoping this one wud be as juicy",10
so who comes in for Narine? Green or Ferguson?,2
Is Russell fit ?,1
Moral Victory if we dont lose spectacularly,79
"Just let Russell open and let him top edge everything for 50m sixes, that's all I'm asking for.",45
"This will be one of the highest scoring ipl games ever or ludicrously underwhelming

No in-between",20
Sure would like to see Philippe in for Finch. It hurt my little heart watching Finch look so out of form last match. Reminded me of how he was batting during that horrible 2018/19 period he had across all formats.,9
Won't be surprised if KKR send out McCullum to open to get the mental edge,62
" DC will win he tournament. Saying as a RCB Fan: 

I have been highly successful in life being cocky. It’s better than being under confident if you want my take on things.

Regarding DC, they should run away with the tournament but the management is really questionable at times so I doubt it. This is a better DC team for example:

Stoinis (Shaw is super unreliable) Dhawan Rahane Iyer Pant Hetmyer Axar Ashwin Nortje Rabada Ishant Sharma

I don’t see this team losing too many games despite Iyer who doesn’t use his strike bowlers before the match the over.

But oh well, it is what it is.",0
My money on KKR today,5
"Could we see Banton today? There's a chance that Narine won't play, so maybe drop Nagarkoti for Kuldeep (gulp). We'll need a lot of batting firepower today.",8
Is there any reason that finch doesnt performs for any ipl franchise? Hes been so good for aus in t20is but performs horribly in ipl. And also keeping in mind that hes been an international player for so long and almost plays the same bowlers in international cricket. And hes a regular in t20is also means that he plays on all sorts of pitches and conditions. Is it bcz he takes too much pressure on himself for performing in such a big league?,12
"Moeen should be tried as an opener instead of Finch.

Despite Kohli’s success in 2016 as an opener, I feel he should stick to number 3. That’s where he seems most comfortable for himself and the team.",1
"If KKR win this match, there will be a strong three-way fight among RCB, SRH & RR for the coveted 4th place in the play-offs. Of course there could be a major shake-up of the standings also if CSK & Punjab play flawless Cricket from here on out.",2
"[Pitch report](https://www.iplt20.com/video/216261/m28-rcb-vs-kkr-pitch-report?tagNames=indian-premier-league,Latest)

Sharjah's pitch is slowing down.",3
"Every time rcb loses their openers early, the whole team collapses. So the best option would be to get Parthiv for finch, not only because finch is out of form but also because Parthiv can really anchor the innings even if wickets fall early. That would leave a vacancy for an international player so they can get Phillipe for lower order",8
Are there any good cricket games? If not can't we just have one?? I am sick and tired of just moving across my stumps and smashing everything on the leg side on Cricket 19,10
"Remember the first ipl match where Bangalore has test greats like Dravid, Sunil Joshi, Misbah ulhaq, Wassim Jaffer and Chanderpaul..",41
"For people who are saying Narine won't play - He is placed in the warning list by ICC because of a suspected illegal bowling action, but is permitted to continue to bowl. 

So technically he is still allowed play but whether or not his team would want him to is a doubt.",10
Star Sports' pre-match shows are so shit and migraine-inducing that I actually miss Extraaa Innings.,7
"The winner of this game is gonna have the same no of pts as MI and DC, despite not being anywhere near as dominating as they are and steamrolling other teams the way they are doing, especially MI.",27
Could Green and Banton get a look in? KKR fans help me out a bit,2
"Honestly RCB are one of the most entertaining teams to watch. When winning it's either due to contributions from Kohli or AB or both, which is blockbuster entertainment. And while losing(especially when defending a target) Kohli cam is hilarious.",125
Was unable to enjoy Kohli's masterclass last match. I hope he does another one today,6
"Guys,do you think Shane warne would be highest wicket taker as a spinner if he played all the seasons?",3
"Been a rough day today, hoping this makes some of it go away, Go RCB!",7
"I had forgotten what a beautiful player Virat Kohli was until last match.

An obligatory - Fuck you, Corona!",8
"I'm scared RCB will lose this and next thing you know, there will be 10 cricinfo articles saying ""to qualify, RCB needs to win 4/5 of their games while SRH loses to MI then MI loses to RR and Rohit Sharma wins the purple cap"" or some shit. I have PTSD from running these calculations for literally years.",64
"Tom Banton gets the cap

KKR opener making his IPL debut vs RCB

Where have I seen this before?",53
Bantons playing,7
Excited for Banton. Hopefully he will not disappoint.,1
"I hope they rest Russel today, for his own health of course.",26
"Tom banton opening, stoked!",2
So are they going to send Tripathi down the order again? Banton is best while opening especially in T20s.,3
"Just hoping KKr opens with one of the most destructive opener currently instead of doing what Rcb did with Philipe 

So happy for Tommy banton",2
It would be interesting to see if Russell has found a workaround to the wide yorker line that the bowlers have been bowling to him. Has definitely struggled due to that.,1
"Great news for KKR, banton is playing today",3
Gonna be Cummins' day today.,2
Young Banton's day todayyyyyyyyyy!!!!!!,1
"My batting line up will be

Banton
Tripathi
Gill
Then the floaters",6
I hope that Banton doesn’t open instead of Tripathi.,1
"After this match, transfer window will be opened. I sense that pp is going to get transferred",1
RCB won the toss and decided to win,13
Damn Kohli is on fire with the tosses.,23
oh yeah hoping for a finch blitz today,8
"Been watching IPL 2019 to catch up this year, russell is fun to watch, muscle man",4
Siraj is playin,5
"Kohli must be the most exciting batsmen active right now. 

Even his running between the wicket set r/cricket on fire in last match.",9
"""~~Dad~~ Baz told me  it's okay to lose the toss""",8
"What's the playing XI for both the teams, hotstar is showing highlights instead of the toss for some reason",1
Kohli is not going to win a single toss in Australia. He used up all his toss charm in IPL,4
"I hate both r
RCB AND KKR but I will support KKR for baz",-11
Another night being sad watching Finch struggle 😔,5
Happy that Banton is playing. More excited that Mohammed Siraj is playing!!! :D,1
Siraj is playing. Expect him to take Russell's wicket lmao.,4
"We don't have a decent middle order batter after AB, so Siraj comes in makes sense",6
"What kind of response is ""you can read our press statement""? Lol",11
"Royal Challengers Bangalore (Playing XI): Devdutt Padikkal, Aaron Finch, Virat Kohli(c), AB de Villiers(w), Washington Sundar, Shivam Dube, Chris Morris, Isuru Udana, Navdeep Saini, Mohammed Siraj, Yuzvendra Chahal",2
"""I think our bowlers are doing well so we decided  to bring in Siraj""

in all seriousness I hope he does well",13
oh no our lucky charm gurkeerat is out,6
Bangalore batting first. Expect 180 on this ground,1
Siraj is back on the menu in sharjah,3
Imagine not playing a single ball for 3 matches and then getting dropped for Siraj lmaooo,14
Before we start shitting on Siraj                                                        Siraj's Previous game against Delhi- 2-34 Best Bowler for them,3
"Kolkata Knight Riders (Playing XI): Rahul Tripathi, Shubman Gill, Nitish Rana, Eoin Morgan, Dinesh Karthik(w/c), Tom Banton, Andre Russell, Pat Cummins, Kamlesh Nagarkoti, Prasidh Krishna, Varun Chakravarthy",6
Siraj might score his first 50 of IPL today,3
Feel like this is Koach's year. He has been winning the toss quite often and has a decent team to work with this year. RCB might win this year's IPL.,7
"If y'all felt bad for Kishan, spare a thought for Gurkeerat.",10
"KKR are a bowler short, RCB are a bowler too many smh",3
What a shitty program,0
I hope we get kkr out for 49,8
"The stupidest change I have ever seen, why on Earth did we need Siraj, especially in the Chinnaswamy look-alike... Atleast Gurkeerat could smash a few if needed.",5
Please Koach do a 2016,2
"RCB going with the extra bowler and KKR with the extra bat, so it all comes to down to how many banton can score of siraj really...",2
"KKR added a batsman to improve their batting.

RCB added a bowler to improve KKRs batting",13
"Is kohli trolling Gurkeerat? In last press conference, Kohli said that Gurkeerat would allow RCB to a have deep batting line up but has again dropped him this match.",5
"Wait. So, who is our 5th Bowler? The injured Russell?

Or the wicket taker Rana??",2
Either 49 below or 250+ no in between,1
[deleted],1
Narine out due to the reported suspect bowling action?,2
Russel vs Siraj would be interesting,3
"RCB win rate with Gurkeerat Singh Mann- 100%

RCB win rate without Lord Mann- 33.3%

Looks like the game is over bois :(",37
"KKR are gonna loose today, They  had replaced Rana with Mavi Or a specialist  Bowler going with only 5bowling option with Kamlesh and varun 230plus score coming",-1
Here for Koach special like last match,2
Where is Tripathi gonna bat? No. 7?,2
Anything less than 230 I can't think of 🤔💭with this bowling line up come on RCB,2
Just here to watch Virat bat.,4
Siraj was brought back to get Russell back into form. The script writers demanded it /s,16
Serious pressure on Narine now. He’s been replaced. Probably so that he can prove the legitimacy of his action. He might have reverted to his old action in the previous game because he bowled in the death overs. He rarely if ever bowled in the death overs using his remodeled action.,2
lmao dropped match winner Narine,0
So just wanna confirm that Narine will bowl again after proving his action as valid in the bowling academy or something?,2
Banton plays. [I get my wish!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/j98ndx/these_players_will_be_eligible_to_change_teams/g8ii2w7/) Now watch him get out cheaply.,2
Banton is going to get eaten alive by this thread if he fields as badly as he does for England and the Heat lol,5
KKR needs to win this match as they will be having a mandatory loss in the next match,5
"WTF is this

1 team going with 6 batsman 4 bowlers n 1 not 100% rusell

Other playing with 4 batsman 6 bowler n 1 bits n pieces",5
Why the fuck do you bring a batting line-up with dubey/sundar at 5 on the highest scoring ground of the season. It's a ticking timebomb.,3
Koach winning most of the tosses... I am loving 2020.,4
"For the first time since 2016, I am a bit tensed in a RCB vs KKR game. They have been a really good side this season.",2
"Banton is only playing because I consumed copious amounts of cider last night as a sacrifice to the Somerset gods

You're all welcome",11
KKR going in with 5 bowling options including a half-fit Russel is...brave,5
Hope it's another Kohli show,3
Can Banton bowl ?,1
KKR'S bowling looks very unstable after dropping Narine. This can prove risky. They should have played Chris Green instead.,5
"So Narine had to pull out that Masterclass Death Bowling performance with the Illegal action against Kxip lmao.

Talk about bad luck",-1
i dont think an extra bowler will do much good here but hope for the best,2
Which position Banton will bat today?,1
"You can’t simply “remove” one of your best bowlers and hope that the team plays as well. Losing Narine will turn out to be a huge blow to KKR. Just as losing Bhuvi is to SRH. If MI loses Bumrah or if DC loses Rabada or if RR loses Archer, things won’t be the same no matter what. It’s always a tough situation for the management.",1
"For everyone who is thinking can banton bowl? 

No, because he's a WK batsman.",8
RCB putting a lot of faith on the batting of sundar and dube.,6
"RCB's batting is a ticking time bomb. Only Virat, Abd and somewhat Padikkal are reliable. The fact that Sundar/Dube are your number 5 is a suicide strategy.",12
Can Banton play as a finisher? I've always seen him play as an opener.,2
Koach and his RTG has cost us before.,2
"In his last match, Virat Beast Kohli ran 50 of his 90\*.",2
Expecting KKR to fuck up their batting order today again. Banton at no. 7 incoming.,4
"Just going to point out that it's extremely coincidental that Narine was pretty average post his action change, and the second he's back to his best he gets reported for a dodgy action. Fairly certain he went back to a variation of the old action to give kkr the best chance in those last 2 games.",1
Its okay to drop Narine as he will be suddenly on the radar of Umpires & Match Referee which will affect his game. But replacing him with a batsman seems like a wrong choice. I feel on this ground even 4 batsmen can win you the match. Its the bowling options you are gonna need when runs start to flow. You cant win 3 consecutive times based on your luck.,3
We're back in Chinnaswamy boys!,7
I hope we don't sleepwalk for 35 overs and then hope the other team chokes,10
Finch should have not played ..he might struggle,4
I have a bad feeling that Banton is going to disappoint. I don't want him to but I can feel it. It is very difficult for those English batsman to click in their first ipl match.,6
Any idea how long Narine will take to “prove his innocence” and when he’ll be playing again,8
Damn all these teams flexing with 2 wks when we are using Ab,30
"Nitish Rana once got AB and Kohli out in consecutive balls two years back. Wonder if anyone else has done that in IPL history lol.

https://www.iplt20.com/video/116273/virat-and-abd-in-the-bag-rana-s-double-delight",13
I'm slightly afraid for Varun. Sure I've not seen anything suspicious about his action but there's a long precedent of mystery spinners having suspect action. I hope he doesn't overdo and come into the radar.,1
"Baz works in mysterious ways , how tf are we supposed to take on RCB with that bowling line up .With Ferguson on the bench Banton is not a good choice.",1
Swann is drunk already,1
"RCB with just 4 proper batsmen. Dube, Sunder and Morris have a lot of work to do if the top fails.",5
Just asking what is this meaning of suspect action? Is it violating the rules of bowling? I dont know abt the rules so can anyone tell me??,3
[deleted],4
"Only successful chase at Sharjah so far has been by RR when Lord Tewatia did the miracle against KXIP. 

In all other matches the team batting first has won.",6
What's up with Kuldeep? Is he injured?,2
Man KKR look so strong with bat. RCB have to release the Kraken to get through this! 230+ please..,8
Can someone explain to me why we still don't have any video analysis on why Narine was reported? It's freaking 2020 and there are cameras everywhere,13
"RCB has a long tail really, imagine few quick wickets at the start",8
"F for gurkeerat, got dropped without batting or bowling",26
"Narine's warning seems like

When u cant play him, ban him",7
"Honestly, fuck these loser umpires. They have been shit all tournament. Now they don't even let KKR know which ball Narine was reported for? Absolutely ridiculous. Unfortunately, BCCI tosses off these umpires and you can't say anything about them so KKR is stuck with no recourse.",10
Mannnnn what the fuck? RCB are playing with 6 specialist bowlers and one dude who is neither good at batting or bowling (Dube). They're gonna be so fucked if they lose early wickets lol. Pretty crazy.,0
"Why do we have Lord Siraj in the squad

 **Confused Screaming**",6
I would pay to see Swann high on bhang,5
KKR has just 4 bowlers. Confused,1
Usually how many wins are required to solidify in the top 4?,3
The idea of KKR chasing 200 against RCB kind of haunts me. Probably because of Robbie’s match-winning 9(20) last year.,9
6 specialist bowlers vs 4 specialist bowlers,2
any news on Russel's injury? will he be able to bowl?,3
KKR needs DreRuss to fire with the bat,5
Meanwhile Ashish Nehra is getting ready to preach his theory of length delivery.,12
Sucks that they aren't even saying anything about Narine,2
"Is Mavi injured or what? 

Nagarkoti leaks runs esp when u dont have backup",1
Good to see that we are backing Finch. About time we put our trust into a quality player. Let's see if it pays off,3
So Banton is opening?,1
Not having Narine could hit KKR where it hurts.,2
I have a bad feeling about this match,3
"I think 180-190 would be chaseable. Anything above that would be tough against a bowling lineup consisting of Morris, Sundar and Saini. Both the teams would have to target the opponent's fifth bowler properly.",1
"Gurkeerat Mann is expert in getting cucked by IPL teams. 36 matches in 8.5 years.

Did Not Bat: 9 times

3-5: 11 innings

6-8: 16 innings",2
"KKR Random Team Generator is up and kicking. 

Good omen for us.",3
We are having just 4 bowlers and an all rounder in the worst place for bowlers this IPL. Doesn't look nice...,2
I have a bad feeling about this,3
No matter what the result would be but brilliant move by Koach as he now has 7 bowling options & Karthik only 5,2
"Man, Tripathi is gonna have to play at 7 again. As excited as I am to see Banton open, it feels cruel to fuck with Tripathi like that.",7
Match Thread already on front page nice,6
Who were your favorite fast bowlers while growing up?,2
TOM BANTON IS PLAYING!! I've loved watching him at Somerset over the last few years so I am fully expecting him to shit the bed in this one match and then never be selected for an IPL game ever again,7
Does Tripathi bowl?,1
"The new team means that Dre Russ has to bowl all 4 overs. Hopefully he holds up, especially after the injury last game",3
"Oops Banton is fielding, hope he does well",1
"2 questions
What's the rule that Narine was warned under ?



Why are bowlers not allowed to bowl greater than a certain angle when batsmen can do all sorts of things like switching and reverse sweeps ?",5
Do or die match for Finch,2
The fact that we've beaten the first placed team and lost to the last placed team is peak rcb,24
I would have picked Moeen for Finch. KKR have no offies and they have two left handed middle order batsmen as well.,1
"**Aaron Finch v Pat Cummins in T20s**

Finchy didnt accidentally put the lead boots on today,4
What a flick by Finch,4
"I feel DreRuss would be comfortable bowling only the 18th and 20th overs rather than 4 overs..too much workload and pressure on him.. Baffling decision yet again by DK, but still it's DK and we know what happened in their last two matches !!",1

Lmao finch used more footwork there than the entire season,43
Nothing more dominating than walking and hitting a fast bowler like cummins,7
Finch is finally moving.,8

"RCB fans seeing their team doing well.

Dafuq does much of muchness mean KP.,6
It must be so satisfying to be allowed to bowl chin music at your national team captain,7

"Finch coming down , and we don't have Narine ಠಿヮಠ",5

Do the umpires have a bone to pick with haaRCB?,4

KKR got Prasidh Krishna as a replacement player a couple years ago. He bowls in the mid 140s. Are there any Indian players who haven’t been sold but can still bowl in the 140s? Bhuvi’s replacement has already been selected though.,3
They blowing away KKR today for sure,5

Oh sorry - DDP! Mr. Padikkal saar""",4
Guys please vote the match thread so it's easier to find,7
It seems like it's going to be a long night for KKR and KKR's bowlers.,4
Pat Cummins this year IPL stats are shit compared to Archer Rabada Bumrah considering he's got twice the money those guys are making,15
We looking at 250?,3
Here I am wanting both the teams to good,3
Paddikal or prithvi shaw or shubam gill?,4
"How was Narine reported for suspect action but Krunal isn't? Multiple times this year, he's bowled with that shithouse action",6
"I feel like the high scores in Sharjah are kind of a mental thing.

Padikkal would never have charged Cummins like this, and Finch wouldn’t have gone for that 6 off of Prasidh if it wasn’t for the expectation that they will pull it off.

Also, batsmen go for more 6’s because of the short boundaries but half of them end up on the road so would be sixes at the other grounds too !",26
Left hander hits boundary: Aakash Chopra - Yuvraj's six sixes,4
Comms back at it again; comparing the left hander to Yuvraj,5
Uhh wait wasn't that two bouncers in the over??,9
Finch is pissed because they aren't serving KFC at Sharjah,9
cummins is such a beast,4
How is he allowed two bouncers,9
"That's the issue with Padikkal. Beautiful boundaries, but can't seem to find the singles and doubles. Surely Kohli can help him with this",4
so good to see rcb playing fearlessly,6
Kya plan heeee,2
So how does insurance cover the dent if a ball would hit a car. Stadiums insurance?,6
Easy game for Cummins if he can just roll in and bowl bouncers over the batsman's head like that..,6
This Kingfisher ad is lame af,2
"So what's the pitch playing like, is the slow nature gonna come into play?",1
"If Cummins doesn’t get a wicket today, KKR are in huge trouble",0
"Wait, what? Are there two bouncers per over now? Especially when they look like they go over the head?",11
What's with all the bouncers,1
Sharjah imitating Bangalore traffic to make RCB feel at home,41
The average powerplay score at Sharjah this IPL is 54.,7
AB is gonna love this ground,13
Cummins has never taken more than 2 wickets in an innings in IPL.,10
Umpires are fucking useless.,6
Shut up cummo. Otherwise DDP will DP you. /s,0
"This is how we gotta bowl ,well done prasiddh",5
Ooooooh another local boi is sledging Aussie captain. What are you doing blore boys!!! 😳🔥🔥,5
someone hit the six out of the park to get this traffic moving,7
These two have already played more dot balls in 3 overs than Kohli did in his ENTIRE last innings,59
"Ali Khan would be much more handier for KKR. He bowled really well in CPL, PSL & other leagues. Hope he is tried out.

Great comeback after those boundaries. Quality cricket!,2
This season: Paddikal>Gill,17
Padikkal obviously.,8
Sunny G and Akash Chopra commentating together and throwing slack at Cummins and Finch. smh,5
Didn't understand the logic of selecting 1d Mavi over tried and tested Prasidh earlier,1
Oh shot man,5
What a fucking shot,6
"RCB has to think about the long run and bring in a Keeper ASAP. 

Imagine RCB qualifying for Playoffs and ABD getting injured just before the playoffs. Then they'd be truly fucked.",4
Fetch that prasidh.,6
Lol that was a mini helicopter,2
How many balls are lost on average per game at this ground?,5
So does Tripathi get sacrificed down the order once again?,2
Shot Boi.,1
Any non indian here?or everyone here are indians?,5
definitely Padikkal so far,8

Not bad this DDP lad.,10
That's a signature Sanath Jayasuriya smashing Prasad at Sharjah shot 😁,4

Little helicopter flick,6
I just want RCB to crush KKR today pls,24
Poor line,3
Take a shot everytime someone says youngster.,4
Lol why they bowling at the pads,2
Look at the flick of da wrist,11
Shame for Kohli not many 2s here,21
padikkal has like a super model build bet he can strut,12
I am falling in love with Padikkal's shots.,6
Damn paddikal show Some mercy son,5
I hope this Padikkal kid is legit and doesn't turn out to be like those one season IPL wonders like we've had before.. He could be a great find for India especially with Dhawan coming towards the end of his career in the next couple of years.,44
We bat deep tonight. RCB has to score 200 at the minimum.,9
Lol! This ground is a joke.,5
Dhawan should be very scared seeing Paddikal in this form!,8
"Those who didn't follow Indian cricket in 90s, this is how Anwar and Jayasuriya hurt our precious bowlers at Sharjah 😔",11
"finch is probably whispering ""foot movement, foot movement"" to himself",23

Why isn't the score not going up?,4
Shades of Yuvi in leg side boundaries by Padikkal.,11
Imagine gayle here,9
Excited to see Banton play tonight!,5
How many chewing gum does finch have with him,7
Sharjah - the economy wrecker,8
3 overs for Cummings?,2
Am i hallucinating or is the score not updating?,5
aussie and karnataka pair opening the batting and bowling,13
"Swann : As easy as taking candy from a baby.

Terry : Why are you giving candy to a baby? They can't brush their teeth!",8
Prasidh and Nagarkoti have been underwhelming. Russell is a part timer. Chakravarthy has been okish. Cummins has to get a wicket soon or RCB will blast off,-1
Someone like a Kohli or AB could absolutely destroy KKR here,4
"So KKR have 4 bowlers + Russell & Rana but they're using 3 Cummins overs up front?

Brave.",10

"I like how everytime Mark Nicholas speaks, you go back to the golden era of playing EA cricket. Noice.",24
Cummins already bowling 3rd woah also no Narine today,6
What a buttery shiny pitch,12
Sounds sweet of Padikkal's bat,3
He said the Y word describing Padikkal. He has to put a dollar in the jar.,10
Crowd noise is actually much better now compared to the start of the tournament,76
Count (Yuvraj singh) = 14,11
Cumdog's finally figured Padikkal out..,8
Range™,5
Pitch looks ready to ten pin bowl on. Shiny,7
It's just lovely that Cummins can crank it upto to 150.,7
40 in 5 overs on this pitch is so average,3
KKR may be slaughtered today in death overs with no Naraine and Cummins almost bowling out his quota.,3
Great CUMback from CUMdog,3
RCB are gonna fk KKR at the death here,4
Oye DCP!!,0
"Not the worst PP so far, obviously no wicket, but anything less than 10 an over is good",6
Great over from Pat,1
"What is this shit show?!!

Need 60 by the end of the Powerplay",5
Why tf are commentators whining that Cummins is being used in the powerplay? That's where he's best at and that's where he should be used. Just because they paid 15 cr for him doesn't mean he should be used at the death lmao.,2
[deleted],0
KKR needs wickets,1
Why does DK generally bowl out Cummins?,1
Who tf will bowl at the death? BoseDK himself?,2
Sanjay Bangar is the human version of the fake  crowd noise,2
Mukund in dugout now?,2
19 runs in 3 overs!! Not bad Cummins.,5
Kapil Dev : Padikkal kya marre bsdk,5
"Having seen Banton play well in big bash , I’m excited to see him go at it here",1
Indian leftie plays a flick. Commentators  : *OMG is that Yuvraj singh?*,7
"Padikkal hits a boundary and then 2 dots, I think we saw that yesterday",2
KKR is gonna get smacked in the death overs why use 3 overs of Cummins so early,5
Padikkal seems to be a very classical batsman and hits a lot more 4’s than 6’s. He actually reminds me of an early career Rahane. I mean this in a good way. Rahane was more aggressive in 2011-2013 and played many such innings at the top as Padikkal is doing now.,8
Alr can see Banton fk RCB here,2
So will Banton be opening or can he play in the middle order? I've only seen him opening,1
Lmao i feel like McCullum is trying to make everyone chutiya by pretending to be busy and writing something in his notebook every time the camera pans on him..,12
Let’s go EXPO ooooOOoOOOOOOOO,2
No spin bowler in Powerplay how will Sundar bowl today,1
Wait all the Leftie's have reminded us of Yuvi Paaji?                       *Always Has Been*,3
Lol! RCB are playing with only 4 batsmen.,2
Finch really slowing down :(,4
Committee seeing Narine's action : idk its kinda sus,12
Ok Brian Lara and Abhinav Mukund... couple of superstars. This is way too much Brett Lee ..,2
Russel checking if finch is coming down the track or not,1
Two completely opposite strategies on show here. RCB is playing with 4 batsmen and stacked up on bowlers/bowling all rounders. KKR's opted for batdeep with Banton instead of Narine.,7
Is Green available? Ain't he the perfect swap for Narine being an Offie and a decent Bat?,1
Russell to break down after bowling 2 overs calling it,1
Russell can give his life for KKR. I thought he won't be even playing today.,8
"If Russel gets injured while bowling tonight, KKR have no one but themselves to blame",5
Russell's runup looks like a medium pacer yet he bowls 140,8
"A 100 from Kohli today, y’all heard it here first",1
Banton had expressed a desire to play for Mumbai last year. I was also hoping we would rope him in. I was very disappointed when we didn't even bid for him. He's a very promising talent,-1
RCB's kit uses Gold in the best away amongst all IPL kits,8
"   
**Harsha Bhogle:** I would have thought that KKR would have been told which deliveries by Sunil Narine were deemed to be a problem. They might have been able to play him without him bowling those problem deliveries.",3
Why does Russell have to run? Just stand and rotate your arm.,3
"The *F*inch *F*oot *F*etish at display

Alliteration 💯",3
Never realised the legacy Yuvraj left. Every left hander is compared to him.,7
The camera angles have been pretty annoying so far.,2
"For marathi folks: Andre la bowling ani batting dya nahitar Andre Rusel 

T: Give Andre Russel both batting or bowling or he will feel bad.",2
Oh you bastard,4
Hope Dre Russ can bowl his quota,2
Oi ya bastard,8
BASTARD,5
why tf you playing only 4 batters smh,2
Prithvi Shaw is hands down the most talented young batsman in India period.,3
137. What's up with finch?,1
RCB really needa get going,1
Shit that ball brought back nightmares,1
Damn how does Russell bowl so well,2
6 incoming,3
We need a 6 now.,2
[removed],-2
"Before over hyping any youngsters, people should take a moment, and remember Unmukt Chand.",12
"Russel became decent with the ball when Was Akram was KKR's bowling coach, he used to bowl a lot of pies when he played for Delhi",1
"""Oi you bastard."" Anyone else expecting a deeper Finch voice ?",8
How tf is dre russ bowling so good?,1
Is Karnataka cricket taking over Mumbai cricket?,5
"Commentators overexaggerate everything like crazy. ""Amazing Finch, today"". He is at 19 of 17 balls, in Sharjah in Powerplay.
That's really poor!!!",4
I am confused about who won the power play.,2
Fuck was that dropped?,2
Dre russ is mvp,2
ya barstard,3
Russell and  Pollard's run ups have the same energy,2
“Oh you bastard” Finch when deceived by Dre Russ haha,7
Fuck me what was that,2
Every short ball is above shoulder. Is the ump blind?,3
LMFAO!,2
"How Russell, with his laundry list of niggles, injuries, and straight up broken body parts, bowls 140+ is beyond me.",4
Oi you bastard. - A. Russell after that drop.,7
Russell's bowling skills are lot better for someone who is mostly known for their batting abilities..,6
Russell did all the hard work for nothing smh.,6
Going at less than 8 an over on this pitch is criminal,6
Shithouse,4
Good strategy not getting Finch's wicket,11
Finch doesn't seem like a specialist batsman.. looks like somebody RCB sent as a pinch hitter to hit or get out,4
Don't dare to fool thick boi Finch with a slower one unless you want to be called Oi you bastard,5
"There goes Finchy's first life, we've got 3 more, right?",10
"Yuvraj was definitely the most iconic indian lefthander. 

Gambhir would come second.",11
Omg. Get ready to be punished big time.,1
Finch allows too many dot balls and then pressure builds,4
Kohli would be fuming on all these dot balls,12
"KKR knows it’s not prudent to replace Finch with Kohli, tactical catch drop",3
Maan they immediately switch to the commercial. I wanna see that catch he dropped.,1
"Dropped by one of the better fields in the team, Nagarkoti!",1
"I don't see us going past 230, so don't think we have a chance today",6
Why did KKR even buy so many foreign bowlers in the auction.,2
Who was the person saying they shouldn't judge T20 batsmen so quickly? Finch almost had a bog standard 19(17) innings again.,2
every team except mumbai is fielding like shit this season,1
Brian Lara doesn’t age? Ehh?,2
RCB playing safe because they have only 4 batsmen.,3
[deleted],3
That was about to be such an excellent over.,5
"What would be the good point for ABD to come in?

Edit- ABD instead of ADB",2
Poor poor fielding. That was a dolly,3
"finch, ur shit

&#x200B;

pls prove me wrong",6
"Respectable start by both. One has not given many runs, other has not given many wickets.",3
"Bloody hell, Simon Doull gets paid 150,000 less than KP for the same job.",5
Finch will do some damage now.,6
I have a feeling that catch is going to bite them in ass.,6
okayish powerplay. They need to smack the spinners.,2
Ok boys let's up the gears,1
Finch has been the luckiest batsman till now in IPL. No other batsman had as many lives as him.,2
"Alright power play from kkr considering the size of the Sharjah, once Cummins adapted to hold them to less than 8rpo is not terrible",1
8 run rate at Sharjah?? in super over?!?!,1
Russell has been our best bowler this season,2
Playing test in Sharjah. just Arcb Things.,2
They should get atleast 225 here,4
moeen playing today?,1
Wtf is Abhinav Mukund doing in Duggout??,1
Throuuuuuughhhhhhhh NagarKOTI,1
~~I~~IIIIIIII finch's one life has been crossed out. 8 to go,2
Pitch looks great. I'm not sure why the openers are being ultra conservative. Is it because of them only having 4 batsmen? Pretty idiotic team selection if that's the case.,0
"Have a  feeling today is the day, Russell will fire with the bat. RCB winning the match for 35 overs, just to lose it in the last 5 overs due to Russell",4
I heard Johnson&Johnson is coming to KKR,0
"Finch bad finch bad finch bad

Now bullied on reddit, pls play good",5
Yeah I feel Finch is gonna murder the spinners,1
[Finch just now](https://youtu.be/Tzros3vWmXQ),2
Who the hell is that Indian dude in the dug out?,5
Koach just shed a tear,8
"Lmao seeing these kkr fans trying to reverse jinx hard here. Calm down, you have an amazing batting depth and can chase easily anything below 240 against this bowling lineup",5
Nehra betichod length balls ain't that good and no playing sensibly won't do fuck all,10
Heart skips a beat when finch calls for two.,9
Padikkal is statpadding again,2
KKR fielding is shit. No one seems to have a sense of urgercy.,2
Chakravarthy really does look like an architect who just decided to put on some sweats and bowl right arm whatever,8
6.5 bowler strategy to 4.5 bowler strategy. McCullum rolls the dice before selecting his 11 lol.,4
Fielding lmao,4
That's 4,3
Finch looks below par,1
Fucking hell,3
VILLAGE LOL,7
U19 fielding bad?,5
4,1
Bruh absolute state of fielding from Indian youngsters over the past 2 days.,4
That's awful,2
Gill has been very lousy at the ropes. That's just so so so sad. Disappointing.,1
Fielding is dog shit in this year IPL,4
Lol Sara ke papa na mana kar diya!,8
That’s a four,4
Gill so vulgar,4
Guilty shubman gill. That's 4,6
"Oh what the hell was that Gill? Did Koach enter the ""BUTTERFINGERS"" cheatcode before the match?",8
DK shouting Tamil XDD,7
It definitely moved,3
What is DK saying in Tamil?,7
Did Gill just say behnchod ?,7
What's DK saying in Tamil/Telugu lol?,5
KKR fielding to lose today I guess,3
Shaw's Under-19 team mates taking inspo from him,5
He got the ball then touched it lmaoo,5
Gill looks guilty fellas,7
Brain dead fielding,6
Doesn’t move but it touched for sure,7
"Russell has had a bad knee for several years now. Yet KKR play him regularly and he has hardly missed a game and still bowls around 140 km/h. On the other hand we have Bhuvi who has had persistent hip, thigh and back injuries and has missed several games for both SRH and India. And now he’s out again. Is it fair to hold the physios and management responsible for handling his fitness poorly?",7
Prithvi Gill,7
This is school level fielding,6
Gill following his U19 cap prithvi's footsteps,8
The pitch here is getting slow and people are like they need 235 lmaoo,3
Nice acting gill,6
Sunny ji just shut the fuck up,4
101 on How to convert possible catch to boundary,2
"We haven't picked up a wicket in the 1st 10 overs in the last 2 matches ,utter shit bowling there.",1
"Calling it 

Russell to break down before completing his quota of 4 overs.

Won't bat",5
Why are people surprised that Punjabis say BC all the time,4
That's a clear boundary. What the fuck is the third umpire looking at,6
The real rivalry is between Swann and 3rd umps,6
"Sab kuch touch ho gaya hai uska boundary line pe.

t: every part of his body has touched the boundary line",2
Imagine watching your shit fielding in slow mo over and over again on the big screen lmao,12
"These new Indian kids are a bit challenged in the field as compared to Kohli / Dhoni's generation, aren't they?",8
Fucking hell clearly moved. 1 replay was enough,7
Swann can be obnoxious whenever we go to the third umpire,2
Mark Nicholas with the dad jokes,2
"5 bowlers n this fielding 

We r fucked today

Only banton or rusell special can save us today",7
Swann is funny.,4
Sunny G telling about spirit of cricket. Remember his 37(181)*,20
Gill not disappointing his U19 captain Shaw with his boundary fielding in the last couple of matches,6
Sunny “I always walked” Gavaskar,12
That's four.,4
"Sunil ""spirit of cricket"" gavaskar",7
Nah he's shaking his head. I wouldn't have given it a 4.,1
"I don't know why but both Gill and Shaw seems to have some attitude. Compared to say Bumrah who is arguably the most well behaved cricketer I have seen to date, hope he doesn't break this character.",6
"DK: \~Don't think about the runs, he's gonna get out soon.",6
Why is he holding on to the ball there. Parry it back ffs. So poor fielding.,3
Leave him alone Sunny,1
Gill should start giving a shit about fielding. Hope the fame doesn't get to his head.,11
You can see the marker bulging... Sorry mate but that's gone.,3
Dk and varun talking in tamil,5
What happened to fielding standards? Even simple routine stuff is not so simple anymore,5
"

Finch is still playing ground shots.",1
🎶download cred baby🎶download cred🎶,5
Gill just cost KKR the fair play award. Punter will try to get him in DC next year.,9
‘credit to chakrabati for not letting himself get hit’ he’s gone for 9 off four balls lol,1
Doubt he knew tbh. He's worried about having fucked up at that point to feel the cushion.,3
I love sunny throwing curveballs aboit spirit of the game lol,4
Bruh runs are raining like hell. And KKR are bowler short what the hell,0
Shubman looked Gill-Ty,6
Expecting a 100 from Finchy today,4
Sunny extra drunk today,3
Padikkal is a Malluboi. He'll pick up what DK advised Varun I think.,5
Gill was only trying to download the cred app,5
not the best powerplay (esp for sharjah) but really good running between the wickets.,2
"Imagine if gayle played here, finch is subpar",3
Padikkal is a bit of a lazy runner,2
Padikkal seems to be a shy down to earth guy.,3
Rana time,1
Sunny G never fails to directly or indirectly push Mumbai boi Shaw by overexagerrating all possible faults in Gill / Paddikal and the like.,9
"Chakravarthy looks stoned everytime camera pans on him.

Wonder how will he look after actually getting high ?",5
Spirit of the Game... guess the Winchester boys found the bones and burned those.,2
rana's overs still to come. god help kkr today.,1
Mark with the dad jokes,1
Padikkal playing for his 50? Why isn't he firing?,2
"KKR needs a timeout.

They are looking sleepy in field.",3
What's this Sara meme I keep seeing in the KKR matches?,1
"Gurkeerat Singh's story is weird. 

Dint get picked for RCB's first 2 Games, Played 3rd and 4th games and din't Batted or Bowled. 

Got Dropped for the 5th game and brought back again for 6th Game and again dint Bat or Bowl and got dropped again for the 7th game.",10
DK shaved his beard and KKR's luck changed. Now that it has started growing out again the tides have turned against his team.,5
Go bersek next ABD should come. With KKR batting lineup of morgan and russel 220 is must.,6
"I feel 4 overs of nitish rana will be crucial today

Give him the ball u cowards",6
Top fielding,3
Get Ab in there.,1
What is up with KKR fielding?!,4
Abysmal fielding from kkr makes DC look good,10
Just signal it was 6 and save time man,9
How the fuck does Padikkal lose his grip on every shot,3
Competing for who can be the shittiest fielder,12
Luck is not on our side....neither are our players,17
“ Third umpire takes five minute to look at this”: Swann (lololol),34
"Awful lmao

Thanks Agent Prasidh",32
What? A better fielder would have caught that,1
Hit anywhere you like boys there is no one on the field,3
KKR converting catches and ones into boundaries,14
Graeme Swann is great,5
"As a KKR fan, KKR vs RCB is the most anticipated match.",9
"Lol, Swann is hilarious",7
Can we send Sunny outside the classroom?,3
"If each of the four bowlers go for 45 and Siraj leaks 60, RCB needs to score 241 to win. Quick maffs",5
Is Sunny becoming the new Sanju Manju ?,1
"My stream keeps fucking up but as denzel washington once said

You pray for rain, you gotta deal with the mud too",3
How many meters was that,1
Diamond dallas page on fire xdd,3
Swann is the best irl shitposter I’ve ever seen not even lying. He should stay in the Dugout every second of the match.,7
This commentary is fucking retarded right now,6
Why the fielders are not in the rope in a field like sharjah I don’t understand,2
Should've been a catch. Another one missed.,2
Could have been caught if he was on the fence,2
Don't be surprised if KKR loses this match because of their shit fielding.,9
Both were 16 off 11 and now both are 32 off 22.,18

I think Tv doesn't show it but Prasidh  come running from far to reach under the bowl. Not his fault,6
Dafuq are they doing? Smash!!,10
"Both batsmen at 32(22), and still dp looks more comfortable than Finch?!",5
Is chutiye Gavaskar ko chup karao,7
Feel bad for russell,5
Guided down to third man for a single after hitting a six. You don't need me to tell you what kind of cricket that is.,11
Is the ground even smaller than everyone says or is the camera angle all fucked up?,5
I think they've actually closed off that road that's directly outside the stadium. Smart move,3
WOOOO,2
Prolly for the best,6
Good Ball.,2
Damn son why’d you do that?,6
Shit shot from Padikkal,5
He looked like getting out like this,7
"Middle stump out of the ground

Is there a better sight",3
GET IN THERE,3
It's for the better.,4
Collapse™,2
Russel you beauty !,5
Are Sara and Gill official?,6
Fuck it Bring on Koach,5
STILL DRE DAY,5
Time for the Kohli show!,4
The old Kohli would've dropped Finch after the start he had to the tournament. Nice to see him given a long rope. Finch is a joy to watch in limited overs,14
Atleast we're way past 49.,4
That's the only way kkr can get wicket today,5
YEAH BOI!,2
“50s are overrated anyway” - Padikkal,57
"Russel is KKR's best bowler this season, isn't he?",3
Koach time ❤️❤️😍😍😍,7
Lol both these batsmen expecting the other to switch gears,2
"Bowled him

This shud have been 3rd wicket for rusell",3
"So basically this is like RCB playing at Chinnaswamy, not sure how I feel about that",2
"DDP gonna diamnond cutter Russel

edit: /r/agedlikemilk",1
Two more wickets and into the tail,0
"Timeout, that means Koach is gone first ball",3
"Dre Russ is such a match winner. He isn't doing it with the bat this year, but he's doing it with the ball. The real MVP!",3
"when no one is taking catches of your bowling, i guess that's what you do",2
Don't know if I should be upset about Padikkal getting out or be happy about Koach coming in.,6
Sunny G talking about spirit of the game. What hypocrisy? Sunny G was a great batsmen but an awful sportsman.,2
"**7.4** Russell to Padikkal, OUT, Russell says I will do it all myself. The stumps are splayed all over the place. Cross seam, full, straight. Padikkal makes room, swings and misses **67-1**

D Padikkal  b Russell 32 (23b 4x4 1x6) SR: 139.13",1
He played this exact shot twice to cummins..but gets out to russel?,6
Russell is actually a very good bowler this season.,3
"Russel said fuck it, I'll do this myself.",4
"DK completing Russell's quota ASAP 

Because he will be 'injured' once the drugs wear off",6
"RCB has had a good start but both openers didn’t really look at ease. Also KKR fielded pretty bad. A wicket was always on cards. 

Finch also seems like a sitting duck even after scoring so many runs.",6
[deleted],3
"""That, as they say, is middle stump""

Genuinely cannot stop laughing at that, he's such a bellend",7
"Ok, again, Russell is much better bowler than rated usually.",2
"Good bowling Russell , padikkal got unsettled by the bounce and decided to go all out rather than his usual watch and play approach",3
Sunny G was one of the best slip fielder we had. He knows what he is talking about unlike armchair experts here.,6
Sorry but DDP was getting a little overaggresssive. This was coming.,5
Greame swann was annoying as fuck,-3
"Despite what commentators say about fielders having to be honest about boundaries, I’ve found that third umpires always check even when fielders say what it was",12
"Kohli, Finch, Ab and Dube could be wankfest",1
I thought sunnyG said size of the bitches,2
Russell and Narine are the only wicket takers in kkr.,0
Russell says: *Y'all little shits won't take catches so I'll just clean him up*,11
Russell is a brilliant bowler.,3
We are gonna win padikkal crossed 10.,16
How did that work on Cummins but it failed on Russell?,5
"Padikkal simply gave his wicket away, was looking quite good with the bat today",4
Off topic: Why doesn't dream11 have virat kohli in their advertisements?,4
F for paddikal,3
Koach gonna score single digit,2
"**Average first innings scores by venue in this season of IPL**

**Sharjah - 212**

Dubai - 179

Abu Dhabi - 169",9
Koach time purple bitches,14
Dre Russ just quietly having a great bowling season in IPL.,12
Why was Sanju dropped from Comm box? due to his unpopularity with fans or because of his comments on current Indian players like Jadeja?,7
"Well deserved, it really is fucking well deserved",2
Russell vs DDP would be a good wrestling match too,2
AB next then into the tail :(,8
"I wonder if KL, Hardik, Iyer actually use boAt headphones",13
That was 300th T20 wicket for A Russell,5
"Man that lifeboy ad with Kolhi, ABD and Yuzi is next level cringe",35
Why do these umpires look so dead inside ?,4
Russell has that Archer vibe of jogging to the crease and bowling much faster than what the mind perceives from the run-up. Deceptive af.,2
Wonder if anyone in the Rajasthan camp has informed Warnie of his boyfriend's brilliant 1/162 against Qld today. Well bowled Riley Meredith.,2
We should be 10-15 runs lower if their fielding wasn't so shit,9
One with Sikhar Dhawan is the best Dream11 ad imo.,11
how come nagarkoti hasn't bowled yet? koach and abd will slaughter him.,6
A few 4s from kohli and we will be in for a treat today,5
Sunny is really drunk lmao.,17
"What the fuck was that, sunny G?",4
"Isn't this the second time Padikkal has got out like this? Stepping back and getting middle stump uprooted with a yorker? It looks like a tailender dismissal, maybe he should work on how he plays that ball.",5
Vk stare finally gets the wide call.,9
Koach in sharjah bois,3
Batting with Viral Kohli is a lot like the eating of an Orange,4
How did he predict that?,10
"Lol, Kohli almost dared the square umpire to NOT give it wide",10
Banton looks like a default game character you start with,8
Even Swanny talking about MSD and Kohli being in every ad lmao.,14
lol wtf Sunny,5
"Russell: Fine, I will do it myself",9
Hahaha Sunil G getting the prediction bang on,6
"Oh wow, a wide. The umpires' arms **can** move horizontally.",8
How cool is that Indian skipper & Australian skipper batting/running together.,14
Ha ha haaaaaaa -SunnyG,0
Vc gets koach caught n bowled,-3
Sunny G squealing like a happy little girl for guessing the bouncer right.,3
Koach calmly sneaked into the top 10 for orange cap scoring 223 at 55 avg,5
kohli dot ball count: 1,7
Collapse^Tm plss,5
That Sunny G laugh tho,6
Lmao Swann is shit posting the entire time,6
Running started,1
almost perfectly balanced... https://imgur.com/gallery/jRIeYqo,0
"We need 2 more wickets ,and we'll able to put the breaks on",2
Nice,1
Gill is so good looking...,7
Swanny is just a redditor with a commentary mic.,10
Swann really emphasised on the '69',4
Finch will become fit after this match,6
Koach won’t be able to run doubles like that day as long as Finchy is here.,3
Who's our fielding coach?,3
Sunny G sounding like he got bit by a rabid raccoon,10
Sunny smoked a thick one before this,5
SunnyG's lost his marbles.,2
Who tf is Swann?,0
What was that sunny,2
"Finchy, gotta be readier than that to run with this guy as your batting partner.",0
VK gonna make finch lose kgs,3
"When everything seems nice for RCB, rcb does an RCB..",6
"12 overs left

Nagarkoti has 4

Gonna be crucial",2
"Fuck drunk, i want some of whatever crack sunnyG is on",5
There is no way way we should be losing to Eclairs wrappers. We are the mighty and superior Royal Challenge whisky,4
rcb dugout can steal baz's book now,5
**Virat Kohli** scored 184 runs v KKR in the IPL 2019  (84 & 100) & it was the most any batsman recorded against a single opponent last season.,7
Finch is actually a decent runner. Almost every top tier international batsmen from the big 3 teams is a decent runner.,2
It’s funny how finch prefers helmet against spinners,0
Inb4 Finch just throws his wicket away because it's simply not worth the effort running with Koach.,8
KKR is ahead at this point,4
Going down leg it seems,4
McCullum is ex RCB right?  Aight what's he gonna do,1
MC finch defend mat kar! At least single le le!,2
Ooh looked out,1
Finch has no clue lmao,9
"Oh Finchy will be 5 pounds less after this innings, thanks to Kohlis running.",9
Finch looks like a fish out of water there,1
Lol DK,4
Finch is still looking lmao,9
DK with the dancing shoes on lmao,9
Finchy is rusty after that six.... Shit,6
Everyone was searching for that ball lmao,5
Bamboozled,2
"Every time people troll Gill with Sara, I cringe. It’s not middle school where this was funny.",10
[deleted],0
Finch is done,5
"Kohli said at toss that this wicket is not that high scoring as we saw in last game. 

But to be honest, it looks good for batting and RCB start seems slow. Finch looks completely out of touch.",9
Another Koach century against KKR pls,4
Fince is NOT reading Varun!,4
Finch is concussed i think after getting hit by Russell,5
Finch back to his odi knock ways.,4
Lmao ball kaha gayaa,4
Finch in Thala mode?,16
WTF finch????,3
Wtf is this tuk tuk finchy?,6
Finch rotate the strike,4
we're fucked,0
Missing Parthiv Patel,-1
It’s painful to watch Finch at this point.,3
What is the Narine situation?,0
Finch kinda sus ngl,3
Finch hits 1 six and shuts down for 10 balls,7
Finch making kkr don't miss narine,2
Finch has adopted the Inshallah and Swing protocol,8
So we aren't getting a 220 here.... I had high fucking hopes man,5
This is the same man that has scored 150+ twice in T20Is.,7
Finch had absolutely no idea where that went lmao,8
Finch wasn't reading Varun's deliveries at all.,3
Finch clearly struggling against spin,4
How fucking fast is koach ?,2
Finch and kartik bamboozled lmao,5
Sarjah + Kohli/ABD just doesn't feel nice as a KKR fan.,0
"DK: waking up after a long sleep, in a dark room full of spider webs. Where am I? Where am I? omg Where am I???",5
Klassic Kohli Kover Drive,0
Does Varun identify as a legspinner? Because I haven't seen him turning one ball this ipl.,0
So it's Morgan who was the captain afterall. Just kidding,0
Ah should have catch that.,-1
"Gee baz is talking  to commentators, how he's gonna catch up with his homework",1
Finch taking over the role of tuk tuk thala for haaRCB,3
Varun’s facial expression looks like a man who has seen everything in life and has lost them all,14
"CHAD-kravarthy second best spinner this IPL after Rashid IMO. Been so consistent and has bowled in powerplay, middle and death. DK seems to trust him so much and it's wonderful to see.",6
was that a drop?,1
Baz by doing this interview has missed out on the golden opportunity of writing 10 more pages /s,5
Somebody hit finch on his dick,8
Finch strike rate dropped :(,0
RCB should have sent someone as a Finch hitter. Since finch is not hitting much.,4
"Big 3s captains in field out there, cool sight.",3
[deleted],4
When did finch meet thala,5
i dont get all the hype about finch prior to this tournament. he's always been shit in the ipl and there's no reason that this year would've been any different.,-1
Koach is cringe in flipkart ad.,2
So whens rana coming on to bowl and get kohli caught at deep mid wicket just before saying BC at his face,0
Still 4 overs of Narine left. I think we're heading for 180-185 only.,2
Can we finally remove finch please? Get Parthiv in for him and Moeen in the middle order? Pleaaaassee?,6
Alright .. time to collapse red bitches,1
Is the game still happening at Sharjah? I expected RCB to go much faster,3
How do Finch and Maxwell play so well in internationals but look clueless in IPL,3
Chakravarthy always looks like he's had one too many drinks,4
Finch is the Thala of RCB,3
Finch playing a match winning innings for KKR,1
If Finch is struggling against spin it means he really is out of form. The normal finch would put that 15 rows back over long on,3
Can Finch do a Tewatia in 5 overs or so? Because he has completely stopped whatever momentum RCB had with that batting.,1
Finch has to go now.,2
MG Gloster ads are so bad,3
Finch making Chakaravarthy look like Prime Muralitharan.,6
Nagarkoti action is similar to Brett Lee.,-1
Big over alert this over,2
"Nice to see DK and morgs working together, might do wonders for KKR (already has with KXIP)",2
Hehehe..That throw after the great fielding though.,0
Is this Varun from Badlapur?,1
"Do or Die for Finch, I think he would've been dropped had RCB lost the previous game, strike rate is not good rn.",6
Nagarkotis gonna get bullied by RCB's daddies,2
RCB vs KKR at Sharjah is perhaps the opposite of tomorrow's match (CSK vs SRH at Dubai) in terms of the excitement,8
Finch needs to go big,0
Where do I find this press release DK and Baz keep talking about. Can't find anything on google,7
"*Kohli defends*

Commentators: Kohli is in excellent touch",10
Can we ask finch to blow bubble gums from the chewing gum he's eating instead of batting?,2
Finch needs to get out for everyone's sanity to prevail.,4
"Eoin ""I'm the captain now"" Morgan",15
The fielding has been so shit,5
"Straight to the fielder, nice finch.",1
What's up with youngsters at the deep nowadays?,3
Single and the commentaries saying nicely played. Kohli is in really good touch.,7
Finch and Dhawan- *Spidermen pointing at each other*,7
KKR is playing Rocket league at the boundary.,4
Tom Benton is in tonight ? 😮,1

Banton showing his keeping reflexes,4
Has the Sharjah pitch slowed down or are RCB being conservative?,5
"Finchy, you are one of my favourite ODI players and such a contrast dickhead warner, pls get out of RCB and find form thanks",1
Their fielding gave us two fours...  Still our start is average,3
Ipl considering the jerseys is actually just battle royale for telly tubbies,5
Kkr fielding is truly amazing,6
Need at least 200. Finch needs to get going,6
"If finch doesn't do a koach today, it is unacceptable",7
Virat is gonna Kill Finch ffs,3
Wait it's at Sharjah? 70/1 after almost 10 overs doesn't sound that good now,5
Nagarkoti getting smashed today,-3
"Any player hits a boundary: about time. can he do it again? Has not been in the best form.

Kohli take a single: EXCELLENT. HE'S IN GREAT FORM. THAT'S WHY HE'S THE BEST.",8
whats better 20 off 8 or 40 off 35 (when theres only 4 genuine batsman in the team)?,3
"Finch, what the fuck??",1
RCB only team with sub 7.0 runs per over in 6-14 overs this season. Even CSK scores faster.,5
"Kohli: *pushes the ball down to long on*

Commentators: Has there ever been a greater forward push in the history of mankind?",16
FFS finch!!,-2
Banton settling in to the KKR team perfectly with a bit of dodgy fielding. Although it was spinning a lot so maybe not so dodgy,-3
"10-12 years back, when MSD was our best finisher, no one would’ve predicted that he would be the head of Thala Academy today. Makes me sad to think what he did to his own reputation as being a hitter and not a tuktuk batsman",2
"What's up with the pitch today? Same as last match?

This seems like a 200-220 deck that we saw earlier. Finch n Paddikal both seemed slow",2
[deleted],-3
Need to go aerial at Sharjah. Ground shots will keep finding fielders,4
Bro this is proper canteen XI fielding,5
"Genuine question: do you think the commentators get told to gush over Kohli non-stop or do they do it off their own back??

It's genuinely incredible how they manage to spin every sentence and situation to be about him.",12
2009 KKR was wilding with the whole Multiple Captaincy BS and Fake IPL player stuff.,-2
No boundary since wicket. Finchy needs to redeem all the dots,0
"Koach refused single to keep strike, lol",-1
80 in first 10 at shrjah?,2
CSK & MI fans have ganged up with RCB against KKR. Yeh Khauf Achcha Laga xD,-1
"If Ab doesnt tee off

We can chase this down easily with proper batting till 7",5
is this odi?,5
I want Nagarkoti do well since we have similar long sounding surnames,-5
1.5 k comments on this thread already. usually whole match threads have 5k+ comments. i guess rcb fans/koach fans dominate this sub?,10
"Finch has taken his time now, has to go and score big.",6
Where's the INTENT™???,12
Have the tattoos on Kohli's biceps started fading or am I imagining things?,5
Banton hockey reflexes,0
"Finch is doing opposite of what RCB bought him for!!

Anchoring isn't his job.",4
I'll be really disappointed if RCB doesn't make 210 here.,6
Missed me guys? I'm back,-10
Why doesn't Finch just smash out of the park? Seems obvious to me,2
I understand that finch is playing slowly because we only have 4.5 batsmen but then again why do we have only 4.5 batsmen,2
" A Marathon innings has totally different meaning when it comes to Kohli, he kind of runs a marathon while batting.",0
Man Finch just sucks in ipl,-3
Shit batting from Finch! Needs to hit out now!,2
"Hate to see this brand of cricket!

This is not what RCB represents.",-4
I'm so pissed at Finch he need to do a Tewatia now to redeem himself.,1
Thala Finch,1
"If we score less than 180, finch should be sacked",0
Is DDP something Paddikal goes by or is it something the comms came up with? KP and Nicolas saying it repeatedly is quite annoying,-1
RCB are losing the game here man. Need to attack more.,-3
Pitch is already getting slow,-2
Woah just saw the team sheet. That's quite a long tail RCB have got,-1
Can't escape BTS even in ads ffs,1
60 balls and just 78 runs while batting first at Sharjah.,-1
"It's not that bad guys, we are prolly just 10 runs behind.",-1
"This must be a calculated move from Kohli and Finch. Wicket seems like it's getting slower and the target total RCB were aiming for needs recalibration.

If these two are around till the 15th over then they could explode though.",-1
Is this the lowest 10 overs score at Sharjah? in IPL 2020?,0
Kohli running hard trying to convert every single into double.. even though its a small ground.. now compare this to Rayudu doing his morning jog yesterday in a much bigger ground.. and then he wonders why the selectors didn't pick him last year lmao,4

Hard to understand the plan here. 78/1 on this ground aint a great score after 10 overs. DC defended 180 odd cos the bowlers were all in form. RCB doesn't have the same luxury and KKR bats deep. Someone needs to start hitting sixes...,2
"Superb over for RCB, no dots. Run off every ball :'(",-1
My name is Abhinav and every time Swann calls Mukhund I get startled.,1
Finch gonna get out in this over,-1
Looks  like too many people haven't watch last two matches in this pitch,2

"Anyone else think this tactic of planning out your score have a huge downside? Like, what are they planning today? 170 at sharjah?",3

Finch probably never run as hard as he is going to with Kohli right now,7
"All you guys defending finch, I don't understand. You think Parthiv can't play a 37(31) innings? Finch is an international player and more is expected from him on a belter of a pitch.",10
Virat pissed that the missed.,4
i feel like ABD is gonna come in and suddenly make this pitch look a lot better than Finch is doing,7
Are all wicketkeepers annoying with that chanter?,0
DK might miss Narine today. He was essentially their death bowler with DK using up Cummins' overs upfront. Interesting to see who he turns to today,5

Even in Sharjah, he will play at most 10-15 balls today, while RCB is struggling to maintain RR of 8.",4

Imagine the next time Kohli and Rohit plays together,6
"The pitch is different today, even Lara said so. Not the Sharjah we’ve seen previously.",3
[deleted],4
"Switched to dugout. 

Let's hope RCB is aggressive now",6
The way KKR has been fielding. I'll be surprised if we don't see another dropped catch in this innings. They've been all over the place.,1
RCB playing like the match is in Chepauk,2
My my how the turntables. India begging UAE to host their games. Fuck India. Fuck the Dubai Premier League 😂😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥,-16
When was the last boundary scored?,3
"at this rate, finch is gonna drop a few lbs by the end of his innings here.",2
Bro just get AB here,3
"I think Finch is gonna jump on the bandwagon, and come out in support of KL Rahul and Shikhar Dhawan.",4
Watching Finch is just funny now!,0
Nagarkoti in that hairstyle = Japanese Anime Character,2
When the fuck was the last boundary hit? We're gonna make 201 and lose with 2 overs to spare,2
"Sachin won't be Happy.
70% of people prefer padikkal over gill",-3
Finch noding his head be like... Fuck I can't do this anymore,2
">strike rate is just a number for some, and for others a reason to be dropped


-Unknown, prolly a prophet",3
Anything below 215 and kkr has the batting to do it with ease,1
Maybe this isn't a 220 pitch. Maybe it's a 180 pitch,5
RCB batting is deep wow. Hitters like Udana and Morris haven't got a look in yet. Why were they playing Gurkeerat all these games.,0
"Ball hits the bat. 
Kohli: Runnnnnnnnn",2
[removed],-7
Finchy will need an intravenous meat pie drip after this innings if Kohli keeps this running up.,3
Poor quality game so far,-1
"RCB fans if you want a highlight of Dhawan's innings yesterday, Finch is playing it out for you Live",6
"Whys everyone so negative, last match in sharjah 180 was defended",7
Finch’s incentive to hit 6s is to not run now.,2
"I don't even care of ab gets out, we need him to try to get set. Otherwise we are fucked with a bolstered kkr batting line-up.",3
"Well, I don't think 2s gonna work here guys.",2
This is so frustrating because I've seen both these batsmen literally chip sixes at small grounds. They seem to be playing like they don't have a middle order they can trust... Enjoy your fucking 8 RPO at sharjah...,6
Last boundary was scored by Paddikal,2
Pack up 😿😿,5
"Gonna be difficult to score 2s here lol

Koach: Hold my karele ka juice!",10
Nagarkoti has been good this over!,1
Pitch is dog shit.,4
Damn the pitch is slow af,2
"The ball is apparently stopping a little bit, might not be a 220 ground, just like the last game.",2
"When they switch to the overhead camera, it looks like someone snuck in last night and rubbed Vaseline on the pitch.",1
This pitch actually looks difficult to bat. 180+ can be defendable.,10
"They won't even get 160 at this rate, so much for 200+",2
Great changes in pace by Nagarkoti.,4
"Slower balls, not enough pace in this pitch. Not my Sharjah.",3
Epic battle Sunny G vs VIRAT,3
Bring me AB pls,2
"Best batsman in best form in smallest ground

Running doubles every now n then

Still 10 of 13 lol",7
Kohli's going to exhaust the fuck out of Finch with all that running between the wickets.,3
"Folks, u/KedaarJaadhav is the downvoter

Check his comments",8
loool this pitch is actually really slow might not be *such* a bad score. not great though,6
what is happening? nagarkoti outfoxing 2 national captains rn.,10
I am hoping kohli doesn't throw his wicket in pressure of hitting a big shot,5
The pitch playing tricks now. Even Finch who's been here for 12 overs is struggling to time it,6
"Kohli 11(14)

This thread: why is Finch so shit",26
All bowers seem to be trained by Bravo bowling academy,2
This pitch is really slowing down. RCB might not need to score 200+ to win,3
Finch better try for a boundary now. 1 down ffs.,6
Finch needs to move on here or he might end up costing RCB 20-25 runs,8
This is no sharjah I knew of,2
RCB will win if they get ~175,4
No boundaries in 28 balls . We're in sarjah madharchodo,6
"RCB playing too slow in Sharjah, Finch don't do a Dhawan like yesterday.",7
Our middle order is still unstable. Washington sundar and dube are good strikers but they're no pollard/Russell. We should invest in some good batsmen next year.,2
Finch is the dhawan of RCB,6
why does the broadcast angle looks like the match is in eden gardens?,3
Lol,1
Is finch genuinely retarded?,2
Sharjah has transformed into Slowjah. 160 should be enough.,0
Bc Abd deserves a much better team!,-1
"*Batsmen kinda struggling hard to hit the slower balls*

Siraj’s over: 143 146 144 139 144 143",12
Lmao we're fucked.,5
Dr Strange stuff from Nagarkoti with that Finch drop overs earlier.,4
KKR not bowling anything full. Clear tactics to make the pitch do the talking.,1
No Narine today?,1
"Who’d be in the Foodie XI in IPL ? 

Finch 
Rohit 
To open

Edit : May be S Tiwari, Pant , Hetmyer, Pollard, Mishra next",4
"This doesn't seems like a usual Sharjah pitch, 170-180 should be a par score.",0
"No boundaries last 29 balls

Is it really Sharjah?",3
The pitch is slowing and KKR are bowling well. Can people stop criticising Kohli’s strike rate FFS. Especially after what he showed last game and y’all creamed your pants.,2
What was umpire saying to Koti? Koti responded like a good boi,2
That was superb by Nagarkoti.,4
Fascist demonetisation supporting nationalist Viral Kuli oppressing white immigrant by forcing him to run and punishing him. I am emigrating. Bye bye,17
What is this tuktuk,3
"29 balls since last boundary , this is considered dry even by ODI standards nowadays",5
"KKR have bowled well tbf to them

Used the pitch well, everyone's struggling to time it",5
Is this being played at MCG?,-1
Ironic that the downvoters I'd is kedar jadhav,0
Why is he not ready for a slower one when the guy has bowled 5 in the over.,2
"Ok, next other will either have a wicket or a six",2
I was promised a run rate of 12. What is going on?,8
these ads on hotstar live are soooo awful and regressive.,0
"Kohli needs to open, he's totally useless playing like this",-3
Boundary finally,2
Finally,2
4444444444444,3
Fucking finally. Please continue.,2
Finally!,2
Finch might end up winning the match so i’m not gonna hop on the bandwagon like some fucktards,0
I don't think pitch is behaving like earlier matches. You all need to slow down.,2
"Finch shifting gears, here we go!

Edit: oh nooooo",9
Lmao,3
Lesgooo,3
Thank U Krishna!!!,1
Why did KLPD say “strike rate is overrated”. You can make such statements if you’re NOT the lowest ranked team in the IPL,1
"Pitches are starting to slow down a lot, teams with good spinners may start dominating. CSK still has a good chance to make the playoffs.",2
That was a great Yorker!,0
Lara the prophet,5
Nvm :/,1
Fuck you you useless pos. Eating so many balls. Get fucked.,-2
Damn same as Padikkal. Lara predicted it well.,2
Drop this motherfucker selfish finch,0
Finch fucked it up big time.... We're fucked,3
Finally,1
brian lara please tell me the lottery numbers,7
Ab cmon,6
Good riddance. Need ABd to get in.,-1
Oh damn,1
Solid yorker,2
Lara calls wicket alert and the wicket falls,2
Fuck this shit need Parthiv back,-2
Desperation from Finch.,1
"No Narine today at death, I feel they'll score at least 70-80 in last 5.",2
PK making Nehra eat his words even before they came out of his mouth,2
Lara wrote the script,2
"If it was anyone but Kohli at the other end, it'd be their fault Finch got out bc of pressure from the non-striker according to everyone",12
"I m actually ok with 100 of last 8


We can chase 190 here",3
Why the fuck did you take that wicket?,2
"**12.2** Prasidh Krishna to Finch, OUT,  **94-2**

AJ Finch  b Prasidh Krishna 46 (37b 4x4 1x6) SR: 124.32",0
This is a 180 pitch,1
These guys need to respect pitch or we don't even reach 170,3
We cannot afford to lose anymore wickets,6
Uprooted middle stump #2,5
That was a good yorker but such a tired shot from Finch.,2
Everyone dying to see AB even though he’ll just bat like these two cause that’s how the pitch+bowling is today.,6
Lara the Prince,2
Prasidh YESSSSSSSSSS!,3
"Finch was flinching in the crease so much, it's a miracle he didn't get out way earlier..",1
I knew he was out even before the ball reached the batsman. Smh.,1
"On the bright side, Kohli and AB running?",2
"Rahul, Pandey, Dhawan, Finch all seem to have caught the tuk tuk bug.",2
ha these two wickets have really triggered my test match sensitivities,2
That's on me. Every time I hype a batsman they lose their wicket.,1
Fuck this team... Rubbish to the core...,-1
He was my no.1 target for mid season transfer but Mavi got injured,2
"127 strike rate in sharjah after 37 balls, nice.",2
"Ah, the shot you play when you don't want to bat no more. Genius",3
[deleted],2
"Finch has secured his place for the next game.

Statpadder",-1
Finch ko nikalna chaiye. Moeen Ali better hai. Virat should open.,2
perfect yorker!,-1
Drop Kohli for Parthiv. This is the only way,3
People criticizing the batters ignoring how well KKR has bowled,9
A big relief for RCB!,2
I hope Kohli and De Villiers go berserk and get rcb over 200,2
"So bowled will the way to go, because fielders are screwing this up xD",1
47(37) in sharjah is not a good look,5
*F*ucking *F*inally *F*inch,2
Backing away and getting bowled is a really bland plot point,4
What is the meaning of KLPD?,2
Kohli praising Prasidh way back in 2019 and telling we can use him as an X Factor. Man is the real Jof,1
I think Finch was looking for a free chair there in the dugout lol,1
Did that guy remove his mask when the camera focused on him so his full face can be seen lmao,1
What is with Batsman leaving their stumps open again a yorker,2
"How is that a good innings, Sanjay bangar",1
What is that boat ad music?,2
Hopefully ABD fires today,0
Can RCB get one nice hard surface to bat on FFS,0
I thought 2020 was supposed to be special and different. Why are openers batting like it's 2010?,5
Rahul shown more aggression in the BOAT advertisement than with the bat this season,6
"DC have broken my spirits of watching the IPL. They are no longer the invincible team I thought they were and now even if we win the tournament, it’s no more impressive than others who have won it.",-6
Feels like every shot of finch is delayed by a half second,2
The pitch is becoming slower. Chasing won’t be easy unless there is plenty of dew,1
"""We will have a bat, thanks. """,5
Guys is dugout better than the actual commentary?,4
Beauty!,1
Man we need team players Finch and Padikkal both play for there spots and 50's,6
47(37) is a bit crap,-1
Abd with real intent. Hope he doesn't get out early,5
Finch looked dead from all the running Kohli made him do,5
Start your prayers now if you got any,-1
Ok now we'll know if it's the pitch or not,3
Turns out dropping Finch's catch was best outcome!!,-1
Are they playing like this because they are a batsman short?,-2
"Who looks more tired?

The Sharjah pitch or Varun Chakravarthy?",3
Ab Save us.,9
What the hell happened to this pitch,2
"We get 1 more wicket before death

We win easy",2
Definitely a sticky wicket,1
Such shite batting,1
Man really went ahead and said “batting couple”. I know Kohli and ABD love their bromance but common Karthik. Calm your tits.,5
"Rookie move by prasidh here.

Mumbai did not dismiss dhawan the whole 20 overs thats what won them the match.",10
"ABD going hard from ball one. 

Get yourself in first, Sir. Go bang bang later.",1
"Meanwhile dumb cunt nehra "" Koi nahi naye batsman ho time lo""",3
The battle of the telly tubbies,1
"Finch in T20I: avg-38.44 at 154.65 SR

Finch in IPL: avg-25.97 at 128.89 SR

How can there be such a huge difference especially when the quality of bowling in the IPL is definitely lower that what he must be used to in internationals",10
in before finch makes a strikerates are overrated comment,9
Is there a way to watch dugout on TV or I must have Hotstar?,1
"Prashisd is a really tall boy.
Never realized that.",1
Finally ab is in.,5
What a fucking shot,6
My man PP would have scored a glorious 30(18) and gotten out just after PP so that Kohli/AB gets more time to bat,8
Bam!!!,6
Lol 🤣 ... How tf that went for four.,5
There u go boys,3
Damn power in abd's shot,5
Just Sharjah Things...,3
Lol. AB bamboozled KKR,5
Lmao wtf was that,6
What a shot.,4
"Waah ,......ABD",3
Finch looks like a toddler in comparison.,1
"Batsmen after not being able to hit in Sharjah:

What is this place?",2
"Hit the stumps and still went for 4 lmao

Smashed that",7
Mr. 360 degree works in mysterious ways. Talk about placement.,11
That was amazing lmao,3
Well placed AB,6
Stump scoring more boundaries than Kohli,19
The best duo in IPL over the years on the crease❤️😍,5
ABD always inventing new shots like it's nobody's business,9
Tf just happened,2
Bowl in the slot bois,2
Hit the wicket and still went to a boundary WTF,10
NGL I lowkey thought that it went through umpires shoes.,3
KP needs to have a pre-game wank to ground himself before an AB/Kohli partnership,5
Is nehra commentating on the hindi team or dugout?,4
Karthik saying Intent twice. *Hmmmm I wonder*,3
KKR have bowled superbly,6
"That’s some genius level placement by AB, can’t set a field for that shot",3
ABD now also making the ball go 360°,5
Can’t even remember the last time when AB and Virat scored 100+ partnership. 2016?,2
How hard did he hit that wtf,3
This is equal to jofra six off the stumps,5
Fucking Aussie Chris Pratt can't bat,8
I N T E N T,11
"Despite getting wickets last match and now, I think Prasidh Krishna needs to work harder on variations plus intent. For some reason I can't get any vibes of intent from this lad. Does anyone else feel the same?",2
Get these 2 wicket and the tail begins...,1
I guess That's one way to find the gap,4
Good to see a bit of reverse swing. I think T20 is a much better game when theres reverse swing to work with.,4
Madlad is playing fucking snooker out here,3
100 in 7 overs isn't impossible with Kohli already set,3
Lol boundary through midoff after hitting the non striker end stumps.LMAO,4
"No one: 
Commentators: whEres tHe iNteNt???!!!",10
RunningBetweenTheWicketsPorn.mp4 is loading...,1
Imagine your nuts in front of those wickets when AB hit that ball,5
So now ABD can hit 360° from non striker end as well. True 720° player.,11
"Need atleast 84 runs in the last 7 overs (12 RR) 

Possible with these two. 

Even 100 possible with wickets in hand",5
INTENT,2
RCB can still get 200 from here,2
"The mental gymnastics some of you go through to defend Kohli lmao

He's a brilliant batsman and comes off more often than not but it's okay to admit he hasn't started this innings well",11
"Paine said Finch has been in every IPL team, was he ever in CSK?",8
Kohli has so far sucked the momentum in this innings.He can and prolly will make up for it but still...,6
Is Moen Ali not considered a proper batsman?,2
would love to see another Samson/Pooran like knock today,3
"“tighter & tighter”  
“harder & harder”  

Murali watching too much porn",36
"Finally, some good fucking batsmen.",6
"What is the par score on this pitch & surface? 
(Not sure whether this is the typical Sharjah surface/pitch or not)",2
Guess Kohli has forgotten they are playing in Sharjah..,13
12 off 2.2 overs of Nagarkoti really shows RCB hasn't batted well,6
Someone needs to go berserk here,3
"Mumbai bros, power restored?",2
Shubman is sleeping,3
Anyone else thinks if RCB scores below 170 it's KKR game,6
ABD had to shout twice to Koach,3
KKR's fielding is worse than RCB's and that is saying something.,8
Nagarkoti has used the two paced nature of the pitch to his advantage. Hope he holds his nerves throughout,3
What would be a good target today? I am thinking 185 minimum.,3
Crowd noise level already on 100. DJ waiting to go on overdrive anytime now.,3
Slowhli,8
"Whenever Kohli runs I get Forrest Gump vibes. 

Run Forrest, run.",43
Lol Kohli just looks to score 2,9
I know KKR is bowling good but is this still a 200+ pitch?,8
"KP, Murali and Anjum.... *shudders*",6
bro what is Kohli's 40m time,5
WTF they ran 2,6
"Lads, how long has it been since a Kohli century? Feels like it's been a while and I miss it :'(",2
Everybody hypes Mavi and Nagarkoti but Prasiddh is better than both of em,4
do you guys think labushagne will play in ipl next season?,6
"The commentators are still praising Kohli, despite him being 14(15) lmao",0
Koach going for the 2s even in sharjah,4
Gill busy daydreaming about Sara Tendulkar,5
Kohli should be 'run' machine not run machine,6
Kohli’s making these ODI starts but I think you shouldn’t need 15 balls to get in and then expect others to score fast with 2 overs left,3
Show em Russ,2
First remarkable fielding by KKR. Noice Russel,3
Kohli is obviously an incredible runner but the comms splooge even when they’re easy 2s. Pathetic,3
Finch clapping like.. it's so nice to see them running from pavilion.,3
Wait how’d they get a 2 from that lmao,5
Why do these commentators get more excited for a 2 than for a 6?,4
Fours are overrated,2
why tf is kohli doing this running bs in sharjah? start smoking 6s already!,10
"Kohli saying ""Chai Kuli ki mai kuli"" before playing every ball.",9
"Seriously, Fuck Russel and Pollard. They're basically two players in one",14
Burning a lot of rubber ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°),1
Dugout is overrated. No emotions it's almost as if a teacher is reading out ppts for you.,4
This ain’t Dubai to run for 2s. I WANT SIXES!!,3
Wow. How does one field like that with an injury?,7
Guys do you think Nagarkoti will ever be good enough for the Indian International Team??,5
Pitch is not great for batting and koach knows it. Calm down guys.,11
Russell generally is a beast but against RCB he turns into a monster.,8
He called for 2 as soon as he touched it what a madlad,4
"The openers also did a jackshit job. 

Finch scored at 7.62 runs per over

Padikkal was slightly better at 8.34

Wasted the Powerplay.",2
Tewatia should get man of the match today,1
Was KP even a good runner?,4
Nagarkoti is bowling brilliantly,2
Kohli farming the strike from ab :(,2
"I thought our bench was great, KKR's is fucking bonkers",8
That was a great ball from nagarkoti,5
Excellent spell from Nagarkoti,3
Would be treat if Nagarkoti clean bolws kohli,7
"Damn, Nagarkoti turning on the burners!",3
That was a great delivery,2
"Woahhhhh, that delivery by Nagarkoti. Mindblowing.",7
That was great from Nagarkoti !,1
"Commentators describing Russell fielding as brilliant, but if he spilled that they would call it a mistake",-4
Nagarkoti has been so impressive..,5
"Kohli puts his right glove on first, interesting. Always went left first so I had my thumb available to pull the right one on.",5
Is Gill dating Sara Tendehar,9
youngin Nagarkoti looks impressive against this legendary partnership,5
So are we gonna discuss Kohlis tuk-tuk today?? RCB lagging behinf right now,3
"For a change, RCB’s gonna score a mere 150 this match and defend it successfully",5
Nagarkoti has bowled seriously well to Kohli,7
CMV: 10 rupees for a single cookie is massively overrated,3
Good bowling by KKR to Kohli till now. Will they be able to keep him in check for longer though?,3
"Nagarkoti was not that good in the last game. Got smashed in his last over vs CSK.

The good thing is he seems to be learning every day.",4
100 runs in 15 overs in sharjah......another glorious loss on the way,7
"That should be an iconic delivery. A young, fast bowler like Nagarkoti yorking the fuck out of the best Indian batsman with a 145 kmph ball.",17
"Ye mai karleta hoon, aap jake dream 11 pe team banaiye",5
"Dunno man, not sure if flexing your running in Sharjah is too useful for the side. 

Would rather just hit boundaries. Only 4 boundaries since powerplay, one of which was a misfield by Gill.",12
The fact that Kkr have an extra batsman makes it more important for rcb to score 190+ here,11
Koach is getting frustrated,5
"Kohli knows after this pair there's no recognized batsman, hence he wants to stay till the end to make it count",4
Kohli will pull a tewatia now,3
Ab has to get through this over.,4
RCB doing tuk tuk at a 200+ ground. It's like they want to get fucked in the ass by the big man ;),4
Getting vibes that Koach is gonna do a Hyderabad here,4
It feels like Kohli is on the pitch since forever,5
Ball seems to be staying low,3
Who else apart from Kartik and Chakravarty are Tamil in KKR?,5
Really impressed w Nagarkoti,5
Russell muscle,3
So impressed with Nagarkoti today. Was waiting to see him for last couple of years and was a bit underwhelmed with his performances till now. Today hes been real good.,14
Even Finch was faster at 20 balls wtf. Pitch really slowed down that means.,10
Only a miracle can save rcb from losing this one lol,7
Moeen Ali in. Finch out. Parthiv Patel opens. Moeen Ali a good middle order batsman and can finish.,5
"great., by the time other teams plat at sharjah it has become slow af.",8
Kohli zero 4's and only two in shj,4
What are they even doing? Start smaking already. Come on AB and Virat.,8
Why couldn't Kohli bat like this last match BC,9
Is it too slow or they're batting terribly,3
"It would be meme if RCB scores <170 here, especially how much shit DC got yesterday",5
KKR are bowling really well. They have a plan for each batsman and are executing it very well.,8
If deVilliers and Kohli are finding it hard... I'm sympathising with Finchy more,13
If we don't get 100 in the last 5 we fucked,6
Ab just get off strike please.,-2
Hey Koach! It's possible to show your respect towards MS without batting like him,11
It's a flat deck ffs,5
In Canada which channel is dugout commentary on?,4
180 is the best case scenario now,4
What is a boundary?,6
DK please stfu,-2
How on earth has Kohli not hit a single boundary so far,6
Only reason Openers had a SR of more than 100 was because of Powerplay,7
Is DK talking in Tamil ?,6
AB Dot Villiers and Virat Slowli,7
That is some terrific display of spin bowling!!,2
Wtf batting is this,1
areee bhai maro bhenchod..,1
"I promise RCB will win it one sided.

You all are idiots.",6
If these two have not been able to time it then this pitch is definitely slowing down and KKR will have a tough time chasing.,1
Who gives a fuck who Gill is dating jfc,7
Why isn’t Narine playing?,3
Maybe we shouldn’t have been shitting on Finch. This is slow,8
No Narine? I know there were action questions but I thought he could still play. Did they just want an extra batsman as its Sharjah?,3
We're going to lose this game in 12 overs. 10 if we let Siraj bowl.,5
Tewatia for post match awards as lord is omnipresent,5
"""Boowl raa""",2
"This pitch is fucked!!

I thought we will see 200!! 160 will be excellent here.",6
If they're still 2 down at the end of this over they need to go *hard* in the last five,3
"Need to get Kohli in the next two overs, you don’t want him batting in overs 17-20.",7
Varun's contribution is underrated in this IPL,10
I miss the old Sharjah,6
"Varun looks like an old school, melancholy Bengali poet.",14
"Koach isn't getting a boundary today, is he",6
This a tale as old as time when playing on small grounds. Kohli runs like the wind and makes a hard working score setting up a decent target. Russel and Morgan etc just come out hit two boundaries every over without bothering with running and chase down the target in a hurry.,7
"Maybe they're just bowling well, guys?",11
what the fuck is going on? is it kohli? its it ab? is it the pitch?!?!?!,5
Again two by kohli,2
Are the fielders of this generation really that much better than those of the past? Seems like no body can find gaps anymore,9
Great bowling from Chakravarthy,9
Excellent fielding at the boundary from last 7-8 overs.,9
lmao if chahal bowls the 15th he'll go for 25,7
200 is out of card today. Damn it. We are already 20 runs short. Lol.,8
"Alright Varun is done now, these two better start going ape shit else we'll be out of this before the 2nd innings even begins",4
Isn't Varun takung lot of timr before delivery?,1
Had Kohli not played that blinder a few days ago. This thread  would've been all over him for being on 20 off 21 balls.,12
Is the pitch slow today?,5
Felt KKR were a bowler short at the start of the match but they bowled really well till now,4
Pitch was pretty slow for that DC vs RR game here too,2
"Is this the ""we were 15-20 runs short"" game",5
Does that ad have Darth Vader breathing? lol,2
"Didn't realise Banton was playing, hope he has a good knock",2
This wicket went from the most entertaining to the most boring,6
"How good are KKR bowlers, projected score is 148 on Sharjah pitch against explosive RCB batting line up",1
Ae Kohli chauka mar na,2
The leggie's done. Time for ABD to shine now!,2
BCs can’t you see the ball is not coming on to the bat?,-2
Chakravarthy has been so consistent so far,3
Pretty sure the ability to take instructions in Tamil from DK so that other batsmen don’t understand where Varun will bowl is part of the reason KKR went for him.,7
"Kkr have bowled really well thus far. If we can restrict them to 160, it would be great.",1
in b4 kohli makes his 'we were 15-20 short' speech later,8
KKR have completely tied them up.,1
Literally everything is finding the fielders,4
A bit too conservative from RCB I feel.,2
Kuldeep is watching this desperately trying not to well up,3
Either they pitch has slowed down or they are taking the batting order of KKR very lightly,4
We easily defended 180 odd here which RCB can get with some lower order hitting.,5
The ball is just isn't coming on. 170 could well be on par here.,6
"People this ain't a 200 pitch 

More like 175-180

That being said RCB should accelerate",8
It's Sharjah right ? Looks like pitches really are getting better for bowlers,4
Now Sharjah is fair game. Bowling friendly pitch with batsmen friendly boundries.,11
It’s not a 200 pitch y’all. Stop saying tuk tuk etc. Strike rates are overrated. On slow pitches. That’s what Rahul meant.,7
Could still get 190 here easy,0
"Can anyone tell what is the meaning of ""Koach""",1
Seeing KKR batting line-up feels like we have already lost the game,2
"2 minutes of silence for KXIP, they got Chakravarthy at 8.5 Cr last year and didn't get the best out of him. Look at him now. 25 from 4 overs at Sharjah",9
Nagarkoti playing a blinder today,6
"Pitches showing their true colors.

Half the matches done and guess the pitches are now dead. 


Might change the complection of the tournament. Don't worry, CSK still won't make it xD. No INTENT.",2
Now r/cricket so called experts will call Abd slow.,6
Nagarkoti deserves a wicket. He has been bowling very very well today.,3
some of you guys seem to think batsmen are deciding not to hit boundaries on purpose . t20 does really bring out a lot of uninformed people.,6
is this a record for most 2s run in sharjah?,1
"Kohli post innings interview:
'yeah we were 15-20 runs short'",6
Why do batsman don't understand you can use your feet against spinners not just to hit boundaries but also singles/doubles,1
Something happened to the pitch. That's not normal shitting the bed.,7
2 in Sharjah is like 1 in Dubai,3
Credit to the bowling from KKR,4
Just 35 runs in the last 5 overs,6
KKR has bowled smartly and wicket is slow,2
Guess Finch wasn't an imposter after all,2
Morgan wearing two caps to subtly hint he's the real captain.,11
So it begins,5
IDC if the pitch is slow. HIT OR GET OUT !! You guys have 8 wickets,2
Fucking finally,2
Come on AB! Let's get going,3
Fucking finally,3
Lessssss go. ABd just sent it.,3
We need more please,1
200's BACK ON THE MENU,2
It's not exactly coming into the bat guys. Pace variations are really hard to read on this sort.,5
Any pitch is a 220+ pitch if your bowlers are RCB enough,8
"By the time final comes, even 100 will a competitive score",8
Goddamn no fielder there,1
That was such a fuck this six,3
Here we go. Let's keep it going guys.,2
This Sharjah reminds me of LB stadium in Hyderabad.,4
"85m shouldn't be out of the ground lmao

Tiny stadium",4
Ni maar sutya...,1
I thought they're playing at Sharjah???!!,2
That was coming from ABD,5
Chakravarthy to Chakraborty. Great transformation,6
Is there any site that lets you search specific stats like average of a player in a particular country?,5
"Bowling's been excellent today, very impressive",3
"Rcb: ""Strike rate is overrated till the 16th over""",6
Traffic beware!,2
KKR bowling this year has been something for other teams to envy,3
Why are they batting like they’re 6 wickets down,3
Oh noo,1
One full ball and this happens. Rcb bowlers need to see this.,3
"This part of the match is dangerous for KKR. Will have to dismiss Kohli & ABD, otherwise they will undo all the great work till now.",4
Anjum tries too hard to be witty and its cringey,3
No Narine and RCB are struggling to score 170 at Sharjah of all places. RCB are in a lot of trouble today.,3
Who is the Indian guy in the dugout?,3
AB is on fireeeee,6
That Six almost went out,2
Back 2 back baby,4
I am not liking this,5
RIP KKR,5
"Kamlesh had 20 good balls

Ruining it now",7
Let's gooo!!!,2
Abd is on guysss! Expect a storm,3
"Oh boy, here we go",5
Pretty sure that's an Unacademy Cracking Six.,11
200 incoming,3
Yass,2
HOT DAMN,1
ABD GOD,3
AbD is a God,4
AB!!!!,4
The difference between Kohli and abd right here,10
"Haha, if this were gully cricket people would stop playing with ABd for losing the balls.",38
4th six in 16th over at sharjah. Sanju Samson would laugh his ass off,9
Did that hit a car?,23
AB you absolute god.,7
AB might just set himself up for a bouncer now.,3
thanx lara,1
Pitch looks flat af,2
Feelsbad for Nagarkoti,5
Surprised a ball hasn't smashed someone's windscreen yet,5
"Lol if RCB get 70-80 off the last 4, it meant that they fucked it up in the middle overs.",7
55-60 needed here,2
The ball hit a car 🤣🤣,5
"Haar roz Diwali nahi hoti, Nagarkoti xD",2
Ball hit that moving car lmao,5
Narine not playing today cause of the warning?,4
Watch kohli take a single,3
Too predictable from Nagarkoti,4
"I get so pissed off looking at those fucking Bangalore tech nerds for some reason

edit: lol i wonder who's downvoting this. complete mystery",-14
Cars outside stadium are in serious danger. Does insurance cover AbD onslaught?,14
That road should be closed to traffic during play.,6
RIP KKR lol,1
Damn nagarkoti's figures got ruined.,9
Wide outside off  coming up,1
Can car owners actually sue the stadium???,76
The cars in danger,3
Expecting this pair to cross 3000 runs today in overall partnership,6
"Hitting the ball out of Sharjah multiple times

Ab De Villiers 🤝 Saurav Ganguly",6
Hahaha ball hit the car. Maybe they can give away the Altroz or whatever,7
KKR vs. RCB is a great matchup to have at Sharjah.,2
Imagine having to put in an insurance claim for AB hitting your car with a cricket ball,30
Lol person driving that car must be confused,3
This is so dangerous for the cars,11
fucker finch,-8
lmao swann,0
Imagine you're driving and a ball just hits your car,12
Lol the ball hit the moving car,2
If the pitches slow down spinners are going to be important in the back half. Hope Zampa/Ali come to party.,4
"Finch sitting at dug out watching ABD: Oh fck mate, good he retired!!!",8
If the ball hit a car and it causes a fatal accident... What kind of legal shit IPL would be in?,21
Completely ruined his figures there lol,11
"Yeah RCB have kinda fucked this with slow batting. Even on a worn Sharjah pitch 180 is the minimum. Taking nothing away from KKR, this bowling display has been nothing short of spectacular.

Now watch them chase the total in 15 overs.",11
This is why we needed finch tf out of the ground earlier.,4
 A B D,3
"Umpires: How many  balls should we bring  
Batsmen in Sharjah: yes",6
What was the architect of this stadium smoking seriously,12
The balls literally hit the cars outside the stadium.,10
ABD is just muscling everything. Do you see that bat swing?,3
Nagarkotis figures went from sweet 16 to Karen,9
Lmao how’d that reach the boundary,2
In before Kohli says strike rate is overrated.,5
Will Abd pay for damage for the car ?,8
"Sorry to be boring, but the regularity of balls ending up on the road must surely be a safety issue for cars.",65
"To be serious, there could have been an accident",28
"Question: if the ball breaks a car window, can they get compensation?",16
Still believe another 60 runs are possible here with 4 overs left.,6
“Oh boy I can’t wait to get home and meet my family. Hey is that a cricket ball? AHHH”,20
Lol. Who is at fault if that ball cracks a windshield? What will insurance say? Perfect ad for Farmers (we've seen a thing or two),4
Would love to see Kohli belt Cummins.,6
"**Least runs conceded after bowling all 4 Overs in Sharjah in IPL2020**

I am very excited to see Tom Banton play,8

Swanny😂😂😂,8
An accident waiting to happen in Sharjah,9
Brian Lara is on fire 🔥🔥 in the Dugout,8
Swann is on some good shit tonight.,2
Lol swann,3
Udana can be unplayable today if his cutters are accurate.,4

The dugout is so fun XD,8

"How to fuck ""change of pace"".

Masterclass by AbD.",4
Nice to see Lara. Haven't really seen him since retirement,3
Commentators when ball hits the Altroz: *how can she slap?*,8
Imagine what Dre Rus can do in this ground.,6
Is Mavi playing today?,1
"ABD when in plays a different game to everybody else doesnt he?

What a joy to watch him, just makes anybody batting with him look dull",6
What the fuck is going on in the dugout rn?,4
"4 overs 60 runs isn't that hard, cmon RCB!!",3
200 still on,1
We need AB to bat atleast 18 balls here,8
"
3 overs 18 runs..
last 1 over 18 runs...
nagarkoti",2
The dugout is bloody brilliant. Brian Lara and Graeme Swann absolutely killing it.,6
Good call bringing back Siraj today,8
Kohli deserves the same hate Dhawan got for his last innings.,10
That driver probably freaking out about a puncture if he doesn't know cricket,9
"ABD to Kohli trying to hit six:

Ye me kar leta hu aap Dream XI pe team banalo

T: Let me do it you can go make a team on Dream XI",8

"Guys neutral fan here. Whose victory gives CSK a greater chance of qualifying? Like even 1-2%?

"If you know there's a game going on, just avoid those roads. No one's gonna pay for your windows lol",7
These erectile dysfunction ads on Sky UK are a personal attack I feel...,16
Russell is going to cause multiple car accidents today,10
It should be capitalised ABd not AbD. Thank you,7
"Whatever you think a par score is, add about 15 runs each for Dre Russell and Siraj.",4
How does the pitch get magically easier to bat at the death???,5
Can't they tie a net by standing up 2 poles to prevent damage to cars?,2
"**Kamlesh Nagarkoti**

First 3 overs: 18 runs 

Final over: 18 runs (2 0 6 6 0 4) vs AB de Villiers",8
How about Kohli coming in at 4 and AB at 3?,2
Kohli just 1 ok.,2
Lol Swann asking if the ball that went out on the road hit an Altroz,4
got greedy trying to bowl him four on the bounce,3
Master Blaster Jay Shah in the house boisss,2
Swann really wants it to hit the car,4
Jay Shah = MTV Roadies S6 Devarshi.,3
250dollars a ball. Dafuq?,2
That looks like a fairly busy road,2
Am I reading this correctly? We're two down? In sharjah? In the 16th? And we only have 130?,7
Kudos to the cameraman!,5
Perfect results.,1
Oh fuck it's Cummins,3
"If anyone is wondering, gurkeerat is standing outside the stadium throwing those balls back",14
Think Parthiv should replace Finch. Or Philippe.,2
"Why do commentators suck off RCB so much. I mean God, they are treated like the Golden State Warriors, but at least GSW have chips to show for it.",3
"Utter shit fielding tonight , must have leaked 15 runs",4
Nepo kid Jay Shah w/o a mask. Absolute chud,6
ABd should smack Jay Shah's face.,7

"**Kab khaulega re tera khoon, ~~Faizal~~ Kohli?**",10
"Gonna give up on this season if we(SRH) can’t win against CSK tomorrow. Too many crucial injuries. Not to mention the lack of flexibility in the overseas combination won’t allow us to tinker around. 

Only hope left is for guys like Shankar and our
Indian talent to have a good season. Let them rise to the occasion so we can count on them for the next season.

This season let us sort out the middle order. Next year let us comeback as a solid title contender.",5
Kohli has not hit a single boundary??!,3
You bowl three great overs and then you come face-to-face with a certain Mr. de Villiers. Life lesson for young Nagarkoti from KKR.,8
Ab fucking smoked it. Fetch it cumdog.,7
Will they deduct ball expenses from taxes. Will Sharjah levy a fan for every ball on road ? So many Q,3
The way Dugout does Altroz sponsoring reminds me of Internet Historian’s Nord vpn ads.,5
Elegant,5
[deleted],6
"6 6's

Edit: nvm",4
They should just make Pawan Negi stand outside on the road & catch the ball,6
Chin masks continue to bother me,2
"This is why Cummins bowls 3 overs in the powerplay, dickhead commentators",3
It's just not possible to hate ABD,6
need 90 off these 4,9
I'm scared 😰😥,2
Cummins might go for 3+ sixes this over...,2
AB really wants to break some windshield today,2
AB has to purchase liability insurance before he's allowed to play in T20 tournaments.,3
Dayum ABD hits so so well.,4
Can we trade Cummins in the transfer window somehow?,1
"So, does this mean what the pitch is actually nor that bad to bat on?",2
Cummo is not in form 😓😓,2
It's just incredible how good he is,3
"Oh, stop I can't get any harder.",4
Ahhhh.. Cummins & Sharjah.,3
Kohli this is not a ground to show your superior running skills.. start clearing the boundaries,3
"Fucking hell, can we clone Varun for another over",2
The dugout is on fire rn,2
Leave cumdog alone ADB,3
You think the ball landing on top of your car is bad? Imagine it hitting the road and bouncing up into your car window. That's real health hazard than just car hazard,2
What an absolute god.,4
De Villiers is going to murder some poor Arab pedestrian by the end of this innings.,2
I am happy to be here watching ABD in full flow,1
Beautiful striking!,1
Has the pitch transformed?,2
"Finally Abd saving the day, it was pretty much shambolic before that.",1
Do they get the ball back from the highway?,2
AbD on song is THE most destructive player on planet.,6

What lengths are those balls? Poor bowling,3
Cummins is goinz,4
Cummins proving his worth to KKR.,6
Bat speed. 😱,3
how tf that wasnt a wide,0
Cummins will cum this over,2
Gonna get to 200 with ab,3
"Cummins: mein chutiya jo isko ball karne aaya

T: Oh Shit",4
Kohli still anchoring the inning while AbD goes beast mode.,5
So guys is the pitch not slow anymore now ? Stupid logic,5
Pitch is now faster I think,3
De Villiers is the most talented batsman since Lara/Sachin,9
Can AbD please skip this one?? I swear I will continue loving him if he just decides to spare us this one time🙏,5
I would hate to be driving near the stadiums now,4
I was fearing we will only reach 150,5
Bouncers are bailing out Cummins,5
"Slow Kohli has two forms:

Slow Kohli because he has no support from other batsmen

Slow Kohli because he knows ABD will make up for it",18
AB our lord and savior has arrived,4
"Please Mr Cummins, no more today.",5
ABD going crazy. Jeez.,5
AB went from 80 odd strike rate to 200 in 8 deliveries,8
KKR pulls of his mask. It was Gujarat Lions all along.,7
"I have a feeling if the bowlers let RCB down this time, ABD personally this time will give them a spanking individually",11
This is what I want to see when I watch a RCB match,3

Jay Shah with a quintessential Gujju shirt lol,6
So many mediocre batsmen trying to imitate lord Sarfraz,13
WTF CUMMINS,5
ABD in beast mode,10
Cummins so dreamy that even ABD gets on his knees,10
ABD missing his pre medidated 360 shot against any bowler other than Bumrah makes me sad,7
Abd making sure r/cricket criticize Finch and Kohli.,18
"AB stop fucking about and un retire, who are you kidding playing like this",5
Bowls 2 good dots then gives AB a full toss in his arc lmao,5
Kohli following the footsteps of Thala,1
When will kkr learn Cummins is not a death bowler?!,6
200 ez now,1
ABD is in some mood today. I wonder how many times Kohli will exclaim BC :),1
"Kohli plays the sweep to perfection and AbD misses it, what is this?",1

Finally a Sharjah game that feels like Sharjah,6
What’s not a big match jeez,1
"Cummins has been a waste of money, wish we kept Nortje",2
37 of last two,1
How is csk vs srh a monster of a game lol.,5
Don’t we all wish AB had continued playing internationally...,6
I dont think cummos IPL payout is enough to afford the therapy he's going to need after that over,5
Man AB is just different..,1
"Sunny G: the punch line will come to me, i'll just start speaking.",3
AB you magnificent beast🤩,1
"Last time Cummins bowled bad was his first match against MI in which he compensated by scoring 33 off 11. Be afraid RCB, be very afraid.",6
Ab retaining strike let's GOOOO,3
Rcb are 105 off 14.3 without ab,3
KKR just try out Ferguson or Ali Khan (if he is fit). Cummins hasn't been worth the money.,1
Kohli hasn't face  a real ball for last two and half overs.,11
Man I wanna see Udana whack a few,4
Devilliers is that gully cricketer who retains strike at the end of the over because his partner is shit,14
"Srh vs CSK tomorrow. Oddly I'll be backing CSK, the underdogs, tomorrow 👍",7
"Lockie is fit, right? We really need to bring him in the next match in place of Cummins.",2
That awkward moment when you wish Kohli’s on strike.,5
I think 180+ will be very difficult to chase here,1
175-185 score today.,2
Can we get to 200. Pretty please.,4
AYAYAYAYYYY,3
"19 runs in the over with two dot balls, that’s the “ABDV effect”",5
How is CSK vs SRH a bigger game than this? What's Brett on about... probably going to be another snoozefest,7

Wish they continued playing like this since the middle overs,5
ABD should come back for the 2021 World Cup.,2

AB farming the strike from tailender Kohli I see,5
[removed],3
I've seen so many comments both against and for dugout. What's the verdict finally? Can't stand SG anymore.,2
Koach choked the momentum,0
ABD to deny Kohli a single and send Indian Twitter into meltdown.,4
i think we can get 200,2
Cummins is a very bad T20 bowler. Can't hit Yorkers and has no change of pace when required.,3
ABD total mental today,2
"ABd is no 360. He could barely cover 160° this match 

/s",2
"AbD is like, Kohli, enjoy my batting from non strikers end for these overs. Thank you.",3
AB makes everyone look like shit doesn't he,7
Playing with and not against ABD is the key to a peaceful life.,9
Just pray Tripathi/Russel/Banton are in a similar touch tonight while batting,2
"Here's an idea lads

Don't bowl full tosses in AB's arc",2
"Well that was some shit bowling 

Cumins is not in form",2
Kohli vs AB for greatest odi bat?,2
Good guys KKR have got both Finch and ABD back into form,1
Smack that Altroz ABD..!,3
Imagine you are a young bowler trying to make a name for yourself and then the captain throws you the ball and you have to bowl to this raging mad south African. You would be better off trying to fake an injury to get off the ground.,6
I will conceive abd's baby,5
this game depends on russell batting performance,3
ADB smashing it so well ಠ︵ಠ,3
KKRs fielding has been garbage today,3
Locker Ferguson would be a much better pick then Cummins at this stage.,2
"They are getting 200, aren't they?",2
Altroz fucked,5
This is why ABD spends his free time playing golf,5
ABD playing at God level. What a treat!!,3
"The shittiness of this pitch is being very overstated. Dhawan did the same thing yesterday. At the halfway point, everyone was saying that the pitch was so difficult, dhawan couldn't hit because the ball wasn't coming on, blah blah. Sky walked out and fucked them, then the whole discussion changed.",5
ABSOLUTELY MET!!,2
"
Keep bowling full tosses, pls and thank you",2
ABD loves Kohli so much that he is just giving him a show on the front lines.,6
"why you guys memeing siraj, he has a good record",3
Wtf is going on here?,1
I'm disappointed he missed the car,2
What the fuck is wrong with this guy,1
Slow pitch yeah?,3
Oh fuck! This is slaughter.,2
I have just 10 more mins of break left and I don't to miss AbD being a beast,3
They should just rename it the Tata Swann Altroz,6
I love ABD so much❤️😍😍,4
ABD is god,4
Just unreal,7
"Pitch is not slow. The ball was stopping in the first two games as well, yet both sides scored 200+. Even the MI SRH game the ball did something, MI got to 200 plus with ease. DC batted garbage last match and got to 180 odd. 

RCB just lacked intent from overs 5-15 and AB is exposing it.",4
ABD is a god,7
Stop the game now,7
Wtf ABD,7
ABD looking for that unacademy let’s crack it sixes cheque of 1 lakh,5
Damn how do you hit like that?!,3
AB hogging all the strike. Not a good sign for KKR. Also.. Since Dre Russ bowls so much hit the deck stuff. This one might get real ugly.,5
God I love swann,2
You love to see it,5
"De villiers be like "" fuck that altroz in particular """,11
ABD's an different animal,5
Classic de Villiers,8
Holy shit that’s high,10
The only reason ABDV took a single instead of going for a boundary previous over is to take strike this over lmao,11
My man. 50..LOVE,5
"Bowling a full toss to ABD, what could possibly go wrong?",4
"This is amazing batting, it's almost like watching Mark Wood bat.",3
De Villiers legit looking to score fastest century now I guess,4
Gotta love watching AB do his thing,4
I don't think Kohli will be half the batsmen AbD is once he retires from international cricket.,6
Abd is god 🙌🙌🙌,4
Fuck I made ABD VC instead of captain.,5
What's the average first score innings here?,2
holy molly,2
Russell ka ras nikaal diya.,3
"Really shit bowling by KKR in the last 3 overs ,  bring in Rana ffs",2
why? why today? why? why?,3
This is how one should retire. Where people feel bad they retired. Unlike many others...,4
Russell has too much of a bodybuilder physique to be a fast bowler. Fast bowlers should be mean and lean.,2
KKR is fucked today... Go home,1
"Gaand maardi ABD ne bhenchod damn

T: Well played",3
"""Doesn't matter if the pitch is slow or the ball is slow if you yourself is seeing it in slow-motion""

"ABD = Aaj Bhi Dominate

Done with Hindi commentary",9

BEASTTTT!!!,3
AB batting on a different pitch,5
"Problem: AB is too tired to keep right after batting in the UAE heat

Solution: don't bother running just swing every ball lmao",8
"I really wish this season hadn’t been such a flop for Cummins, the most expensive buy and he’s only taken two
wickets and is probably averaging 100+ with the ball, and his economy is poor too. His IPL career has taken a massive hit. Hopefully it doesn’t impact his international form.",4
"AB show is onnnn... When he is on song, he will make any best bowler look like a gully cricketer.. still remember what he did to Dale Steyn. He is playing on easy mode..",9
King ABD,6
ABD is in full one man army mode wtf,12
So the pitch is not being difficult to play,2

Should have played the wc,2

Kohli is the biggest cheer leader rn loool,5
Be honest we're all a little gay for ab De villiers,14
Made ABD captain...mixed feelings rn,2
Last few overs feel like I've been watching the highlights reel.,2
ABD explaining power hitting to his student Russell,8
"Heck, they almost got the Altroz!!",2
I can't believe people think Vk is the best batsman in this team.,2
Can only sing his praises so much. He's so fucking good.,2
AB on Compound V tonight,4
Abd and Kanos belong to the same school of non chalantly hitting bowlers,4
"KKR had us in the first half, not gonna lie",3
Kohli stay off strike.,3
If AB can keep Koach off strike 200 might well be possible,3
Just noticed that AB has his own customised MRF signature like Sachin had “Genius” and Lara had “Wizard”,5
Imagine how many cricket loving children living in extreme poverty we could have funded with Cummins 15.5 crores,6
"He runs, he bowls, he gets hit for a six.


*Still in 'Haunting of Bly Manor' hangover.*",5
Now there you dont want to rile up RUssell that much also.,2
Jeez.. This is turning into a bloodbath.,4

"Best bromance in cricket history.

Koach and 360😍",12
"Someone: ..............Altroz..........

Swann: BEST IN ITS CLASS SAFETY",4
Poor keeping,3
Someone report ABD to the police. This is manslaughter.,3
Kohli has scored only 9 runs since ABD has arrived.,7
DK has fumbled quite a few today,2
"AB and Koach at the crease..

MRF: Stonks 💹⏫",2
"Well I don't care if rcb does not win, this is marvelous!",1
Kohli is more affectionate with AB than he is with Anushka🤣,4
KKR should have been worried looking at ABD's last innings duck. They know law of averages is going to catch up and fuck them,5
Village fielding so far,2
Tactical bye to get VK on strike,12
Intentional misfield from DK /s,5
"AB always seems to care quite a lot about how RCB do.


The poor bastard",5
Chad ABD hogging the strike,3
Good keeping DK,2
Koach on strike,2
He should have come in at 3,3
Big brain fumble by DK to get AB off strike,10
"200, any takers?",1
Cheeky DK... Misfielded that on purpose,7
DK gave a strategic single to get ABD off strike,10
"Krishna yorking Finch turns out to be the game changing moment of the game so far.

For the other team.",9
Kohli finally getting strike,5
DK there trying to give and a single to get him off strike,6
[deleted],1
Kohli in his safe space watching AB bat at the nonstrikers end.,3
LolDk,1
Dube and AB could do some damage together here,3
18 balls since kohli got the strike lmao nice,8
"AB needs to play the next world cup. Given the pitiful state of SA against their T20I series against Australia, they desperately need him",3
Kohli is just watching the show from best seat in house.,2
"Can't believe how I want Kohli to keep strike.
Abd just a superstar.",3
RCB about 40 runs short at this stage,1
Kohli can't get it up 😔,6
"AB: Fine, I'll do it myself.",3
Damn Kohli is under 100 right now.,3
Russell's gonna bowl the last over,3
KL to Kohli probably- That's my boi /s,7
They are still sucking Kohli's dick lmao,6
I thought I was a little gae for Kohli. I'm definitely gae for AB.,3
Tactical misfield from dk,3
[deleted],8
Who is this new player Kohli cant even have SR of 100. 😂😂,4
"BC let some one else keep today, don't want to make ABD work more.",8
ABD is making kohli look like a taileneder.. imagine that..,28
Unpopular but AB should look to keep strike and not take singles unless it's the last ball of the over,5
"Dafuq is Koach doing, either hit out or get out",2
What the fuck is swanny smoking. Two 50 scores at almost 200 strike rate is a person that owes a contribution? (Excluding this ofc),6
Drop finch and open with kohli.,6
Lol who was that unit,3
"RCB shouldn't even bother getting the openers out...

Russ can anal the fuck out of this chase and bowling",12
200 still possible?,2
I'm real disappointed at my dad for not being Amit Shah. I too want to watch the IPL in the stadium like I own the place.,11
KKR desperately needs a good fielding coach. These fumbles aren't helping them.,5
This is shaping up like exactly last year's game where ab scored an absurd amount in the last few overs but then russell smacked the shit out of us in the death and we lost,26
Kohli: I’m gonna take a single and watch the big show from non-striker’s end,27
Lmao koach stuck at 100 sr,8
"I really don’t like this timeline thing on the score bug, or at least how long they seem to keep it on the screen for. Really annoying when you want to check the batsman’s score or the bowler’s figures but they insist on showing you that there was a dot ball three overs ago",12
Kohli taking Dhoni's words seriously.,11
"**Before today, AB de Villiers has the second best scoring rate in the last four overs in IPL since 2018**

Faf du Plessis - 16.04 rpo

AB De Villiers -  15.20 rpo

A Russell - 14.70 rpo

Pant - 14.12 rpo

V Kohli - 14.10 rpo",6
35 runs pls.,6
"Ab De to coach KL Rahul on his statement ""Strike rate is overrated"".",11
AB man you are evergreen,7
Another 35 in 2 overs will be fantastic.,3
Phillippe should replace Finch.,2
Don't think rcb stand a chance even if they score 200 with dew setting in,2
Whoever hits the Golden Altroz will instantly score 150 runs.,2
Lol 200 with out of form Russell is gonna win RCB the game,1
"Yeah, RCB is losing this. Lots of KKR batsmen are capable of this",3
"Bring the field up for Koach, as long as ABD stays off strike",3
"Abd to Kohli : Ye main kar leta hun, tab tak aap dream 11 main team bana lo.",6
"It's insane how well KKR were bowling to Virat and Finchy, but all of sudden they have forgotten how to bowl to ABD.",3
"Nephews in here are so stupid. The best thing Kohli can do is give strike back to de Villiers. 

I swear some of these folks never played cricket",6
Wish Ab came in earlier...,8
Maybe the only guy who can make Kohli look unproductive is AB,9
"3000+ partnership runs between Kohli & ABDV, most successful in IPL I bet, respect!",3
Kind of recovery of sort from Russel in this over after those first 2 balls,2
I live Kohli's face every time AB hits a 4 or 6.,4
Bruh there's gonna be one match where both Virat and ABD will shit the bed,3
Rana for last over ?,1
54 runs in the last 3 overs,1
Has Kohli struggled today? 21 off 22 doesn't look great in Sharjah. Genuine question,4
Big over alert,1
"16,17 and 18 runs of the 16th, 17th and 18th overs respectively",2
I too would happily be satisfied with singles and give the strike to AB if he’s in such hitting form,3
Kohli still no boundary?,3
"In any celebrity relationship, one person is always more famous and carries the relationship. In the much vaunted Ab/Kohli partnership it is AB that makes it famous.",3
"Kohlis cursed, no boundaries today",2
Haha Kohli still can't hit a boundary,2
It just isn't Kohli's day,2
Give ab the strike! We don't need fucking twos .,3
Will Kohli hit any boundary today...,2
Kohli still no boundary,3
"IMO, whoever wins today will move onto the playoffs along with MI and DC.",3
Kohli tryna join the party,1
Kohli following KL's footsteps,3

ABD - 29 balls vs SRH",9
VK still not getting boundary,3
Kohli still running the twos...,3
Koach finally gets that 100 sr,2
the stark contrast between this thread and the last time kohli played lol,4
Lmao Kohli's cursed today,3
Still 2s...,1
Kohli is improving his test average,3
"2 again, fuck off.",3
Kohli score a fuckin boundary,2
DK missing all throws lmao,2
Koach give the strike to ABD pls,2
Why run a 2,1
He uppercut it there??? Wow,5
Koach trying his level best,5
Fuck. Kohli should give strike to ABD. 2s are not enough,3
"I admire Koach a lot but he's gotta stop running AB into the ground here. Either settle for a single and let AB do his thing, or swing for the fences. Poor guy still has to keep",5
Virat Kohli to change his name to Virat Twoli.,8
"Let ADB bat, ffs",2
The one time Kohli's twos aren't helpful,8
Kohli ffs,3
Not a brilliant idea that from kohli,2
Is this a new look for DK?  No longer the hirsute beard?,2
Finally Koach.,3
KKR won't mind twos if it means keeping ABD off strike,2
Why doesn't Kohli take a single and let AbD do the hitting?,5
His first boundary and that too by an edge lmao,8
"Give AB strike, wtf...",3
Finally...😂,3
Koach pumped up for an edge that goes for 4,8
Who wants some edged fours. I want abd sixes please.,3
I wish there were more than 2 overs to watch of this batting,8
And he got a lucky one ffs,2
"Kohli's first boundary , commentators are excited",6
Wow you ungrateful bastards. Never celebrate another Kohli innings again,11
First boundary are you fucking kidding me,3
Give AB the strike ffs.,5
Finally koach,4
Kohli taking run machine to a different level!,3
Lol,2
"Poetic justice. Kohli's only boundary through an edge.

6 Times - AB de Villiers

5 Times - Others",11
"Brett: ""prashid going for it with no protection"" ಠ_ʖಠ",9
Kohli gonna tire out ABD instead of keeping him on strike.,7
Kohli needs to give the strike to AB. These 2's are just peanuts on this ground,7
Those two are adorable together,9
"Kohli with lot of hard work in a over: 2,2,2,2,2,2

ABD: 6,6,6,0,0,0",10
Please be a single,3
Koach acting as Riyan Parag,11
"Man, say what you will, but this was a shitty innings from Kohli.",2
Lmao fist pumping after edging it towards the boundary,10
[deleted],4
KKR are really fielding like they have oil on their hands,4
Get a single and give strike to AB. We know you are fit.,6
Did he celebrate that 4 like krunal pandya ?,10
[deleted],3
[deleted],3
"Just for today, let tripathi and banton open, let them go berserk and utilise the powerplay",6
Kohli fist pumping for a knick lmao,37
Kohli celebrating an edge like he won a final. 😂😂,104
Don’t fist pump that you flog,6
Kohli celebrating pulling off a  Denly cut.,9
Koach is v happy with a 4,5
Poor Krishna. Bowls quite well and still ends up with shit figures.,8
RCB vs KKR matches are action packed for sure.,5
ABD it's time to go Atmanirbhar,7
"Quite Poetic. In an innings where Kohli has struggled, his first boundary comes through an edge :)",9
Rcb have an extra bowler and Kkr an extra batter. The chase will be exciting,5
AB almost always de Livers,9
"Smart batting by kohli 9 runs of the first 4 balls, let ABD finish it off.


EDIT: he also takes single lmfao ... i got nothing now",8
"Binga: oh no he's missed his length its a full toss

Swann: Did someone say Altroz",75
"Kohli getting his first boundary of the innings on the 25th delivery.

Edit : With an edge.",5
Kohli hit a six cmon,7
Hilarious that Kohli was like “YES BC!” for that edged four and AB has been like “meh whatever” after hitting all those sixes.,14
"While Kohli single handedly won the last match ,his innings along with Finch's  will hurt them big time here .
Morris and Sundar can bat, so this sedate batting is unacceptable , especially at Sharjah",8
Surprised Prasidh has only gone for 39 so far.,1
Okay this is getting annoying by Kohli,3
Kohli please don't take a single,4
If Kohli takes a single I swear I'll quit supporting rcb,8
Kohli celebrating a nick like Bangladesh celebrating a test win.,29
ABD still in proper Nick even when he doesn't play as much cricket as the other Batsmen. Well South Africa's loss really.,13
Kohli is almost 32 and he he still behaves like a teenager. That’s cute.,18
Hit or get out. Don't take a single now koach!,4
[deleted],9
kohl should get himself out ^ducks,0
AB farm the strike now,8
Kohli is fist bumping because he's happy that team got those precious runs in the death overs. He was relieved that he could've finally hit a 4. He has always been a team man.,15
Kohli is a waste man,-3
[deleted],3
"30(26) - fistpumps a mishit.
58(27) - nonchalant sixes.",19
20+ over incoming,4
"Wtf, Koach is pumped for 2's now??",3
Is 200 still possible?,2
Why is VK not able to clear the ropes here,6
Kohli bro,2
Kohli robbed this over from ABD.,3
Who’s this uncapped Kohli Guy. Needs to give the strike to ABD. He’ll never make it,31
KKR is really missing Naraine in death overs.,2
Iyer's acting is insufferable almost as much as that Dhawan's innings,6
"Nobody





Star sports :- *hello hello check check hello hello*",9
"Well, at least AB gets the strike now. Don't take a single this over.",7
AB deLivers,0
Kohli bro just run 1,3
Kkr bowing everything in that one line for Kohli,1
Please AB don't give him strike this over.,2
"Wait for it , camera will pan to Kohlis wife, jumping for joy and blowing kisses like a World Cup win.",1
"Send 3rd man back, and bowl yorkers outside off?",2
ABD knock will make the difference in this game,6
[deleted],3
Had kholi just dropped a single on ball 1 that over would of went for 2x the amount,5
What's with Koach? Played too OP against CSK,6
6 66666,6
"Fuck it

Ab >> 2* kohli",8
"Kohli celebrating a nick going for a four vs Krunal celebrating a ball not given wide

Spiderman meme",14

36 run over incoming.,3
Just don't give kohli strike pleaseee.,4
RCB will reach 200 won't they?,3
"Come on bois, tear Dre Russ a new one",1
"For one of the biggest superstars, Kohli has no ego issues with either of his loves wearing the pants in the relationship.",7
"Top player failed in one match, and people here call him *a failure*. Lol wut?",11
KKR gonna chase anything under 200 with ease. This is not good :(,2
How is that speaking in the background?,2
Lol kohli celebrating an edge,3
What the fuck is this happening in the commentary box 😂,4
"Kohli fans won't be appreciating Kohli's running for one's and two's as much, after seeing ABD by his side smacking ball around",8
Oh boy we’re so lucky,6
Koach celebrated that edged four like Khaleel celebrates a caught behind off the glove down the leg side.,10
190-195 finish I reckon,3
I want ABD to refuse a single to Koach. :D,4
Fuck ABD should have come at 3.,6
Ab is the only guy who hits sixes effortlessly without being a power hitter like Gayle or Russell,5
Village captaincy from kohli,4
Pooran and AB have similar hitting styles,2
Sharjah still the 200 par score pitch?,1
Dropping Gurkeerat for an extra bowler turned out to be the right choice now that they've only lost 2 wickets.,4
Gavaskar jinxed Kohli into losing his form lmao,3
Russel is gonna give it back... Be careful RCB,4
"3 more sixes, mark my words.",3
Nothing less than 200 sr satisfies you guys anymore.,15
DreRuss better makes up by bat for all these pies,6
That dot ball is worth its weight in gold. Like hitting a 6 for a bowler.,1
Can we have kohli open and abd at 3 please?,3
What a shot from AB.,1
Surely this isn't the Intent™© Dhoni talks about,3
Get him off strike ffs,3
ABD 7 out of 7 balls *blinks* 68 out of 30. WTF,7
This is why I said ABD should come earlier. Score could have been 220+ if ABD had 10 more balls to play.,4
Kohli is amazed,5
What a fucking shot,6
Gawd,6
Unbelievable shot,7
WTF AB? How did you put it for a four?,10
Sunny describing Kohli like an anime girl lol,6
Im sorry but how the fuck did he hit that for a boundary,8
The absolute fucking shot,3
"Mark Nicholas chats pure shit

He's just got an ok voice",2
inb4 AB gives Koach the Tewatia treatment.,2
Massacre!,1
Wtf I am hearing hindi and english commentary both at the same time,3
Oh boy. A siren,2
Yay no ball,1
HAHAHAHA,2
FML,1
Good innings by night Watchman Koach there. Good thing he didn't throw away his wicket,5
Koach cheerleading Abd batting..,3
God mode,2
This guy isn't human.,3
Nuke alarm gone off as well KKR are done now.,2
Oh fuck me,2
Free HIT,2
Oh no Russel (ب_ب),1
"Yikes giving AB a free hit

Big oof",1
That’s just outstanding,2
"Fukk, Kohli actually cost them 20 runs.",0
200 please,1
Abd is on a different level.,3
NOOOOO,2
Free hit lol,3
Rip,1
Running loads of 2s is not an efficient T20 strategy,2
Imagine bowling a great wide yorker and seeing it placed for a boundary with ease.,5
Russell haah,1
Yas no ball!,1
why run 3 twos when 1 six do trick,2
"Ok that shot should've been illegal.  


 That's just unfair amounts of talent.",5
Cmon these no balls are scripted right? Fr,1
Thats criminal. No ball in last over to ABD,3
Yeaheheh BOI,1
"Kohli: BC kaise maara woh yorker ko, match ke baad sikhaana mujhe  
(How did you hit that yorker for a boundary, teach me after the match)",7
Only AB can make have other teams want Kohli on strike instead,18
Man I wish finch had fucked off. We could have seen an abd 100.,5
Still Ab is the most destructive batsman on the planet,8
ABD is a machine,6
ABD masterclasss,3
How did that 4 go over the advertisement board,3
ABD explaining how to bat to his student kohli,2
This guy has cheat codes on,7
Was that dude really standing right infront of umpire,5
Kohlis T20 style pays off once or twice a season. De Villiers style delivers almost every match,-2
Atleast the pitch ain't a slow one,1
"That can’t be a legit action by Dre, can it? Seems off",1
Man... Am I hearing things or is someone speaking in the background.,1
What this galichap background noise in hindi commentary😡,2
Just realized Siraj is playing today. Looks like we are 20 runs short.,2
"ABD played a dot ball in the final over, so Russell made up for it by bowling a no-ball💜",4
People hyping DreRuss again only to get edged by Dube,3
Why are people shitting on Kohli? Dude literally won RCB the last match and here he is trying to give AB the strike more. Smh,19
"This is what happens when the anime protagonist music is playing in the background.

Like wtf AB is just touching them and ball is just flying off the bat",4
"I'd say Kohli cost us about 15 here, but it's still an amazing total and should be defended",2
"Safe, as if you can get him run out",7
TIL that AB doesn’t need to dive to get in,4
Rayudu would be better off not watching today’s game. Could hurt his confidence.,3
"The angle is so predictable. Just got to swing one away.

Missed the trick not playing Lockie.",2
"200 is hard to chase wherever but in sharjah against this bowling attack with banton, Morgan and Russells 6 hitting ability the issue for KKR is gill might waste deliveries",7
Prasidh Krishna as leg umpire lol,3
Why are there so many no balls in the death overs this time? Did they used to get away with them earlier?,3
"Hell yes for increased stump cam vocal action! They're professionals, mostly mates... let's hear what they have to say. Total immunity for the odd ""swear"", ""blasphemy"", ""whatever.",2
That was surprisingly a quick verdict from the 3rd umpire.,7
Imagine making a batsmen like Kohli look like a club batsman. Only ABD can do that.,17
Kohli lost them the match.,-1
Oh boy we’re so lucky x2,2
Tf is wrong with commentary. I'm hearing both hindi and eng,5
fuck can ab keep after running so much?,7
"Everyone shitting on kohli,but look at the situation. He came in and asked finchy to go after it. Finch couldn't. When vk wantwd to accelerate abd came nd took it away. Vk didn't get the chance to be honest to accelerate. Apart from a few balls here and there",9
Its a very different workd that guy can't play golf,4
How are they running twos like this wtfff,14
Why there are two commentaries at same time on Hindi Star Sports?,5
Kohli wanted to be 1st on boost stamina meter today,3
No 200,1
"holy shit...i just logged on and we were 106 in around 15 overs, wtf happened? why do they always hit when i'm away? same thing last match",0
There are few things in life that i enjoy more than Russell getting cunted & getting a taste of his own medicine.,2
Bruh Banton to chase this,2
That is some running,3
Kohli OUT on last ball,1
ABD is always playing using a cheat code,5
"Everyone talks about the ""short"" Sharjah boundaries but something I noticed is how when batsmen hit it, it always is over 75-80 m except for the odd six or two which barely crosses the boundary line.

Does this prove that it's about the mindset? I mean if sixes were hit ""only"" because of Sharjah, surely every six should only be 60-65 meters but that's not the case.",13
i feel bad for the guy who has to chant ABD ABD,9
No century for ABD. Sad.,4
How can Kohli not hit sixes here?,2
"**5 or 5+ 6s in an IPL Innings**

Gayle - 26 times

**AB de Villiers- 17 times***

Pollard - 12 times

Watson - 11 times

Rohit - 10 times",13
Gave away too many in the last 5 but our batting is deep tonight. Confident that we'll chase this.,2
Look at that partnership..,1
"Come on kilo boi, cunt the last one for a six",1
No 200 lads,2
ABD 360 single handedly fucked KKR tonight!!,11
A six would do justice koach. Don't disappoint,3
Come on 6 end it on 199,1
199?,2
"Honestly RCB are one of the most entertaining teams to watch. When winning it's either due to contributions from Kohli or AB or both, which is blockbuster entertainment. And while losing(especially when defending a target) Kohli cam is hilarious.",11
Poor Dre. Bowled quite well and still ends up with a half century.,6
RCB 60 runs short,5
DC fielding was surely better than this,4
"wow, did not think they'll get to even 160.",5
This was a shit innings by Kohli today ngl,8
r/cricket experts have always been wrong. See us win one sided.,12
Lol Koach didn't run two for his average,10
Lol masterstroke from the master.,8
"Sanjay : ""ABD loves being on top"" ಠᴥಠ",33
"Let's not be too harsh on Kohli, every batsman struggles sometimes.. he did won RCB last match..
That said, without doubt, ABD is the best batsman in RCB.",19
Stat padding by kohli by denying 2 /s,5
So Virat did a KL this match. Thankfully his good mate ABD scored for both of 'em.,8
[deleted],11
Man AB has to keep today. Sucks,7
Great over from Russ,3
We're 20runs short,0
I think this will be a very difficult chase for KKR. AbD made it seem much easier to bat than it was,16
[deleted],-4
100 run partnership,3
VK why no six at Sharjah man. That was a poor innings,3
Is this par?,1
LMAO- Kohli refused the 2nd and you can see Morgan silently judging him in the background,18
Imagine the dick sucking from commentators if Kohli had done what AB did today,13
Rooting for Russell to explode today,1
"Lmao, what a shite innings Mr.Koach.",3
Dre will murder Siraj tonight.,3
There's no need to blame Koach or Finch. No one except AB could have played such an innings.,28
"**Most fifties in 23 ball or less in IPL**

6  Kieron Pollard

**6  AB de Villiers**

5  Virender Sehwag

4  Yusuf Pathan

4  David Warner",18
Andre Russell doesn't look too good. I would have let him rest today tbh,2
"Morgs is gonna smash it, no tuk tuk bullshit",3
restricting below 200 is a moral victory,5
"This score feels 10-20 runs short, now bowlers have to deliver for RCB",4
Hopefully Banton goes off on this ground. It's crazy how RCB have managed to score close 194 after KKR slowed the game down so much.,3
Fuck me 83 off last 4,3
83 of the last 5. damn,2
Did Kohli deny that cause he did not want to get run out?,2
ABD's back must be wrecked from carrying the team of tuk-tuks and keeping.,8
Lovely man Kohli protecting ABD's average by not running the 2nd,7
Bruh shikar was better in comparison.,-1
Yep rcb losing today no doubt,-2
Kohli denying double on the last ball. Looking suss playing for average,6
ABD just built different 💯,7
Imagine if AbD came in to bat before Kohli... RCB would have at least scored 220.,5
Only one boundary for Koach on this small of a ground. Unreal.,5
"Wait, what were Hindi comms talking about just now? What did they apologise for?",3
Ab singlehandedly making up for both finch and kohli,13
F I hope this was a ABD masterclass rather than the pitch.,7
"Russell 50, in bowling that is.",4
Did ABD forget he retired? He isn't supposed to play like this.,10
RCB managed to get it done with just 4 batsmen lol,6
"Man Kohli should literally worship Abd for that innings, if not for him going beserk RCB would've been nowhere.",12
[deleted],2
Don't think we can afford Kohli and Finch. Play Philippe as opener and give him license to attack. Reduce burden on AB and gain a gun fielder,8
RCB has a solid total. Siraj’s spell will be the deciding factor IMO. If he gives away 50 or something It could get close.,2
Kkr should open with banton,1
Russel hit his first half century of IPL 2020 by bowl.,5

"Not to ruin it for RCB, but both Morgan and Russell could potentially easily pull off an AB for KKR",6
I will never understand players who reject a extra albeit impossible run of the last ball.,4
"I hate it when people turn down the run on the last ball of an innings, suicide running is where it's at come on",9
That was actually an incredible over from Russell barring that no-ball. Might just make all the difference today..,4
De villiers and Kohli in the last 4 overs has more jump scares than “the haunting of the bly manor” i have been watching.,3
"Someone earlier wanted Ab n Vk 100 partnership 

There u go ma frn",0
"I don't get this fist bump thing. They're already in a bio bubble, don't wear masks, sweat profusely, touch the balls and are just short of kissing each other. How worse could a handshake be",14
"wow, I didn't think they would even get to 160 at one stage.",7
"For real, is 194 not enough on this pitch?",4
"Hope banton open excited to see him, KKR batting is dangerous",8
I think Kohli-ABD is the highest partnership in the IPL History now. Over 3000 runs.,5
Why does Kohli not run two there on the last ball? What had he to loose?,4
Just mere 83 of last 5 overs,7
Kohli should open on grounds which are more friendly for power hitting... Can score more in the powerplay with the gaps,8
Well above par. Y’all don’t know cricket. Pitch is slow and ABD made it look better than it is.,9
Kohli should have slogged mindlessly but who am I to teach him,11
Did rcb misread the pitch or was it just superb batting from abd?,10
"Damn, RCB scored 83/0 in last 5 overs.",10
Baz always struts around looking like he wants to fight.,2
"195 seams like a good score .But on a ground of this size,the match could go either ways",4
"Yea, KKR is easily chasing this",3
Morgan and Russel gonna shit on us,4
33 (28)  👀 73 (33),15
Genius propelled RCB to a respectable score,7
65 runs in last  4 overs,5
Morgan clearly undermining DKs authority,4
McCullum luvs chinggum,8
"Commentator : What Master stroke will we see from this master ?


Kohli : A Single !!!",25
How has AB not played more T20s for South Africa?,6
"[Once again, if you are around 100-120 for 2 around over 15 you can push towards 200. this is a clear strategy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/j8jetr/match_thread_25th_match_chennai_super_kings_v/g8c02ie/?context=3)",8
How long till KKR bat?,1
Morgan no doubt shaking his head at Kohli not running 2 that last ball,6
"Okay so KL Rahul has been the most influential batsman this season with influencing batsmen like Rayudu, Kohli, Dhawan etc. this season.",6
And now Dre Russ will be injured for the next game. Big brains by KKR management bowling him 4 overs smh.,8
"AB de Villiers was 10*(11) balls but ended on 73* from just 33 balls including 5 fours & 6 sixes. So, 63 runs of 22 balls",12
Congrats russel for that well deserved 50,3
My prediction will be KKR ain't chasing this with Russell getting out in single digit and gill playing a match losing innings,3
I love Kolkata vs Bangalore threads. Perfect mix of nerdy 19 year old Computer Science students and 35 year old African Studies students,25
"I swear, we have Gill, Banton, Rana, Morgan, Tripathi, Russell and DK. That's. 7 fuckin batsmen on this kids playground. We SHOULD chase this down but KKR can always pull off KKR things",7
Oh fuck off ya cunts with the Kohli bashing.,8
The only way kkr are winning this is if Russel finds form,3
So Finch played a better innings than Kohli I guess?,11
"Chakraborty, Krishna and Dre bowled quite well today. Cummins was poor.",2
"if anyone can meme russell into form, its us. kxip learnt it from us after all",3
"If one of morgan or dre russ comes good, kkr will chase it.
Pitch isn't bad as finch and kohli have portrayed",1
"For KKR - Russell, Banton, DK, Morgan can pull off an ABD. Don't write KKR off yet!",7
Boy Kohli just needed some strike at the end. People be shitting real hard when he played one of the best IPL innings a couple days ago.,5
"33 runs in 28 balls. 


If you don't have a problem with it, you are based. 


Def based",3
Pretty much zero misshits from ABD's innings. If finch had fucked off we could have seen a hundred.,6
Imagine the amount of shit that will be thrown if it was Dhoni instead of Kohli.,7
"Fuck

So called experts still justifying Kohli knock

Come on man he had a bad day everyone has one. 

Accept it",17
"We should not try to get wickets today. If Russell bats, then we dead for sure. Lol",5
200 was average in shj  rcb made 194,0
I think kkr should go with banton ans Tripathi at the top and shubhman should bat as the floater but I guess they will give that role to Tripathi.,2
Imagine what we could've seen if nagarkoti didn't drop Finch's wicket!,4
"Honestly just like the last game against CSK, not sure if ABD played a blinder on a difficult pitch like Kohli or if this is just about par.",6
"**AB de Villiers highest scores vs KKR**

"83 off the last 4, ab is insane",7
"Kohli has one semi-okay game, now he should open and not be there at the end... lmfao wtf",7
Will delete my account if KKR chases this. Pitch is not as good as shown by ABD,11
Not to fatshame finch but he seems like he's lost a lot of weight. Waiting for Rohit to follow his footsteps.,3
Kohli teaching Dhawan how its done. Love it when the captain leads from the front!,-3
weary money familiar coordinated ossified literate angle disgusting fragile roof ` this message was mass deleted/edited with redact.dev `,6
"Why so much hate for kohli? Yea he didnt play good today and that why there’s 11 players in the team. If one doesnt play good, others make sure they do. Abd played really good and RCB made a decent score and pretty sure its a slow wicket so 194 is not a bad score to defend",17
"Kohli was fine in the last 5 overs but very poor in the previous 5 overs. Not asking him to do what AB did, but a couple more 4s here and there could have made this a 210 score.",9
"Russel made 50 even when RCB was batting,This guy is a real legend and game changer of the match!!",10
r/Cricket please meme Russell back into form!,6
Varun CV was amazing today. 6 runs an over at Sharjah is as good as 2 wickets imo.,1
"All the people shitting on VK, his game is built on ones and twos and Sharjah being a small ground is not really conducive to those, also he didn't get a chance to accelerate, in the last 4 overs he only faced the 6 balls.",8
"**RCB While Defending 190+ Target**

Won : 13

Why isn't Narine playing? sorry I joined late,3
AB and Kohli batting a position too low imo. RCB need more middle order batsmen,2
"Two of the best limited overs batsmen in the world struggle throughout to time a ball.   


ABD scores 73 off 33, after having 10 off 11. Just ABD things.",17
Lmao Kohli purposely played singles to get ABD on strike and ppl here are acting like he was doing a Dom Sibley impersonation.,15
"I swear this sub has the most idiotic hivemind. If Kohli gets out there's literally no other batsmen to  A) Go bonkers or B) Support ABD

inb4 you come at me with Chris Morris or Shivam Dube, take a look at what happened to SRH who were 160-0. 

And I see comments calling Kohli a shit player. This pitch is not that easy to bat on and is getting slower. But no keep your knees ready to be jerked.",11
Ok after that can AB pls come back to the big meme league? For the whole season though,6
Would like to use my cake day to moan about how Kohli celebrating that outside edge has irrationally annoyed me,8
"I'd like to see Banton do well, but I worry he'll get found out. The dimensions of Sharjah should help him though.",2
"As someone said earlier, slow pitches does really bring the slow minds to the front",6
"It seems that it is harder to hit spinners here, I guess Sundar and Chahal are in play here",7
Excited for gill and banton opening. Legggoo,6

LOL Finch himself said maybe he should have gotten out earlier!,5
Aakash Chopra and Ashish Nehra were 3rd class players and now even lower grade commentators,5
I don’t think Kohli will do well in Sharjah,-2
Finch needed an IV drip after running with Virat.,3
Whoever dropped finch on 19 saved kkr.,15
RCB are about 20 runs short.. what do you folks think?,1
ABD saved Kohli's ass today lol,5
"ABD playing on a different pitch here!! 

Absolutely smoked and destroyed KKR!!",13

"Really hoping Russell blasts today... Dude has been under performing this season. If he gets going today, there is no way in hell RCB is gonna take this game  from KKR",5
What happened to mayanti?,5
83 runs in last 5 overs,7
"Now that my ego has been crushed after DC’s defeat yesterday, I can actually see other teams more clearly. RCB still seems like RCB though...",4
Why did RCB remove a batsman and added a bowler in Sharjah?,5
"Man you guys are so harsh. Kohli faced 7 balls in the last four overs. 16-20 is when he really took off last match, but he just didn’t have the opportunity this time.",7
"Slow wicket, think Sundar will be a handful. Chahal relies on larger boundaries so might not be as effective.",3
"Just to clear up something I've seen said a few times.

Most sixes at Sharjah are above 75-80 metres but this is because batsmen are comfortable swinging because they don't get caught when they only hit the ball 65 metres. They're more likely to take risks because they know even a miscue is more likely than not to clear the ropes.

So although, the majority of sixes are sixes anywhere, it's the minority that would be caught that also go for six here that is the 'problem'.",9
"Pitch is slow, that ABD innings should be the difference unless someone from KKR can replicate it.

But they bat deeper today and Russell is due a big knock, so I am still nervous.",10
RCB have to bowl well. AB's innings has raised the score by min. 25-30 runs.,5
Banton was pretty shit on the slow pitches during the PSL right? The reverse Ben Dunk who hasnt scored a BBL run in 3 years but looked like a GOAT in the PSL,7
"Guys lets not shit on Kohli, he had a bad day today.",-1
Prasidh should bowl 2-3 overs in death,1
"Aaron Finch says once the ball got softer it was tough to get it away. ""AB showed his class. He put the pressure back on the opposition without doing much different. *Maybe I should have got out earlier.* We were aiming at 180 and hoping to get to 190-195 so we have got that competitive total.""

Don't say thay Finchy even Kohli was struggling with this slow pitch....ABD is Mr360,  MrAllWeather, MrEveyPitchIsGoodPitch etc....",12
"The reason kohli wasn't smashing is probably because his partner was. He just ran between wicket and protected his end.

Nothing wrong with that.",13

RCB will win if they really shifted their fortune to KXIP,5
"Commentators have always been dramatic, its part of their job to build he excitement. But this years commentary has been disgusting. Kohli has struggled on this wicket but commentators have been just praising him to no ends. Also no regard to KKR keeping it tight for most of the innings. Have seen same with Dhoni.",10
"r/cricket experts - Abd gets out at 0 in last match , he is no more like he used to be  . He should be dropped.",25
Uff siraj please don't disappoint,2
"A little disappointed not getting 200 after being at 188 w 4 balls to go, but good recovery overall 

Kind of crazy that RCB have been as good as they have without Finch doing well in a single game. Could mean finch needs to be dropped, but if Finch plays as he’s shown he can, this team could be unstoppable",3
Siraj's bowling is gonna be crucial today,3
Even when Kohli's struggling he does it so well,13
Save some Saini overs for Dre Rus please,7
ABD never fails to amaze me. A strike rate of 220+ when everyone else was scoring almost run a ball. Simply outstanding!,17
"Uff r/cricket is really dumb

Kohli didn't even play much after the 14th over, lol, stop your whining guys",18
Top 10 mistakes of my life: Kept Kohli as my dream 11 captain instead of AB.,15

If kkr can't chase this on a tiny ground with an extra batsmen then they don't deserve the playoffs,6
"Which ipl was your favorite? Mine is 2016

Both RCB and KKR praying that Siraj doesn't disappoint.,14
"Imagine kl playing kohli innings, even though his team is without middle order. He would still be mocked more",8
Siraj will be the game changer tonight the question is for what team?,4
You know Dada has balls because he promotes a rival gambling app despite being bcci chief when Dream 11 is the title sponsor of IPL,15
ABD still the GOAT.,6
"Not the pitch for Yorkers as there is very little margin for error, only back of length and cutters seem to be working.",1
Just tuned in. That's a rather pathetic innings from Kohli considering the fact that we're in Sharjah.,-3
"Without ABD’s knock today, RCB might have been 30 runs short.",11
"Lol Russell this year has been absolute shit he is a non factor this match 

The only player of significance is Morgan imo

DK is mostly shit 

Gill cannot play at a SR more than 130

Rana is KKR's Samson",3
"**Most runs scored in an innings in last 5 overs in IPL**

68 (20 balls) - Andre Russell, KKR v CSK (2018)

67 (23 balls) - Rishabh Pant, DD v SRH (2018)

**65 (24 balls) - AB de Villiers, RCB v KKR (2020)**",9
Reminder - Siraj is sixth bowler.,7
Unpopular opinion: i would actually take Kohli’s captaincy over Iyer’s captaincy for DC. Kohli is more aggressive and trusts the fast bowlers more so he would have absolutely killed it with Rabada and Nortje. Where as Iyer’s just bowls them when the match is already over (won or lost).,6

Rcb always have to send him after 10 overs no matter how many wickets fell within 10 overs.",7

"People using the fact that Kohli barely had the strike towards the end

Fuck bro its been 2 overs and everyone already complaing about strike rate,8
No washi in powerplay?,3
Here he comes,1
Siraj announcing arrival in style with a half volley,7
BRING IN SUNDAR,4
Oh no. Lord Siraj is here,6
Lord cometh,1
Tripathi should have opened instead of Gill.,3
"Banton agreeing with Vaughan about looking to get in the test side, but knows the key to Ed Smith's heart is white ball performances",10
Finch just lost half his body weight,5
"Bruh Banton, start playing",5
So it begins,2
Lord Siraj 🙏,3
Waiting for Thala Gill to play a classic 50(45),4
Sara Jokes ain't stoppin till Gill bats,2
Can't ask every player with a low strike rate to get out just because the batting line up is deep....especially after 2 overs smh,5
Thirsty people fuck off . Talk about cricket.,9
Powerplay seemd like the best time to bat in the first innings so this is a bit of a icky start from KKR.,2
"Banton, please don't do a D'Arcy",10
"Cometh the time, Cometh the man - Siraj",3
Thank god for not showing that fan,8
Amazed that rcb are playing with 4 frontline pacers and 1 medium pacer,5
Big swing no ding,3
If rcb can get at least 3 economical overs from Siraj that would be a win,8
Why does someone with 9+ economy rate play for India in T20? Am I missing something?,3
Siraj spitting 🔥,4
Bantoff,3
Sirajs bouncer > Sainis bouncer,5
Fuck we're shitting our pants,2
Tripathi gets hard done by again,7
"On one hand, I want the newcomer young guy to do well, but on the other..",4
Banton. If you can't hit Siraj then F is inevitable.,7
I'm supporting KKR but Gill needs to get out so these Sara Tendulkar jokes would stop.,12
Siraj with a good bouncer.....,2
Trying to force it a bit at the moment,1
Nice backing up finch.,2
Fair play by banton,7
Siraj removes his mask after the game to reveal it was Steyn all along,14
Lord bowling 3 dots. I CAN’T BELIEVE MY EYES,12
WTF!!!! Why didn't they run the extra run?,7
Bantnerves,3
Every fukin bowler is abled to bowl 150 in this match,3
Why didn’t KKR go for the extra run,3
There was a 2nd there lol,4
Kolkata inching up the fair play table.,6
Banton looks like younger Noah from Dark,4
Fair play,5
Small PP for KKR lol,2
KKR going for that fair play award by not taking the extra run,10
[deleted],1
Kkr is losing this. Shubman either doesn’t understand his role in big chases or isn’t able to execute it.,5
WC finals flashback,5
Blessed Cred ad banner without that annoying dancing fan,6
3 more overs like that and I might have to start calling him Lord unironically.,19
Siraj to r/cricket- Bol na ab lawde,9
England would have won the world cup if they were playing now and that happened.,2
BC this is 2020 Siraj going for 4 runs in pp.,2
Shubhman blocks the ball dude. Blocks. Bollocks.,3
Sir Siraj Hadlee is bowling well i see,9
Tuk tuk Shubhman is here.,2
"Judging by the 1st over, siraj is playing for RCB today",4
I don't get the Sara refrences? Anyone,4
Fair play award sealed.,3
Is it still the spirit of cricket if it goes off the umpire’s leg?,3
Siraj has really improved his control.,1
Kkr fair play award👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽,4
This is not how you chase down a 195 target. Rrr is already 11,2
"Udana might come in handy today,the pitch looks like it’s getting slower and he’s got plenty of slower ones",5
Siraj has nice hair,8
"KKR, what are you doing?",3
Wow great banter this,2
Not sure if bowling Sundar on this pitch is a good idea,2
Siraj showing that agression,4
Shubman really needs to start scoring faster. He has been batting too slowly this season.,3
"Sanjay Bangar doesn't know where Belgavi is? Bitch, its my hometown.",5
Man I can't keep up with all these matches,4
Holy shit it's 9:43 already. I had dozed off after a tiring day of workout and studies. It's the first game of the ipl this season I missed(well only half). Feels bad but whatever.,13
I N T E N T,3
Tripathi was in good form why not open with him to give a fast start,6
Ugly hack for 4,2
"OOTL, what's up with these Sara jokes?",6
Why some people here copy paste a lot. Just type what's on your mind.,3
"This is some shambolic batting lol 

People would have called for dhoni's head if he played like this",9
Depends on how hard it hit the umpire and how off the throw was,5
I understand playing yourself in but they need to take advantage of the ball being hard,4
"Sanjay: ""first sign of InTeNt""",10
How do so many people even know that it's Sara's birthday today anyway? People are weird.,18
Karthik Intent Word Count- 4,13
Lmao did Kohli just said to umpire *abey chutiye*,20
INTENT,4
Saini got away with that poor ball,5
"I want Gill to get out, partly cause I support RCB but more importantly cause I want to stop seeing Cringy Sara-Gill jokes here...",14
KP wtf😂😂,3
Does siraj have more control than saini?,3
Need a sequence counter for I N T E N T,3
Can he bowl a leg stump half volley like that at Banton please,5
Udana should have taken one more step there. Would have been a boundary.,2
Though isuru would just walk on the boundary cushions,2
"KP commentary started pack: Some batsman, some bowler, some fielder, some shot, some pace, some catch",7
Tripathi died for this,15
Hope this match will calm all those asking for Banton to start. Hasn't done anything special so far,2
"Banton playing a Nikhil Naik opening innings

Edit: got his stumps uprooted, perfection",9
Excellent lengths by Siraj,3
Hope Banton goes the Bairstow way rather than Colin Ingram way,10
"I am seeing very few Sara jokes.
I AM however seeing lots of people complaining about it.",4
"Soo many options for Kohli

Udana, Morris, Saini, Siraj, Chahal, Sundar and Dube.

Super decision to go with extra bowler today",10
Give Udana one,2
Giving your sixth bowler second over. 189 IQ move,2
We Indians are so cringe about people dating.,21
Lucky charm of KKR - King Khan is here,3
What a nice start to this session... They need to see off this fiery session from Saini and they can start scoring more 1s and 2s post lunch. Test cricket is best cricket!,25
"Everyone baying for Gill’s blood, he’s striking higher than Banton",2
Banton more like Banter rn,2
"Is banton one of the most overrated players right now? No real performance of note other than against pak, average stats, and seems to be a flat track bully",0
Gill chooses to play so safe. Zero risk,3
Gill has an uncanny ability to avoid hitting in the gaps lol,8
What a ball,1
Ripper from SAINI,2
"calm down guys, kkr have a very strong batting lineup, if they start the carnage this total will be a piece of cake",6
Saini you Beauty,6
Banton hype dead,4
RIP Banton,5
Yayyy,2
"Is that KP commentating?

Why is IPL commentary so bad?

Talk about the game and pressure building up.
Wtf these idiots talking about",5
Narine and Tripathi died for this ¯\_ಠ_ಠ_/¯,11
Who's gonna come out when one of these 2 gets out?,3
Meme innings,5
Saini👌🏽,4
"Rip Banton

Good ball but Banton looked really nervy and didn't really go after anything anyway",16
Saini you beauty,3
Clear plan to bowl Udana to Russell,6

That was good,2
Narine warned for this,5
Russel Morgan can get 100 in the last 5,8
Both banton and Gill played in the same u19 world cup,7
Remember D'arcy short? Banton might end up with a similar season,7
148 KPH,8
I am happy with the wicket,7
"WTFFF, NOOOOOO BANTON :(",7
Nach bc,2
Dinesh Karthik with his twerk warm-up,2
Who else thinks Banton won't be picked anymore (unfairly) this season by KKR?,4
YES YES YES YES YES **YES**,3
Banter,3
Banton was the imposter....,11
Saini & Siraj both have improved by leaps & bounds in one year.,4
Australians are happy,4
"Thank you for your service, agent banton",3
Tommy no :(,2
Lol DK twerking at the back,2
r/cricket hyped and jinxed a player again. Now it's time to reverse jinx,7
Gill comes from Pandey's school of not hitting the gaps,4
Well this has been quite underwhelming from these two.,2

An Indian bowler getting an English with pace!!! Feast your eyes guys.,8
I don't think KKR are going to feel too bad about losing that wicket.,2
The word intent has been used a lot this IPL so far :),2
">!Haha where that Aussie Banton hater at?! Cheers, you spiteful cunt!!<",7
Tripathi died for this?,2
Do you think KKR will agree to a Phillipe- Banton Swap after today?,2

Narine is back baby!,0
Don't tell me some are writing Banton off after 1 innings?,7
But Jaiswal will still get dropped,3
Seen gill play in domestic and A level. He is known for hitting gaps but this ipl he's been finding the players almost everytime. Is it the quality of bowling or mental space?,3
Just realized that we really are missing the Imran Tahir wicket celebration this year. It's so iconic and it just struck me,6
Tom Banton is Narine of 2020 without bowling ability?,9
Banton pullin a uthappa 2.0,0
So this is the Banton r/cricket was so hyped for,3
I think i need to stop staying up for IPL. Everyone I want to watch either doesn't play or gets out for 8 off 10,9
"Everyone : Pitch slowed down... Bowl slow and restrict them from scoring

Saini: Fuck it bowl fast and uproot the stumps",15
Where is Tripathi?,1
Had Banton gone down swinging it wouldn't have been a problem,2
Another one for r/deathrattleporn,4
Kartik intent virus is spreading to the other commentators,3
Just don't get this ploy. Why send Banton over Tripathi if he gonna do a Gill. Just baffling.,2
"Lol what was the commentator saying? ""Ab is better than ..."" couldnt quite make out the last word",2
"An Indian bowler taking out an Englishman with a 148mph rocket...even though I'm a KKR fan, that's such a good sight to see for an Indian fan",16
"Don't know why ipl teams bid for English players. They are such bad players. Not a single one has succeeded. Peterson, stokes and archer are not technically English",1
Ishant Sharma if god forbid doesn't get fit for Aus tour. Saini should be the third seamer ahead of Umesh. He has natural back of length of test match.,7
Hope Tom doesn't get dropped just after one match,7
"You're telling me I consumed all that cider just for you to get out for 8?

I'll be having stern words with the Somerset gods for this",11
I'm afraid to look at my fitbit when Siraj bowls,7

"Jaiswal, Banton, all the youngsters. It takes years to establish a reputation, a position. Years of playing, persevering and so on.",5
Hey where's that RCB lucky charm guy? Are you watching mate?,5
"People who wanted Banton in place of Narine when he was down, look at this. Let the management decide cricket. We are ultra noobs.",5
That's a lovely shot from Rana,2
Goodness man. It's his first match cut him some slack.,8
[deleted],2
"My dad and elder brother are supporting kkr and I'm supporting rcb. Just want to point out that when the cricket is on, it's almost like their minds are connected. They yell ""out"" at the same time, ""shot"" at the exact same time, their hands go behind their heads in agony at the same time upon a wicket, they call a wide when they see one at the same time. They even choose to express themselves with the same words many times. I don't know where they learnt this black magic but it's really cute 🥺",4
Any reason Sundar isn't bowling in the powerplay?,4
Why does every run that Gill takes looks like a possible runout ?,3
How accurate as the speed gun looked? Saini and Sarah don't seem to be bowling THAT quick?,1
That was Raina’s shot but better timed,4
Int fucking tent!!,1
Anyone else feels investment in young foreign batsmen is futile unless they're proven \m/,6
Was supporting KKR but I don't care who wins Banton got out at shit my day is made lol,5
Saini's dismissal of Banton was test! Just enough of the seam. Lovely stuff.,5
"Rana is more Raina, than Raina himself",7
Kohli put himself in the slips just to be closer to AB.,14
"Classic Sixraj, placing a slip and bowling down the leg.",5
Curse of Sunil Narine in full flow,4
Why does a team stacked with batsman playing conservatively at the start,3
"I hope Rana does not throw away his wicket today after scoring 15-20

He has looked good almost everyday, but got out cheaply",4
When did Siraj start bowling at 144kmph?,5
Why are they throwing every ball at the stumps,4
"Why is everybody so afraid to hit the ball in the air? A ten year old can clear this boundary, just have some intent",7
Rana has I N T E N T,5
[deleted],7
You dont attack with siraj. You defend and then you pray,9
Banton replaced Narine so he decided to bat like him this year,5
Siraj looks like much improved now. Hope i don't jinx him now.,20
Koach gives me tsundre vibes towards abd 👉👈,3
Siraj is back in form?,9
Its just **INTENT**,4
"At the end of this match, 1 of the 2 teams playing today will join MI & DC at the top of the table. Just doesnt make me feel like both of these teams have played as the same level as MI & DC.",10
Siraj looks a far better bowler this season,11
Whole Tendulkar family just clapped in joy,9
New phrase for having wank: *disturbing your furniture*,6
Where Washington,3
Siraj at it again,6
Lord Siraj redemption,7
Pick me ball,2
Feel bad for all those car owners filling insurance forms.,5
Lord Siraj bringing normalcy again,11
"Easy to say now but I’ve never seen banton play with such hesitation, defo nerves got the better of him",8
And the Lord is back,14
Nothing to see guys. Siraj doing siraj things,7
Ok thank you for your service Siraj,6
Siraj switching allegiances.,2
Start the Sara joke train again please,1
Simple rule for bidding in ipl. Bid for west Indian and south African players . Don't bid for English players!,10
Siraj reverting to type.,5
Virat forgot about Sundar again,4
We're on,2
Am I high or Was that Sara Tendulkar in the stands??,1
[removed],5
I don't think Rana will run when Gill calls. Fucker Gill gets everyone run out,6
"Fuck,  I jinxed Siraj. Sorry guys!",3
Siraj is back bois,3
Oh man Gill knew whatsup and just nudged it for six,0
Fuck. Replace Siraj with dube.,3
56 metre six lol,5
Pieraj strikes again! Kohli saying FML!,2
Why isn't Narine playing today? He can't be dropped after last game's match winning bowling,-2
In b4 Rana scores a 80+ knock and Reddit and Twitter lose their shit and GG is giving another warning about remembering a new name,12
Interesting RCB went with an extra bowler and KKR with an extra Batsmen. Let's see how it's pans out,2
[deleted],1
Bring sundar,2
Even after performing well up front tripathi lost his position :(,7
👀,1
Lord siraj,3
"The thing with Gill is that he finds difficult to shift gears but he has it in him to go bonkers from the word go. It's not like he's someone incapable of playing the big hits. Last match, he got caught in two minds and was not able to get too many balls away. Glad he's started positively today.",14
"But I thought Gill was shit, what happened /r/cricket?",13
20 runs of this over....,2
That's the 3rd over from 5th bowler,3
Betichod electricity cut,21
Siraj is back,6
Glad after that aberration of a first over Siraj is back in form.,9
"CMV: ABD just yelled ""Pussy""",12
What happened to Kohli today?,5
Vintage Siraj!,4
Kohli's usage of Sundar is retarded.Should have bowled a lot more in the powerplay.,5
I love hearing ABD behind the wickets,4
[deleted],6
[deleted],10
AB is mvp,11
Does anyone know if auto insurance has a provision for cricket ball sixes near stadiums? LOL,7
Let Rana play spinners,8
"Prophets of r/cricket: before proclaiming that any young bowler should be in the Indian XI, might wanna see them bowl a few more overs",18
If Kohli gets 4 overs from Sundar then Siraj doesn't need to bowl out even Saini. Udana and Morris at the death and Chahal against Russel.,13
Stop throwing the ball FFs. Unnecessary,8
"Am I only one who is little nervous when the ball goes to main road. Ball could hit someone going in bike, and it could end up in a disaster.",99
Sundar should complete his spell today please,10
this is good batting if youre chasing 140-150.,7
"To everyone making a mockery of The Lord and Saviour of RCB, Lord Siraj, you all will regret your words when he takes 9 wickets in nine deliveries.",17
"Kohli is the real imposter guys, he said there is a 6th bowler Siraj but didn't mention for whom.",3
Fuck that was a brutal South African accent by Swann,3
sundar's powerplay stats are incredible. 4.7 economy and only 3 boundaries conceded in 10 powerplay overs,9
"Prematch - Siraj in for Gurkeerat?  

Koach - It gives us additional bowling option. 

Reality - It ensures traditional RCB run leaking protocol. 

Sundar was doing brilliantly in power play. Why change it?",14
Is that Sara in the mask watching the game?,-6
Sundar has the best economy this season followed by Rashid,11
Why is Sundar so hard to play against?,14
KKR  need to send Dre Russ after next wicket. They need an innings to take attack to opposition. Then Morgan/DK can take them home. Otherwise its going be hard to win this one.,6
Rana looks a very elegant player until he has to face the chin music.,12
Timeout after 6 overs😂😂,7
How is sundar so good?,9
Everytime we think bowling sundar isn't going to work out and it does every time,12
Umpire forcing VK to take time out,5
Kolkata Thala academy knight riders,5
"Would have loved to see, sehwag play Washington",5
So Sundar should have bowled,5
Good to see Siraj is still shit. Some things never change.,5
Guys is that Sara that we just saw in the camera??,-3
"Kohli seems to be captain in name only, it's AB who is setting the field and advising the bowlers what to bowl",-2
"Imagine if instead of udana, we had someone like rabada or nortje",2
[removed],2
Sundar is a real Sundar lad eh?,0
Washington is Sundar,6
ABD not loud enough for me to get over my Pant hangover :(,6
Unfair on Tripathi. He would have relished opening on this stadium. Poor guy always gets a second class treatment despite performing well.,12
[deleted],11
"KKR taking it Deep, and by deep i mean Deep from the boys s02, because I have no idea what they are trying to do, but it definitely does not help the main story (that is trying to win the match)",3
Why tf is Tripathi not playing?,1
Waiting for Gill to give a couple of wrong calls,-5
"Is there any other sport that can cause damage to the outside public? Maybe baseball but other than that?

Edit: how could I forget that racing literally decapitates the spectators",8
Sundar has an economy of 4.79 in 19 overs this IPL. Yes he almost never completes his spell Let that sink in!,24
mother-lover™ dhawan,12
We all keep underestimating Sundar and he keeps delivering,8
Holy shit RCB are actually gonna qualify this season hahaha,5
Why you gotta do my boy Tripathi dirty like that tho,16
"Sundar is where Ashwin was at early on in his career. Making a name for himself as a power play specialist. 

Most spinners avoid bowling in powerplay (a tough ask for spinners in general). Only a few can take up that role and turn it to their advantage.",12
"I still feel the 2014 IPL finals is the right way of chasing 200. KKR kept a RRR under 10 every over. This is just plain playing enough to pray that Russell gets 80 off 5. Chahal, Udana and Sundar left.",8
[removed],-35
"After hours of thinking and consideration, I finally decided to boy a lux cozi baniyan and flaunt my man boobs to my family",23
Power ahead with great learning,4
"Fair Play Champions, you'll never sing that",7
How the fuck did they manage to get the pre recorded audience out of sync with the countdown lmao,12
Guys what about Parthiv playing as keeper anyway Gurkeerat isn't getting any chance and ABD in the field is gold?,11
"I swear the way you guys talk about keepers telling bowlers what to bowl

Bowlers do have their own brains and do analysis and make plans for matches",7
Still flustered thinking about that ball by Saini,3
Rajasthan is last in Fair Play because it's unfair to play the Lord against mortals,16
RCB is winning,7
"Sundar bowling only 1over in power play. 

Is virat thinking to complete siraj quota or is Sundar going to bowl to Russel ?",5
Stop dicking around like it's a test game,2
Fair play award is calculated like reddit karma. No one knows has any idea what the algorithm is.,6
Rana is a perfect candidate for a typical Chahal out side off stump flooter.,4

Chris Morris has to be the worst looking player in the ipl right?,-12
Gill is everything that Prithvi should be trying to be,10
Please don't get them out,2
Tripathi sat for these idiots,3
Gill is middling them now. Perfect time to start going aerial,1
what a snoozefest chase so far. really disappointing.,1
Fielded,2
I think Chahal is underrated. 100+ wickets and less than 8rpo and most of them in Chinnaswamy.,7
Siraj or prime Jonty Rhodes?,7
Am i watchin the highlights of last years match in eden gardens,4
ABD is great and all but he still has to learn how to talk peak shithousery from Pant,7
I think they'll accelerate after the tea,6
Siraj what the fuck,5
Why did King Kohli bat so slow today? What was his plan?,-6
Good fielding Siri,4
I am so done with this match,0
Pitch seems difficult to bat on. Maybe ABD played a freak innings instead of Kohli playing badly?,10
Chahal's fiance could easily overpower him in bed,9
Lord Siraj with the excellent fielding,2

Washington Vetrivel is our 500 crore rupee treasure.,5
Man nehra is no fun,5
Aalaporaan tamizhan!,3
Rana is another fresh graduate of Thala ki patshala,7
SUNDAR OP,3
Lets go baby...,2
"Gill,Pandey,Dhawan,Finch are the new students of Thala Academy",8
What a ball yaar Washy!,6
Dw lads Nitish scores a 50+ next game and he will be back in the reckoning as India's #4 /s,4
my mom and I just had a good laugh over kohli’s behenchod,8
All four wickets bowled today,6
"this game is gone. Time to play for NRR, KKR",1
Rana is useless,3
Washy and Ashwin deserve a run in the Indian T20 side imo,1
"Nehra the visiting dugout guru has my respect. Take a bow, good sir!",1
"Knocked him over!!!
Ati Sundar!!",1
"For those shitting on Gill, he has the 2nd highest SR in this match till now (after AB).",1
Loan Sundar to Lanka/Bangladesh where he can actually get game time.,1
I rather see Rana there than Morgan,2
KKR really needs to stop playing Rana. This guy has been so bad so far. Man's turning into Uthappa by the day!,4
"Jeez, Kohli calm down",4
"Ashish Nehra can go to hell

Mitochondria is the power house of the cell",7
Realized all 4 wickets in the match uptill now were bowleds,4
"Man Sundar is so economical, He is going to be in huge demand if he keeps this consistent bowling.",8
Sundar has been then best RCB bowler by a mile this season,6
"Love the MG Gloster ad. It's very ear, eye and temper friendly",3
Do you think rcb will retain washi next year?,7
"Banton 8 from 12, Rana 9 from 14

lmfao finch,3
Lol Finchy,2
Ffs fatty,2
 Dropping a sitter .wat was that finch,5
Oh finchy,6
no u didn't just do that Finchy..,4
Rana played a shitting innings. after hitting a 4 in his 1st ball he struggled and got out while taking RR to crazy level. Unfortunately they did not send Dre Russ to push things. I think this match is almost gone for KKR.,2
Mate mate mate mate,2
Inb4 Morgan hits a 20 ball 50 and the subreddit collectively creams it's pants,5
aaron finch about to get toasted by r/cricket,4

How was that dropped?!?!?!!,5
"Rana and Gill, best pair❤️",1
Finch you fucking arsehole. Fuck off.,3
FINCH NOOOOOO,3
Looks like r/cricket will need to make a Kohli apology thread after this match.,3
"RCB should retain

Oh no Finchy,5
Wtf Finch,3
can't clear 50m boundaries😒,3
Fuck you finchy!,3
Finch you turd,5
We are at top of table in dropped catches,7
RCB Drop a catch a match is going strong,6
RCB are making it to the Final this year,2
Finchy man. Gill will go ballistic now,7
Finchy you mongrel..!!!,4
Oh RCB dropped the match there,3
Denzel was so enamored with off-spin bowling that he changed his surname to Washington.,6
Finch saved that boundary what a man,6
Collapse avoided due to the drop.,4
Finch. You had one job.,9
Wondering how a Koach and Finch MC BC fight would look like.,3
Lockdown has affecting fielding a lot more than expected,3
Swann would be a great shitposter on r\cricket,3
Finch didn't want to disappoint someone on their bday.,5
The main reason I watch RCB matches is to see Virat's face for dropped catches,9
IF THATS NOT BBL FIELDING I DONT KNOW WHAT IS,2
Oh no Delhi flashbacks,1
Finchy pinchy,3
Kohli to Finch - Kuch to kar le bc!,5
Finch has had enough running for today,2
This is out lol,2
"If it's not off the bat then surely it's LBW?

Edit: missing by a mile lmao",3
DRS,1
They need play Sharjah like Sharjah,1
"KKR's last 6 matches : LWWLWW

They were gonna lose anyway. To keep the pattern going.",5
Damn review wasted maybe,2
Morge has the best poker face around,4
That’s out,3
"Sundar might get man of the series at this rate

Unbelievable bowling",9
That could be very costly,5
Kohli is disappointed with his batting today and is considering a career in mime,4
Kohli and wasting reviews..,7
Who is the Indian commentator in dogout?,3
We have a new word -- GUILT^^TM,11
It's kohli who took the DRS so we can be assured that it's not getting overturned,7
Chahal is that guy who says everything confidently even though he is not sure.,14
Umpire- Nice and Slow has same Vibes as EASYEASYEASY,6
"the two irish bois together now, morgan and gill",7
Amazing umpiring. 😓,5
The only big change with RCB this year is they're letting Washington sundar bowl his quota of overs.. and that has made a lot of difference,8
HBW,3
Lmao,6
Idiotic review,2
Hbw?,3
How is it pitching so high?,8
Wtf was that bounce,10
He could be LBW like Tendulkar..,5
Way too high! NOT OUT,2
Any idiot can convince Kohli to take a review,14
[removed],2
Ok how much did that spin wow,6
Sundar reminds me of Ashwin in the old csk days. Just an absolute bank,8
GOTE MUH ME AAAGAYE THE,6
Umpiring 101,2
Oh no,4
"Dugout today isn't a comms box, it's a peanut gallery",5
[deleted],14
When did HBW come into the rules?,-1
Oh review lost,3
Swann shitting on the third umpire >>>,3
Sundar has an ER of 4.8 this season,3
Fuck show that footage to Glenn McGrath and all of Australia. Tendulkar wasn't out..,10
Start hitting guys :'(,3
This was such a dumb review,4
"On field umpire is like, told you bitch.",5
"Finch dropped it intentionally just to have fun chat with Tim Paine back in Aus. 




Paine : "" Remember that face of Kohli when you dropped that catch hahah""



Finch: "" Yeah he was like ohhh we lost the WC this is RCB , fuck off mate this is my 8th team you gonna throw me out? """,33
Ah yes the mandatory RCB doing RCB things phase,8
That's criminal from Finch,10
"Checking for lbw when the appeal is for caught shouldn't be a thing

Imagine returning a test for rechecking and getting fucked in a different answer",8
Can you get out by LBW if it hits your arm?,7
Could have been out if Kohli made a better T,7
Gill needs to do something about that strike rate. Puts too much pressure on the other batsmen ffs,1
"Blind Koach blindly goes for review, 
ABD can't view 360, he can hit 360",4
What was that review?😂,3
I think review was for caught behind not lbw??,6
"Captains always get all the hate for wasting DRS, but bowlers who convince them also deserve some.",14
That was straight out of the Philander Academy of DRS,5
Intent😂😂😂,5
"Feel like Nehra tries to be descent in commentary, but dugout is a place to go crazy.",8
"Lappa ghumao na plx

T: Start hitting plx",2
Finch’s drop made them agitated,5
This is some proper retarded batting from kkr,2
Wtf Nehraji comparing chahal to warne,3
Karthik Intent Word Count(Updated)- 5,2
Didn't that hit the glove though ?,2
Perhaps RCB should seriously look at dropping Finch.,1
These guys are not showing I N T E N T,9
"Fucking hell every other word coming out of these guys' mouths is ""intent"", like we get it can you shut up now",8
I knew they were gonna hype themselves and lose the review and it did happen. Should had kept that for Russell,2
Abd is so animated in the field!,5
Drinking game idea: take a shot every time Kevin Peiterson says intent.,2
"Say intent one more time. I dare you, I double dare you motherfucker!",5
Imma drink a shot of vodka every time Kartik says the word Intent,3
How is the pitch guys?,3
Is this woman idiotic? How is Gill the senior player here? I'm all for women representation but you can't just bring any munni from the gully cricket scene to commentary,13
"KKR should’ve never won against CSK or KXIP. Those matches were gifted to them. Considering that, they haven’t been good this tournament",1
Someone's gotta hit in this innings,2
I want to hug Chahal 🤗,8
">We will have a review, thanks

-Kohli",3
Drinking game idea: take a shot every time Kevin Peiterson says intent.,1
KKR looks clueless,2
Two more over of chahal will be fun,2
Of course you'd enjoy a roly poly Swanny.,2
FFS we are losing this match with this 6rpo run rate.,2
The keyword for this year's IPL is 'Intent'. The amount of times this word has been used to way too high.,13
Wtf is with everyone dropping sitters this season,2
Nice to see chahal back in form. He was awful last year throughout.,1
DBW- Dick Before Wicket,2
"KKR fans relax, we know how to lose it from here, have done it many times, at least twice against KKR themselves. Have faith.",2
b..bu..but kOhLi PlAyEd SlOw DAE XDDD,8
We should've brought in another spinner.,1
Do Swann and Nehra have some kind of love hate relationship?,3
RRR is a joke already start swinging you fuckers,7
Russell gonna come in when the rrr is 18,3
I think ABD innings was an abberation on this pitch.,9
Gill mf do something,4
r/cricket is the only Indian sub where everyone is nice and non-political. Thanks guys 👍👍,9
"If Kkr continues to play like this, they're about to be thrashed in their next game",4
Purple was the imposter..,2
KKR have been very patchy. They were bailed out by Dhoni-Jadhav and KXIP in last 2 games. This is not surprising.,6
"I'm worried it's gonna get to 80+ of 5 overs needed, before the RCB choke™",8
ABD giving me hope with his catch it,7
"Losing a review could be a very big mistake, especially how shitty the umpiring has been",4
Man I cant imagine how tired abd must be with that kind of batting and all this athleticism when keeping,18
i N t E n T,8
Many mystery spinners get figured out.... there's nothing ti figure out with W.sundar....simple and straight....pure line length bowler,11
"Run rate almost at 13 with 11 overs remaining. Leaving too much for Russel, aren't they!",1
"Everyone you hear   I N T E N T

Take a peg!",3
Morgan 1 off 5 lol,5
so funny seeing kohli next to morgan couldn’t be more different,1
Thats out,1
"Chahal economy rate 3, Sundar 4. Is this T20 or a fast Test match?",7
Obv out,3
Fuck yass,3
Thats gone,3
Beautiful work abd,5
OUT,4
Dude who says he prefers a better economy rate than wickets is giving the batsmen shit for not showing “intent”.,5

Chahal and Sundar pairing might just be stronger than Axar and Ashwin or Krunal and Chahar.,4
Morgan sold him down the river!!,1
Maybe sundar will change kohli's disregard for off spinners,7
Abd is 36... Inhuman,6

Maybe we treated CSK too harshly. So many teams are chasing like this,3

Fuck",3
"Fucking hell, what are we doing?",5
"RCB trying to get Russel out in the middle before they choke.

Fairplay",6
Karma bitch.,5
"Lmao

Gill 🤝 run-outs",16
Gill got the karma from last game,4
So these guys wanna play out the spinners so they can hit Morris and saini? Nah. Bad idea.,3

UMPIRE WTF,6
Umpire is doing some *nice and slow*,5
Man I love Swanny on the comms,6
AB you are a gem,10
It should read: Gill run out (Morgan),13
Unpopular maybe but dugout is pretty shit.,-4
Is Swann shitting on 3rd ump?,8
"Great pick up by abd.
Now please get big DiK on.",8
A curse in Disguise.,4
So refreshing to see Washi play! So young and so talented <3,5
What the fuck this guy is 36,20
Stumps broken for all 5 wickets as of now,9
"I just want a high scoring game at Sharjah, the other venues can be bowler friendly",5
KKR should be happy. Tuk Tuk player gone,4
We're making up for the last 2 matches here,6
"GG RCB, I'm out",5
Unpopular opinion but DK should have come instead of Morgan since it was going to be 8 overs of spin.,9
Sweet sweet throw!,6
Finally a commentator calling out the third umpire for the bullshit time-wasting. You go Swanny!,19
"AbD is a national treasure, and he ain't even from India",54
"Gone by a mile, not even in the frame",6
AB could excel at any sport he tries his hand in. In this particular timeline he chose cricket.,13
Wtf what do you think he did. Put it in his pocket smh,9
Suicidal,5
Hello darkness my old friend,2
Food for thought- Are the Advantages of a Successful Anchor inning's more valuable/harmful than the Disadvantages of a Failed Anchor inning's?,8
"AB 'fast hands' DeVilliers

P. S. His wifey is lucky  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)",10
"Y 3rd umpire!!!🙄🙄

Legendary umpiring",6
Game Over. Good Night Everyone :'(,3
Is Isuru today's Gurkeerat?,0
This might be good thing for KKR Gill needs to work on his Range hitting. Learn from that poor fielder Shaw.,9
I'm surprised he didn't check front view to verify ABD's legs didn't dislodge the bails first.,7
When will udana bowl?,3
Ok so that drop didn't affect us much,7
">Ananthapadmanabham

Swanny: I won't even pretend to spell his name 😅",9
I don't understand the purpose of on field umpire when almost everything is going for third umpire.,8
What is the point of this square leg umpires? All of them just stand like scare crows and refer everything to the third umpire?,5
Russel gonna score another single digit today kkr have lost this,5
'Anantha thapathapatham' - Graeme Swann,11
The square leg umpire should not get his per diem allowance today. Fucking lazy,2
Watching Washi is like watching sped up footage of a bowler,1
[deleted],0
Swanny needs to be the third umpire in at least one match.,7
They should’ve sent Russ in,2
I think too much of Swann can be a bad thing... Swann and Nehra together are really painful to listen to..,10
The quicksand chase. Slowly but surely it’s sinking,2
Man goes to IPL to get away from that Pakistan vs. England carnage. Guess this runout is my fucken welcome card,4
Square leg umpire had his eyes fixed on the Altroz,4
KKR gonna be inducted into the Thala academy for today's BATDEEP game,8
Dk getting out early today at deep mid wicket isn't he ?,5
Where the hell is Tripathi bc!,9
The boys are in top form today. Let's get that NRR baybee,5
Hoping DK is gonna do a Dhoni here,5
Finch's tactical drop of Gill followed by Morgan's tactical run out of him.,9
"Man, who are these imposters in the RCB kit? What happened to the real RCB?",9
Nice shot!,2
"Sometimes I wonder what must have been going through Sundars parents' mind when they named him ""Washington""",11
When is the T20 world cup? They'll pick SKY after his recent performances right?,0
If dhoni had effected that runout the commentators would have still been jizzing.,3
DJ forgot to play the crowd cheer for that boundary,2
"Sundar is perplexed, how someone can hit him for boundary!! Lol",12
Just an FYI: Rahul 'the opener' Tripathi is also in the 11,8
Foakes would have caught that.,4
oof morgs better play a blinder now,2
"These guys always start off their batting playing test cricket and then turn into a batting collapse. Only person that has been saving us so far has been Narine and we don't even have him anymore. Idk why they think they can take the rrr to over 15 an over and still win the game, specially since Russell is so out of form. I am so done with this team, we don't deserve to be top 4 right now.",0
Who should they choose to bowl to Russel?/,2
Udana is a good fielder for a fast bowler!,8
Nehra is more fun in hindi,1
So RCB is no longer haarcb?,1
A rare boundary from Morgan against Ethical Jnr.,3
I feel sad for Lara having to tolerate bs Nehra spews,-1
Gill made 34 off 25 while others so far have done diddly squat. Hard to please this sub.,16
"I don't know what it is or why it is, but when I search for Dinesh Karthik on Google, the first image I see is of him doing [something curious and strange...](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Dinesh.Karthik.jpg/1200px-Dinesh.Karthik.jpg)",9
"Fuck off Swann, what a twat",0
DK hopefully exhausted his 1 Nidahas innings per tourney,1
"Dinesh ""one good inning per IPL"" Karthik",5
Isuru being reserved for russell,5
***beep beep beep*** Gill was An Impostor.,2
ABD is Krishna and kohli is arjuna.,1
DK facial hair is not elite. Dud innings confirmed,3
So Gill is a fraud.,2
KKR are atleast batting better than CSK,0
Tears rolling down my eyes looking at rcb being such a complete team,5
Sundar bowling 2 overs after PP : is this for real?,2
Even brownie with tomato ketchup sounds more fitting than Washington and Sundar together,2
RR is hitting sky high now. Its now or never KKR.,2
Fake-real skipper and actual-on-the-field Skipper batting... watch the testosterone fly.,4
Need to attach with Saini as well,2
[deleted],3
Gill will be their best player tonight.,0
Makes no sense to send Russell under 10 overs. He hardly runs and they have already seen that it won't work. Better to have him for last 5-6 overs,3
Gee why is Udana in this team lol,1
"Man whats even the point of Tripathi in this XI, theyre probably just gonna send cummins ahead of him anyway",1
Battle between 2 heads of leadership group of kkr now,2
"Shubhman Gill reminds me of Unmukt Chand. He even fooled Viv Richards in saying "" I think Unmukt Chand is future of Indian cricket, great technique"".",4
"As a KKR fan, I love how everyone is going through a mental breakdown, like chill guys",1
"RCB controlled it well first 10 overs. Lets see what happens next. DK, Thripati and Russel are still there",2
"RCB bowling looks class this team , batting wise they are always good , could be their year. We have memed them to become good this year",5
Chahal and washi have been exceptional so far.,2
80 in last 5 is chaseable,4
This will end like the Morgan and Tripathi innings.,1
Isuru still didn't bowl his first over!,5
Till Russell is there we can't be sure of anything. I still have vivid memories of last year's game.,4
"KKR this is a T20 match, not an ODI :'(",5
This is spirited RcB bowling line up...not the meme team we know of...they will probably even choke Russell...,4
abe is DJ ko koi hatao.. BC shouts in an empty ground..so annoying..,2
"I want Steve Smith to go to Australia after the IPL and keep chiming ""kya plan hai"" at random times during the Ind-Aus tour in the Australian dressing room.",12
DK has the Random Team-Order Generator,17
Take that,3
lol tf 🤡,2
Holy GOD.Yuzi,7
"RCB have a tendency to bring opposition batsmen into form

Russell has struggled so far in the series 

You know how this is going to end",20
Oh DK :(,3
Why dk why,4
Hahahahahaha. Get fucked kkr.,8
Damn 😍,3
"Bad idea dude!!

Get him out after he plays 10-12 balls.",10
"Yikes

KKR are naff",2
What is going on guys(and gals)😂😂,0
Wow. It's a choke guys.,2
Pitch really has been balanced as fuck. It’s a miracle ABD and Finch even crossed 40 here.,4
LMAO Dinesh Karthik,2
"Fucking hell, this is shambolic.",2
"Only luck can win KKR matches, intent and talent is for shit",9
Proper Dinesh innings. Typical,3
"KXIP got watto in form, brought the Lord out of Tewatia & now it's time for RCB to help Russel bro out",6
Dinesh not-nidhas-today karthik!!,9
Oh thank god,2

"Karthik gone
 

Game over unless Russell plays a Pollard type innings.",6

What a collapse.,6
KKR doing a RCB better than RCB ever did an RCB,20

"**10.3** Chahal to Karthik, OUT, played on. Chahal teases him with a wide slow legbreak **62-4**

"KKR has Ferguson, Ali Khan and Chris Green warming the bench. But they went in a bowler short and disrupted the batting over in one decision. BMac at it again.",2
DK hate comments incoming,6
Maaaannnnn this is amazing,2
KKR has still two batsmen to come,-1
Please don't choke now,8
RCB coming for that NRR,3
Yuzi is finally getting some DMs tonight 😏,2
BossDK's back!,-1
"Except for Gill, everyone else has been bowled today",6
RCB bowling winning matches... Now I can die in peace after seeing everything,8
NRR should get a boost today for RCB unless Russell plays spoilsport,2
"If they had stuck with Tripathi at the top, atleast they would have one player with intent",5
Now that anchor innings of Kohli feeling like Gold ❤️,4
Come on kkr you can't bat this deep!!,4
"Can't wait for Dre Russ 70*(20) to win it, seen RCB get smashed at the death too often",4
"Come on kohli give siraj few overs, we want an interesting match",5
Haha watch all the ppl apologizing to dk on that thread last game go back to roasting him,7
This pitch is just proof of ABD's greatness,9
What's up with RCB's bowling man? Holy shit. This is freaking awesome.,9
Kartik should only come when there’s less than 40 balls left .,4
"Karthik : I have done my bit for this IPL, no one can dare question me now",4
Slow wicket...AB d is an 👽....,3
"Kinda glad that this loss is coming against RCB, my second favourite team and not against MI or CSK.",6
Good Night,2
"How tf can abd play 70 off 30 in this pitch, GOAT",9
Told Y'all about DK and this facial hair,4
Our batting hasn't clicked at all this year.,2
Serves them right to fuck too much with the team order,2
i want Koach to high five me and scream YAAASSS BOISS whenever I do something productive.,3
Greame swann mocking third umpire everytime has become quite annoying. EVERY SINGLE TIME.,3
Maybe the pitch is actually very difficult to bat on?,2
get russell out and finish it off pls,2
"Finally Tripathi can play like he's opening the innings, coz all the top order has contributed ghanta.",2
Kolkata Luck Riders could be below CSK and KXIP. They aren't special. Points table can be misleading,1
DK realised this ain't Nidahas anymore,1
"RCB ON FIRE!!!!!!!! ^(Russel spare us please, go berserk next match)",5
Ah remember when everyone was criticising rcb for playing too slow?,4
Tripathi gonna come at 7 again,1
"That ""kya Plaan haai' from Steve Smith. lol",3
Why wouldn’t u send tripathi tf,2
Russell or bust for KKR now,2
Ugh.. feel bad for Karthik. Is his career over?,-1
Yuzi is such a wholesome bowler.. RCB are blessed to have him.. such a wholesome cricketer..,1
"after a complete shitshow of 2 years, finally rcb realized that they cannot play lord umesh and lord siraj together.",5
Liverpool and RCB winning the league in 2020.,4
After years of scrolling through different pace bowlers its kinda funny that RCB's bowling attack is finally clicking because of their spin attack.,2
Chad Chahal bullying virgin KKR.,2
Last year RCB lost 2 games against KKR because of rus.,2
SRK is thinking of buying Yusuf Pathan for 15cr in next auction,2
Russel will get out in single digit today.,1
Gonna need at least 50 runs in the next 5 overs without losing any more wickets to have any chance.,2
This match is not done yet.,0
Where the hell is Tripathi?,4
OK so how good was ABD innings?,6
Remember when people here were saying Kohli and AB were playing like shit and wasting balls? It's almost like world class batsmen out in the middle can read the pitch better than us sitting in our homes.,9
Should have sent tripathi. 10 overs is a bit too long for russel to bat imo,2
Interesting to see how Sundar bowls to russel,3
"DK poor guy, had no choice i guess. Had to go for it. But never fear, Russell is here. All is well. All is well...",5
How many balls until Russell starts to feel his hamstring,3
Never thought RCB will win a match by their bowling,0
RCB set up perfectly to disappoint us by losing in the 18th over.,4
So this is what it feels like to win. FeelsGoodMan,3
this HAS to be Russell's biggest innings if KKR needs to cum back,2
"Dare I say, is this the match where RCB NRR move to positive?",4
"If Russell plays 40 balls, KKR win",1
Relax. Russell is good but he nowhere near the form of last two years,2
"Yo I'm sorry for abusing you DK, always knew you were a legend.

Am I doing this right guys, should this be a separate thread or something.",6
"The pitch is not easy to bat on, ABD's innings was a masterclass. Can't expect everyone one else to do that.",9
Does anybody else love the excitement of AB behind the wickets?,8
I started watching a lot of black interracial p0rn after Russel destroyed England in WC. That's how much I love this big black man.,10
Field placement has been top notch by Kohli!!,2

Doubt he might score more than double digits.",10

Kkr really don't trust Tripathi or somethi,2
RCB needs to bowl Siraj for KKR to make a comeback,2
Is this some alternate timeline where RCB is this good?,4

It’s 2 new batsmen at the crease and the rrr is almost 15 with 9 overs left. The match is effectively done,4

RCB bowling consistently well- Wait that's illegal,8
Oh yeah. Captain Morgan continuing with his fabulous IPL record,2

Nice to see the English representatives have a stellar couple days in the ipl :/,2

Maybe we need to apologize to VK for that innings. ABD was in some other form today,6

Russell is so out of form though q",0
That'll do for the NRR,1

RCB should not play at chinnaswamy.,7

RCB using Sundar properly has made all difference in bowling this season,6
I want to apologize to DK. I thought he would defy his career trend and actually be consistent batsman.,2
That ass grab by chahal though.,6
I have a question on hawkeye for lbw. Is it calibrated for different pitches or takes average bounce across all pitches. I ask this because there was no way Chahal's delivery to Morgan(LBW review) would have bounced that much.,1
"With the way KKR are collapsing, I am looking at ABD's batting under whole new light. Guy murdered KKR's bowling",7

RCB are perfectly set up for a humiliating defeat right now.,0

Just can't imagine the NRR boost to RCB after this match.,1
"Fair to say, RCB read the pitch better than KKR

Spin is the way to go on this

Virtually impossible to get away",6
As an RCB fan it's just nice to see a team constructed with balance in mind. Don't think we'll win but at least it looks like some brains are being used this year.,10
Udana is being kept for bowling at the death?,6
KKR do have such depth in their batting order.,3
Damn 😍 I will let russel do anything to me 😏,-4

Edit: Ha, Udana hasn't bowled yet! Nvm",1

Kohli looks like he'll give Udana Indian citizenship and join him in the Indian team,16

Dk and Rahul look similar with that helm and stance🧐🧐🧐,2
ABD was absolute god if batsmen are having this much trouble today,10
"Shubman Gill is, a very consistent player. I strongly believe he doesnt get the support from the other batsman. Therefore, no quality partnership..... And wickets.",3
AB please come back out of retirement,4
One big over can bring them back in to this game!,1
Russell is not the best at shot selection. 9 overs of batting might be too much for him,3
Am I cunt for wanting dre Russ to smoke rcb.,5
U...uu....uuu....uuusss...uuussssuuru,2
Everytime Russel smashes a six I touch my nipples 😍,2
Both Lord Tewatia and Washi have given 20 off their 4 overs in Sharjah,5
Get Russell and profit,2
Bring saini and clean up dre russ.,3
Does Indians spend a lot on mutual funds? Because every fuckin second ad is Mutual funds.,5

"Ngl with each passing RCB match I watch, I grow gradually more and more convinced that I am actually the one causing them to win by watching.

The only match of theirs I haven't watched at all was the KXIP match (which they lost) and then for the DC match I couldn't watch the whole time, kept dipping in and out, and they lost that one too",9
If KKR lose this match then they will have lost every game against opponents above them and win against every team below them.,10
Would not be surprised if KKR wins from here. Another Rahul at crease.,2
3 from Morris 4 from Udana and 1 from Chahal they don't need Siraj and Saini.,2
Sometimes it really do be like that.,1

Morris against Russell is actually brilliant still remember how in the previous season the fielder was just placed near a very specific spot the previous ball and Russell got caught exactly there,6

How many catches have we dropped. SMH.,5
Great effort kid,5
That was travelling,1
Hard catch but should've caught that.,7
Man not to Russell,9
Sundar has low-key been the difference between RCB's makeover from a meme team to genuine contenders.,25
Both long on and long off dropping catches,3
Noooooooooo,5
I fuckin can't,0
Has Russel had any gane winning innings this season?,1
14 drops by RCB,4
How is our catching so worst,6
Fucking dropped catches,2

Badly missing AB in the feild. Play Philip next time pls,3

Narine woulda changed this game so much both with the bat and ball,0

Siraj still going at 10 per over when everyone else is bowling well under 6. Representing Dinda Academy by heart always.,-3

You guys actually think you might see anything other than a RCB win? This ain't kxip lmao,15
2 runs?,2
Maybe a change in fielding coach? this is just bad,4
Is it just me or do others find KP annoying ?,4
What an over from Morris,10
RCB's fielding has been dogshit for the last 4 seasons now.Can't blame the bowlers much if the fielders don't catch the ball,13
Who are RCB's fielding coaches. Akmal brothers?,11
Unless russel smacks then we know abd was just playing like a god.,16
Player who has done jackshit in IPL over the years should be made captain over an Indian veteran. - Armchair experts on this sub,0
Morris is bowling like an absolute dream so far. Nailing the yorkers and all his variations. Really impressive getting into the thick of it so soon having not have played any cricket for such a long time.,23
CSK and KKR making Morris look world class,6
what do you do at this point? try to play slow to end with a better nrr?,3
When is it too much even for Russell?,4
Bowldeep > batdeep at Sharjah,10
KKR has the same problem as CSK. They start off playing test cricket thinking they can take the rrr to over 15 and still win the game. These guys are delusional as fuck. Russell this year is very different than Russell last year.,15
"That Finch innings doesn’t look half as slow now, does it? Impatient fucks.",29
"120 runs in 7 overs is a lot,even for Russel, who is out of form as well.",7
"Dk captaincy and batting is highly inconsistent   
He has good and bad days in rotation",5
Hope for best from RCB in death overs,3
India could've had Hesson as coach but we are probably now stuck with Shastri until the 2023 WC,5
"Omg, RCB is gonna come out of the NRR shithole for sure",2
Did Koach forget about Udana?,12
"This feels weird, something's not right. As an RCB fan, I'm expecting Russel to eat the Wakanda's Black Panther Magic Herb in the strategic timeout and come back to destroy us.",2
They should’ve just opened with tripathi,3

Idiot DDP catch drop earlier,-6
woah..DDP..wow..insane effort,5
"OMG HOLY SHIT!!!!!!  

Well, RIP. :(",4
"Lol Morris looking like a great bowler now, big improvement from when he was at Delhi. Sundar, Chahal, Morris, Saini is a very respectable attack. Just Dube/Siraj that have the potential to leak massive runs on their off days.",1
Great fielding!!,3
Great effort,2
What an effort.,1
"God level save by DDP

Why not Steyn instead of Udana? I don't see how he is the death overs specialist.,0
Great effort.,8
Go for the yorker Isuru,3
What an effort.Hold your head high my guy,5
Swann really hates the 3rd umpires with a passion,3
Please not again,1
Classic RCB,1
Swanny v Third Umpire is the greatest rivalry this year,3
"RCB bringing Russel into form.

yepic",1
Udana giving kkr a fair chance.,1
"If the commentators can stop jinxing the fuck out of this, it would be nice.",2
Rcb being rcb,2

Fuck you PTSD,5
Now RCB has unleashed Russel's wrath,1
No pls,2
"Third umpire: *exists

Dugout: I'm going to end this man's whole career",4
IPL has a different feel this year with it being in UAE and no crowds but mainly RCB not being butt of jokes,2
"Fuck yeah, Go Russel!",3
So much PTSD!,2
Too little too late,3
Is this regular of rcb to bowl udana so late?,5
DDP should have double jumped. Noob mistake.,3
RUSSEL MAINIAAAA,2
Yes udana keep bowling full tosses it'll work out definitely,4
"There must always be atleast one meme bowler on RCB

Dems the rule",2
Not really smart by introducing udana so late.... He need to get in form a little by bowling a few overs,6
Has it begun?,5
"RCB: 

*Chuckles*

*I am in danger*",8

I usually love a close contest but not today please,3
"Is Russell gonna do it? Would have to be a superhuman effort to go at 17 rpo for 7 overs

Edit: noiceee",1
"Gotta say that while the batting has been shit, the bowling has been fantastic.

Morris has been really good",3
We need more yorkers,2
That dropped catch is gonna hurt us,1
The horrors watching this,2

Got to give some credit to the bowlers too. It’s super tough to bowl dots to russel .,4

Somehow RCB being good is the most shocking thing to happen in 2020,9
lmao why did Chahal just flinch,4
"Isn't it weird how we think MI and DC are running away at the top of the table, but either KKR or RCB will join them to have the same number of points",7
Fuck Yeah!,7
Symbolic. Siraj takes the catch. Russell walking back.,9

"Alright, show's over.",3
"Udana may be expensive, but he gets the wickets you need",13
Lovely comeback by Udana!,9
People who wanted RCB to get 200 and thought that was on par: 🤡,7
RCB are our best bros. Donated us our solitary win of the season and now taking revenge for us as well. I'll be rooting for you guys,15
"Redemption for siraj, finally",9
Why does after every wicket we have to see Kohli's annoying celebration,-2
Kohli runs more for a wicket celebration than I've run in the entire day,24
"And that's how you win matches.

Improve you net run rate too, RCB. Won't get another such chance.",10

As long as Tripathi does not pull a Lord Tewatia we should be fine,2
We will get a big boost to our NRR too. Hell yeah!,4

Wish it never stops! Lol",15
"In the last 3 years of me supporting RCB, I have not had this feeling.",22
Rcb bowling masterclasses feel like such a parallel universe experience after 11 years of consistent shit shows,21
RCB looking so good this IPL too. This is better than the 2016 season where Kohli had to carry them.,6
Cummins gonna shithouse a 40(15) to leave RCB's dream of NRR recovery a dream.,2
"But but Kohli batted slow. Lmao. This is King Kohli, not KL “Strike rate is overrated” Rahul. If he’s struggling that means the pitch is shit",14
Hey koach it's okay if you want to use some of my calories. I don't use them anyway.,12
Fun fact: RCB are gonna lift the IPL and there is nothing you can do about it.,6

Just had a thought: r/Cricket had RONS before the world had stonks,3
Even altroz looks beautiful today,3
Talking about Gil... THAT ALTROZ,6
Its the difference between russell and polly. Russell just tries to smack every ball and polly plays sensibly. Russell against was in a simmilar situation. He had got a six in the rabada over. But then again going for a biggy and gets out. Today was the similar occasion. 14 runs out of 3 balls and then going again. Just see pollard against us in the first match. Russell can give you a 20 ball 50 but cannot give a match winning knock like pollard.,10
Man I genuinely believed KKR looked good on paper this season. I have a strong feeling they are not gonna make top 4.,7
"Gill looks good, right guys?",4
Swann having an orgasm,6
Time to do a Rahul Tripathiyan!,2
ABD is god,14

I watched morris bowl in bbl last year. He was great. Good to see he is continuing the same.,8
Can't believe we have a bowler who can actually hit his Yorkers at the death.,9
"Hey KKR, 100 from last 6 is our strategy. Please dont steal. kthxbye",12
Dugout people really creaming on sight of the Altroz,7
In this ipl The only person who can win it from here will be tewatia,12
Are they gonna drop banton next match?,2
Last couple of matches twisted at 16-20overs,5
Just clean em up please.,6
Morris sala.,3
Damn! MORRIS GOOD,3
Tripathi taking the piss on management now by not even trying lol.,7
Turns out ABD is a different beast than these mere mortals,12
Now it's a perfect time for RCB to reduce their negative run rate.,9
Calling it. Cummin will do a Tewatia and Tripathi will do what he usually does.,-3

gIMME THAT NRR,8
KKR IS SHITE,7
RIP Runrate,3
RCB winning by a huge margin would help them get that Net Run Rate up. Boy the race for the top spot is on this year,5
Serves KKR right for not opening with Tripathi..,7
"One can say it was bad batting but I think it was amazing bowling as well. To be honest, I have hardly seen such crazy bowling. Both spinners just bossing the game is such a great sight to watch. 
And once again, ABD proving why he is the best!
Sundar I think has been the best bowler in the tournament right now. He has bowled against the best batsman. From Faf to Rohit to Watson to Morgan and what not. I'm probably forgetting some name. 
Commentators always rated Sundar very highly, now I can understand why they did it.",13
"Well this makes me happy 

Remainder that KKR belongs in the bottom half of the table and have shithoused their victories in the previous two matches",8
Even Lord Cummins is struggling!!,2
"ok, how well has Ab played on a pitch where literally every other batsman struggled.",12
RCB NRR _STONKSS💹_,7
NRR opportunity boys,5
What could go wrong if we weaken our already weak bowling line up ?,8
How have RCB ripped through this batting line up?,6
This loss of KKR will make a tough fight for qualifying now. RR and SRH got hopes. Hard for us as our next is with Mumbai Indians.,5
Is it safe to call this game now?,3
NRR bois Lets gooooo,7
Redemption for DP is quick again,4
hope rcb wins the tourney so the trophy curse for vk ends before the world cup.,5
NRR will go up hella high wtf,0
We getting nrr too let's fucking goo,3
RCB should aim to boost NRR,2
I'm not used to our bowling being like this.,6
Dafaq KKR. Don't need to hit out now. The game's already lost. Just make 7-8 rpo and save the NRR,2

"Come on, we need to reduce our NRR",2
"To all the people shitting on Finch and Padikkal saying they were playing slowly, screw you",2

Similar stature, similar ways of getting under a ball and playing width.

Last time RCB won by such a big margin was probably when Gayle was in his prime,3
Thank you 2020 for all your blessings. As an RCB fan I really needed that.,3
INTENT episode 200,2
"I want to say we are dogshit but this is a shit pitch that seems to be even worse than the first innings, and RCB is bowling really well (that felt weird to type out) so I won't hold it against the batsman. But this batting order shuffling shit needs to stop. Pick an order and fucking stick with it.",2
RCB are taking their revenge for 49-10,7
Is this what it feels like?,8
I hated Swann initially. Now he’s grown on me and I love him,5

How the fuck did this pitch go from a road to a fucking minefield in 2 games,23
"Tripathi, please stick around for the next 5 overs and salvage the NRR somehow.",10
Was it shitty batting or great bowling or both?,13
 RCB’s next test is chasing down totals,10
KKR will not make top 4,1
Kohli's innings looks good now huh? Rotated the strike allowing AB to play his game while holding the other end.,50

If kkr won this match there would be no change in the points table,3
"I've often complained of Kohli being tactically naive, but he's been spot on tonight, despite struggling with the bat. Good field placements, like the short catching cover to Morgan. Holding Sundar back, till the end of the powerplay.",7
I really hope rcb go a long way this season! This and the last match show that we have some solid performers for us,6
"Rahul do be doin a pro-gamer move, called *NET RUN RATE*",3

How many games does a team typically need to win to qualify for playoffs?,1
Now only Umesh can lose the match for RCB....,2
"If we improve our fielding and not miss those easy catches in the middle, we can maybe even finish in top 2. Also our lower middle order needs to be tested.",3
Chahal > Rashid,5

Rabada is so far ahead of everyone else.,4
Sharjah pitch changing from 1990s bowler's graveyard to 1980's bowlers delight.,1
Inflate Deflate strategy is a master stroke. The only reason we lost two matches was that we got confused and inflated the opposition and got deflated ourselves,3
KKR should bribe ABD and tell him to come bat. He anyways already has the helmet and pads on.,4
Bruh if sundar bowls like this for India then it'll be dope af,7

Which was the last chasing team to win in Sharjah?,5
Fuck yes chahal you beauty I love you,5
I do not remember the last time we have had games with this much of a complete performance like holy shit. 2020 is treating us well,9

2 more wickets for Chahal to gain 200 wickets,10
"Today all teams have completed half of their matches and by the looks of it, it most likely be MI, DC, RCB and SRH as top 4 in the end.

Seems like there has to be collapse one way or the other when RCB is playing.,8
Motherfuckers made me think it's out 😁,12
Having seen how KKR batted really puts AB's innings in perspective.,13
"Russell cannot clear Sharjah's boundary properly. Now understand, what kind of terrible form he is in.",5
"Can we change our home ground from Chinnaswamy to any other ground please :)

I am realising how hard is life of our bowlers who have to play half of the games there...",14
"Kp: that's a catch. Maybe in Australia, mate",6
/r/cricket armchair experts : b..bu..but but kOhLi PlAyeD bAdLy DAE XDDDDDD,15
Rcb go to bottom of fair play table,5
KP really hates DK,7
sharjah pitch curator halfway thorugh the tournament : **NOW WHAT I AM GONNA DO IS A PRO GAMER MOVE.**,32
Not even Lord Siraj can save KKR now,15
massive letdown for swanny,8
I'm on edge. This is a nail biter!,12
Good thing giving Siraj some match practice here and preserving intl bowlers,5
"As an RCB fan, expecting Siraj to prove why he's a proud member of Dinda Academy",1
"This is the sorta turning pitches sharjah deserves.

Unreal figures by chahal here.",5
Revenge for 49 all out?,7
Sharjah is the best redemption arc I have ever seen in ages,9
Lol even SIRAJ has an economy lesser than 10,7
Even freaking Siraj is looking like McGrath! Pathetic.,15
RCB gone from meme team to dream team,15
Ok so are we forgiving Kohli now,9
[Stokes praising Chahal](https://twitter.com/benstokes38/status/1315704384202956802?s=19),4
If sundar can improve his batting then India can play him at #7/#8 in LOI. He will provide a lot of balance to Indian odi/t20 side,6
Maybe rcb can now bring in umesh to improve his economy,2
Even Siraj gets to salvage his economy tonight.,5
"*RRR 25*

Siraj who usually gives only 20 in an over: Yass!!",19
"I reckon in small grounds like this, It's best to have slow/tricky pitches just to level the playing field between bat and ball

210 or whatever it is should never be a par score in a T20; scoring 200+ should always be a reflection of a great effort from the batting side",12
Appreciate the shot boys!,1
Village commentators are better.,7
We forgot that Tripathi can actually bat,5
"ok i'm the unlucky charm for RCB. I watched all the matches last year and only two this year

guess which ones

every other match i just check the match threads",6
"Brain dead KKR management lol

This guy won them the game opening, he gets demoted to number 7",13
Everyone's struggling to get their timing right never mind hitting the big ones. Makes you appreciate the enormity of what ABD did,7
Just Siraj things,3
Chad Koach fixing -1 NRR in one game vs Virgin Thala scared of -1 NRR,13
Tripathi deserves better tbh,9
Tripathi is mad he didn't get to open,13
Virat Kohli deserves this.,15
Give Tripathi his opening spot back you dildos,12
I love how the pitch has been. Small ground but friendly for bowler. Gotta take a big risk for higher rewards,11
Current objective : Survive,14
16(20). Lmao😂,9
"Ben Stokes on Twitter rn:

""In a batters game @yuzi_chahal should get MOM here,incredible figures especially as it’s in Sharjah 👏""

"I'm not watching, but has the ChinnaSharjah pitch worn out already?",10
He should give strike to nagarkoti man.,6
Rahul Tripathi with opening for KKR - KKR's 100% win record,6
Lmao you'd expect the teams to be reversed in this situation. RCB are really on a roll. ABD will probably get MOTM (fair enough) but Sundar's spell was what won the match imo. His economy was ridiculous and he got two incredibly important wickets. Such a gun utility player especially since he can bat too. RCB had better retain him next season.,42
KKR don't believe in NRR,20
Finally someone who can catch. Epic.,6
LORD SIRAJ,6
"What a catch, Morris!",8
"Where are the people who said RCB are 20-30 runs short because of Kohli and Finch?  Pitch was slow and it's slowing down. RCB should be glad ABD got the most of strike 

Don't judge the pitch by the way ABD batted. He carried a different energy today.",29
Its okay. One of those horrible days where nothing goes your way.,5

Morris is a delight.,6
"Morris : haha gandu, maar na.",8
Only issue for RCB would be the untested lower order. In the 5 matches they have won(including this one). 3 have ABD 50s and 2 have Kohli 50s. Tonight they got away with dropping Gurkeerat as well.,9
Even Siraj getting wickets here.,4
So yeah batdeep you were saying?,6
Siraj should’ve bowled against Russel just for the history,6
MORRRIIS BOIII,8
These saffas are dragons and unicorns 😍🤗,4
What a catch!!,3
That feeling when you hit a boundary and the required run rate increases.,26
That is Morris' wicket more than Siraj....,11
WTF? Everything RCB touch is turning into gold. This has been a 10/10 day for them.,10
"Imagine RCB didn’t lose that 1 game so miserably vs KXIP, they genuinely could have topped the table after this win",13
ABD innings was completely unnecessary. Overkill,8
"Kkr: ""nrr is overrated in t20s these days""",10
When it rains it pours. RCB has been excellent tonight,5
RCB finally having a decent year but there's no one in the crowd for Kohli to wave to :(,7
"Sabko bowling milegi!

Dube and Koach can roll their arm over,

even Finch can bowl whatever the fuck he bowls",9
49 all-out flashbacks,5
Siraj got a wicket... Wow... Bravo!!!,2
Chris Morris you beauty,6
"Um...so kkr's nrr might reduce, right?",2
RCB slowly turning into a match winning machine. You love to see it.,4
RCB go nrrrrrr,2
Friendship ended with intent. Commitment is my new best friend: Commentator,7
Imo Siraj is better than U.Yadav I feel sorry for him sometimes the amount of troll he have to face.,7
Morris has completely changed the look of RCB.,13
Didn't Morris ground this???,4
"Everyone wins in the RCB camp tonight, even Siraj.",7
*NRR.exe stopped functioning*,6
They were on the third fucking spot just because CSK and KXIP were shitty ..... Confirmed,3

Dafaq is wrong with KKR? They are doing pure injustice to Tripathi by not letting him open.,8
"Only just checking in on this.

Nice to see Morgan supporting his young opener by matching his score and balls faced so he doesn’t feel too bad.",7
IPL is shit when you can't mock RCB,5
"I HATE it when teams lose hope in indian talent for NO reason whatsoever. 

Talked to a cricketer who is playing in ipl rn, he basically said "" this is franchise cricket, everyone panics at every thing irrespective of when u win or lose""

Tripathi im sure couldve done better than Banton.  

Its disappointing",12
What is this RCB?? So fun to watch em,6
"Just need some Saini now, with his 145+ yorkers ripping the stumps off",5
Sadly Narine wasn’t there to chuck KKR towards victory today.,9
"Hoyy machas.

RCB aa????

Nah it's your mom . 

Shaata",8
Itni khushiii.......,10
All the bowlers from RCB have at least one wicket today,7
Swann deserves to be at the bottom lol,3
RCB dominating and CSK struggling 2020 is truly cursed,4
KKR screwed their NRR,4
Narine's bowling was covering a lot of the cracks in the KKR unit. Is he banned from bowling the rest of the tournament or did they keep him out as a precautionary measure?,3
NRR calculator running out of digits for RCB scorers.,7
Kohli hugging Morris is precious lol.,14
To r/cricket 3 hours ago: Fuck you,15
9d chess by KKR giving wickets to Siraj so Koach can keep playing him.,12
"This could go either way, not much between the two sides!",1
For fucks sake play 20 overs!,7
This was long time coming for KKR.,6
I’m so happy I’m crying,22
Kkr crosses 100...it's a moral victory.,13
"If you are watching on hotstar, switch to dugout commentary is more fun there",6
"McCullum is not yet a coach of highest level. sometimes his decisions may come off as brilliant, but more often then not he chops and changes too much. It may work in CPL but in IPL they'll get punished for mistakes.",6

Morris is a gun fielder.,7
Now it's batting practice for KKR tailenders.,8

"Sundar was always on India's T20 radar and now with such performaces, he'll be India's regular. Chahal already is India's first choice Spinner. And then we have Saini who will be India's 3rd fast bowler. 
Basically RCB has 3 bowlers from Indian senior team. Tell me if that isn't enticing.",19
"Chakravarthi averages infinity. RCB, careful there!",12
Remember rcb played only with 4 proper batsmen ttoday.,11
Swann has been shiite with his wicket alert after timeout. It shows.,5
Why no Narine this game?,2
SunnyG making fun of his own height,4

Can't wait to see a positive NRR for RCB mid-way through a season..its a rarity for us RCB fans,18

Why the fuck is that female commentator so annoying?,3
"They were abusing Gill, and he was the best batsman for KKR tonight!",9
"Reached 100, moral victory for kkr",5
All the bowlers have got a wicket what a sight.,14
Why aren't KKR playing Kuldeep Yadav??,6
Clean bowled next ball,6
"On a positive note, KKR have avoided the follow on.",14
Good faaluda😂👌🏽,5
Can Virat bowl the last over please.,16
Can we get positive net run rate,8
The last two wins were fluke after all.,12
"So many years later I still can't put my finger on why I like seeing KKR do this bad, but thanks for making my evening RCB.",11
AbD is a top notch wicket keeper!,18
Why does star sports change the commentary from dugout to the box randomly,9
It’s tough to comprehend how rcb winning without flaws,5
KKR kind of deserved this after stealing that undeserved victory against KXIP the other day from namma Karnataka bois..,11
Just bowl a toe crusher ffs.,5
Varun Rahane batting here,6
Laughing now at all the reactionary DK apology posts. I remember a comment which referred to him as a legend or something. Everyone's gonna pounce on him first chance they get,4
"Brilliant keeping by ABD, rest him for the remainer of the match and let Siraj keep wickets.",17
So Chinnaswamy is the sus,23
I still cannot believe we are bowling so well. Such a pleasant surprise.,19
Any stats guys know about rcb's nrr after this match?,15
Dont let them cross 120 pls,12
Where’s everyone who was saying RCB was 20 short of par?,12
Give kohli an over plzzzzz. Just for the memes.,26
Sunny G hyping up falooda is the best thing to happen this innings. Which is just disrespectful to KKR,4

"Offtopic guys. 

Is CSK playing SRH first time tomorrow or we've already lost to them once?
Seriously can't remember

Edit : thank you guys. So we'll be losing for the 2nd time tomorrow",15
Anybody else feel chasing is proving quite a big handicap in Sharjah? Only 1 chasing team has won and that was because Tewatia pulled a rabbit out of his hat. This is the second team to get swept away while chasing,22

Dhoni should retire,4
What's the lowest score this season?,4
Finch out and Phillipe in maybe? Gives abd break from keeping?,4
So udana was just in the team to bowl at Dre rus. Master stroke by superV,21
You almost never get conclusive evidence one way or the other for catches like that. Cheeky through the legs angle is a good one I guess,3
So many batsmen have been given out to catches exactly like this.,5
Kohli bowl the last over pls,10
"RCB till now

For 
937/119.1

Against 
1,042/120

Add todays score and subtract FOR - Against to calculate their NRR

Can't wait for this season to be over so that kkr can be finally done with DK,4
"So Kohli didn't play like shit, it's just abd being abd",79
Can someone tell me what happened to rcb this season XD? They're trashing quite a few teams,15
Finch's 'tuk tuk' innings was better than all of KKR's batsmen,68
9 out of 11 KKR batsmen have sub-100 strike rates. That too at Sharjah. Thumbs up for RCB attack.,25
We still couldn't get positive net run rate,15
So this is how it feels,26

"Guys, I dont recognize this feeling.. What is it?

Do the teams get to socialise only after the match? Post match the players of opposite sides are meeting like ex students meet in a reunion or alumni meet.,10
I think from now on till the end of the tournament everyone is going to choose batting after winning the toss,12
Another extreme performance by RCB... They're seriously looking dangerous than any team at the moment and with this momentum I believe they can thrash anyone.,26
"RCB are looking damn solid

DC, MI and RCB top 3 deservedly",25
"Why is Lara asking questions like why was morris not in the team, will rcb reach the top of the table after this win. Morris was injured, rcb lost very badly both the times. I think commentators should be up to date with their info after all its their job.",31
Only one player managed to time the ball properly on this difficult pitch but he's totally over the hill so.,20
Guys with kkr and kxip flairs saying nrr is still negative lol,28

Who's the girl in white cheering for RCB after the match? I've been noticing her for some time and she's always in white. Even my wife is curious now!,12
"Morris has always been a gun player in IPL barring some blips. It's surprising many seem shocked at him performing.

Gill trying to show his abs to the camera but sadly there are none,37
Haha kkr getting humiliated by rcb is just peak 2020,44
"So rcb now on par with dc and mi, so much for those two being well ahead of everyone else.",50
"In 7 matches, Sundar has economy less than 5.",58
"RCB now looks more of a bowling side. Morris/Saini/Sundar/Chahal/Udana. 
This is so funny considering they have two of best T20 players of all time.",93
"Damn no one really looked comfortable today, some pitch that

It was not kohli,finch,morgan and others being shit, it was really difficult to bat there guys

But abd is just abd, he's a mad man, a very mad mad man",60
"I think it's easier to improve the NRR if you are chasing and chase it before a few overs. Setting a total really dsnt boost your NRR,unless it's a very big margin. Is this true?",13
"""Tall, slim and very gifted"" - I don't want to know what might be in Mark Nicholas' attic.",20
"Cummins needs to be dropped to try Lockie, Tripathi should open, Rana needa to get into t20 mode instead odi and middle order of finisher need to step up",22
Kkr played 7 batsmen to get 112 runs,29
Just a reminder that kkr gave dk 3 seasons of captaincy,4
"Tbf KKR is the only team besides CSK to have so many players out of form 

Gill

Rana

Russell

DK

Cummins 

How can anyone believe they are gonna finish in the top 4 with such a state of their players",3
"Ahhh, still not positive!",23
A much needed NRR boost for the RCB team. Well played bois!,29
Just need CSK to show up tomorrow,5
Biggest problem for RCB remains. What happens on a day when both VK and ABD fail,23
"Lmao only 3 teams with positive NRR, that too SRH with +0.116",9
"How do you justify paying support staff/Captain who make these changes to your team  ? Haven't picked a single wicket in PP for the past 3 matches ,in 2 of them 1st 10 overs were wicketless.


You still go with a fuckall bowling lineup ,with 1 spinner and then chase like that.",10
Guess even narine is better than Rana this season. He showed some intent when he was sent at 4 in one of the games. Dafuq is that guy Rana doing,10
Only halfway through the tournament and these pitches have gotten so much slower. I foresee Lord Unadkat reigning supreme in the near future.,23
Wow. WTF? This is brutal,15
Imagine scoring 73(33) ..running twos between wickets (becoz kohli) and then go unto keep for 20 overs at the age of 36.,63
RCB Fans: join our celebration thread at r/RCB,10
"I fucking hate these ads, some are super quiet and others are too loud, it fuckin ruins it",8
Question is who can challenge mumbai ??,5
Boys climbed 4 places on nrr column!,20
Only thing untested is our middle order,24
"Still RCB's batting is over reliant on ABD and Kohli.
Maybe they drop Finch for Phillipe. He deserves a chance.",11
"AB ne Bacha liya Aaj... 
BTW... What was exact strategy of KKR today?",11
"Oh no, ""Ee saala cup namdhe"" Intensifies.

It's 2020, so anything can happen.",25
The most clinical win for us this season . Gg lads.,32
"I still feel kkr managed to get rcb under a chasable score ...But the batting order looked bizzare...

Also guys like rana , gill need to watch their strike rates , it's not about just looking pretty at the crease in t20


Tripathi if in xi needs to open.

Karthik if in xi needs to come lower down the order to finish games.


Kkr is a decent side which can perform much better Morgan compared to karthik.",19
I agree Gill is talented and blah but that guy appeals more like a One day player than T20 player tbh. Initially I thought the same about Koach and kanos but they proved me wrong and they've adapted/modified or whatever and that's what makes them special. He doesn't have to change his techniques to go for big shots and I wish there was someone to groom him.,23
"Abd is making the ball break the bio bubble.

Somebody fine him by not allowing to keep so he plays for a few more years.",43
Even if all the runs scored by ABDV were removed KKR would still lose,7
[deleted],-5
So KKR's Net Run Rate is currently -0.58. I expected it to cause a lot of damage. This can be recovered. Hope we do well in upcoming games.,16
"**Most Man of the Match awards in IPL**

AB De Villiers - ~~21~~ 22

Chris Gayle - 21

2020 is RCB's year ngl,14
"In between, this is first time that RCB defeated MI, CSK, KKR in their first match. Truely 2020 way.",47
Its really hard to lose batting first. Unless you are DC against MI.,7
"If kkr gonna play like this, its better to drop Rana and play Tripathi at no3, Morgan no4 , DK/Russell no5 (depends on situation). 



Also RCB request a trade for Lockie Ferguson from kkr.",21
Told you all we win one-sided,26
"Man RCB and DC are really good this time around, if either of the team still fails to win this year, then next year both of them along with Punjab should join forces to form a team called ""Royal Capitals XI"" and show what they are really capable of.",52
"**Stupid Stat**:

Pat Cummins has the Best Batting SR so far for KKR, striking at 174.

He also has a better Batting avg. than the so called senior Batsmen DK and Russell.",27
We need parthiv in the team to keep so AB can be fresh even during run chases...we are missing his batting in chases because of his keeping,20
Man siraj in the squad is still giving me a heart attack. I'd rather mann play so we would have less pressure when chasing,27
That match would have been a lot tighter with Naraine. No doubt.,17
Morris has taken 12+ wickets in every IPL season barring one(2018 where he only played 4 games).,24
KKR's loss doesn't hurt the most to be honest. Their lack of intent and a defeat by such a huge margin is so painful.,14
Tell me with a straight face how ab shouldn't be in the south African t20 team,27
"Gill is the only player who is performing properly , others are just inconsistent . Blaming him for losing is ridiculous . More so when your captain perform once a year.",21
I anticipated a comfortable win for RCB but not this dominating,28
KKR need to forget Pat Cummins price tag and try out Ali Khan. He's a better T20 bowler than Pat. No disrespect for Pat since he's a great ODI and test bowler.,17
Damn we took revenge for that infamous 49 all out by winning by exactly 82 runs. Very happy.,26
"Udana is underrated imo. He's a variation merchant, picks wickets, and is especially useful in two paced pitches. Russell's wicket was important, he could have got them much closer.",33
RCB should trade Phillipe for Gayle and encourage him to put all he has got one final time as the legendary trio of him/Abd/Kohli deserves to win IPL for RCB. I guess he will take it and produces few Gaylestorms in the remaining matches.,27
"Me before the reason : oh no hopefully RCB does better than last few seasons

Me now : Don't do that. Don't give me hope.",30
ABD rolled out a pitch seperately for himself and then batted on it.,46
"Y'all were cursing Kohli and Finch for 'tuk tuk' innings but they really weren't that bad. Our bowlers did a fine fine job though, credits to them.",22
From like - 1.355 to - 0.116. Gg RCB recovered well,21
Funny thing is KKR managed 112 playing an extra batsman while RCB played with like 4 batsman for 194,26
"Just for your kind information in 2014 kkr lost 5 out of their first 7 matches, with 4 consecutive loses.... We lost close matches like now kxip is doing and lost by big runs also... our openor gambhir and manish played tuktuk, but then utthappa came on top of the order and rest is history...

so before saying kkr is out of the tourney just think twice",0
