Scenes if Gayle comes out and annihilates RCB. But I don’t think they would even consider him for this game. Maybe for Sharjah.,3
Lets go boys....,7
This will be a good game to watch as a neutral.,10
:( Can't bring myself to watch dugout today.,42
Just want Maxwell to do well pls. Preferably in a chase with early wickets and he steers the team to a win with a match winning century.,5
Come on RCB do your shit!! Make us proud...wouldn't it be insane if rcb go undefeated the entire season and win it. It'll be fuckin insane!!,1
Absolutely heartbreaking watching Slats tear up,85
Who's gonna say Scotty?,9
"If Washington Sundar will not be used like in last game where he bowled only 1 over, RCB should pick Negi/Siraj as a proper bowling option",2
Team Bengaluru vs Bengaluru Boys,9
Royal Challengers from Bangalore are coming.,9
"Karnataka derby, lads, let's gooo",3
"Come on RCB, do it for Deano today.",7
I'm gonna miss the banter in the dugout. Damn I don't know how the fellow commentators will be able to cope and continue with today's duties. Still not over it.,77
KXIP Vs RCB. The unmoveable object Vs the unstoppable force.,5
[deleted],-5
I will never be able to watch Dugout as before,4
RIP Dino,3
Have they given a tribute to Deano yet?,3
Why is the match bot an RCB fan?,2
[removed],2
Can they stop calling Virat 'Super V' lmao,7
"Hi guys, hope y'all have a fantastic day. I'm not really new here, was participating occasionally a few years ago. Just wanted to know if this dream 11 fantasy team is good enough. Some of my colleagues are making fun of me for being a consistent loser, and I don't watch a lot of cricket. Any changes, modifications, suggestions accepted. Also if this breaks any sub rules, feel free to let me know respectfully.

N Pooran, KL Rahul (C), V Kohli, A Finch, M Agarwal, S Dube, W Sundar (VC), K Gowthan, Y Chahal, S Cottrell, M Shami.",4
"Fuck, mood completely ruined with the news of Deano's passing. I know many will say the best way to honour him right now would be to get on with the game and continue playing but something just feels so.. off with watching this match tonight.",9
Jimmy Neesham in,2
I wish Rob Key's first name was Don.,2
"Rcb will probably play philippe again today, then have parthel come in to replace him as keeper and have morris replace one of the Indian pacers, maybe umesh. If ab is keeping they may go moeen but don't think that's extremely likely.",5
[removed],97
"Glad to see a fellow Reddit is in the squad. But I’m confused, on whether to shit on him.",-1
KOACH vs The KOACH boys..,3
Fucking hell the Dugout intro for today hurts..,38
"RIP Dean Jones.

Scott Styris just broke into tears talking about him in the dugout.",81
Man it will be so hard for Styris today.,19
"Watching Scotty Styris break down was heartbreaking. Just hit home that we'll never see Prof Deano again. Sad, sad loss.",79
I am not in a state to watch today's match coz of this news. The voice that I heard yesterday  watching the match is no more. I just can't believe this!,9
I want kumble to celebrate if they win. Virat fans fuck with him too much. Kumble was and probably is the greatest indian spinner.,2
I can't imagine working in the same place so soon tbh. Scott seems broken. RIP Mr. Jones.,18
RCB and Kxip should make a pact to never to defeat each other by a large margin to atleast give each other a chance at 7th and 6th position,8
Dougout should have been off today as a sign of respect,11
Wait dean Jones is dead?? Holy shit I heard him on dugout yesterday. What happened to him? Not like he was extremely old.,3
our lord and saviour Jimmy Neesh is playing today lads,8
"Both teams are equally memeable, but RCB is stronger, cause they got chemistry between themselves. KXIP, on the other hand, is a team of good players, but they haven't played matches together (except Karnataka bois).",6
"Jimmy Neesham is playing.

Super-over confirmed.",64
Ship of Theseus. If KXIP actually the real RCB ?,3
Styris and Lee should have given off,8
The battle of the memes,3
Styris should have taken a break today. It's not right.,12
Fuck I was so pumped for Karnataka XI vs Bangalore XI but now with Deano's demise I dont feel so good.,12
Kohli won the toss woah,4
& also same 11 what's happening,3
Virat won the toss.....what just happened,5
Kohli winning the toss proves that 2020 is rigged,12
"RCB going with the same *winning* xi, noice",6
Rahul so nervous talking about Gayle,15
"""When's Gayle coming in?"" 

Awkwardddddd",14
Gowtham should have played. Wtf KXIP :/,5
Please tell me Gayle is in?,2
Neesham is playing so we're all supporting Punjab tonight right?,9
you can hear the pain in Slater’s speech,5
"Let's go, Karnataka Derby!",7
"AREEE YAAR UMESH YADAV KA KUCH KARO YAAR!!

T- WHY UMESH AGAIN!?!?!",-5
Gotta respect KXIP for not disrespecting Gayle and making him feel like a burden.,6
Idk why they are playing Nair. He's not a T20 fit. Mandeep deserves a permanent spot.,3
[deleted],6
"Really KP, is it strange that Jordan is not playing today, REALLYY??",6
KXIP does not even have one death bowler.,10
Man don't we have any other bowlers who can replace umesh? Ffs just add 50 runs and spare us the agony,2
We do too much chopping and changing with our squad. Look at MI and CSK - they stick with their players.,8
"I didn't even watch the dugout that often, but i feel so down after hearing the news. IDK how terrible the commentators and players who knew him are feeling today. RIP, Deano.",5
Kevin Pietersen is shocked that Chris Jordan is not playing! but the real shock to me is that Virat Kohli is playing!,4
Cmon lads win this and take us back to the top,3
[deleted],-7
Jordan has always been very shit. Its the england bias that made him so popular.,6
Have they mentioned anything about Deano or is it just going on as usual?,9
Listening to Dug Out will be hell of a weird today.,6
"I m seeing 4 weakness in RCB team right now Dube, sundar, umesh and steyn somehow they have to replace these with better player.",1
RCB vs Karnataka let's go bois!,5
"Gayle should play at Sharjah at least. Even his edges will go for sixes, lol",18
"The one fucking time a top order slot is available for Mandeep in IPL in the last 4 years, its taken by fucking Karun Nair of all people

wtf is this shit",14
"I don't see RCB winning tournament with Umesh, steyn and sundar  in their bowling line up",-4
"Kp being surpriised about kxip removing Jordan, the bias smh",7
"So RCB won the toss and decided to chase first, interesting.",1
Gavaskar and Pietersen look like Kevin Hart and The Rock,3
Our boy Jimmy is in !,3
[deleted],3
Do rcb have any batsmen that are a good replacement for philippe other then Parthiv when he most likely goes out for Morris?,1
[deleted],-3
"Hahaha, SG trolling KP",4
Kind of hilarious how differently KP and Gavaskar are sized and yet both are among the best batsmen of all time. Can’t think of another sport where two guys built this differently would be legends in the same role.,10
I wouldn't be mad if RCB wins this. They're a better team.,3
Dale Steyn a sight for sour eyes always,4
Think they should just broadcast the stadium commentary and give Dug Out team a rest today.,9
"RIP Deano, was from before my time but is such a shocking loss at an early age. I think Star should have scrapped the dugout today out of honour",6
KARNATAKA DERBY BOYS!!!,4
"After seeing cummins and archer,Yadav wil be ready to hit sixes",8
I dont understand why tf kxip not playing its best bowler Mujeeb,3
Man still cant get over Deano's passing.,2
I can't believe they're doing a special segment on the Kohli-Kumble saga but just brushed Deano aside.,0
"Unchanged 11 for RCB, this really could be the year

Only 2020",6
"Just tuned into star select, re run of yesterday's dugout with one of deano's classes. This is a terrible day.",4
"The question to ask is:

Which team will play more crappy",1
Have heard more Koach vs Coach in the discussions than any other thing,2
"mujeeb isnt ""rusty"" either, having played the CPL recently so he should have been a starter",4
Nair better prove himself in this game,3
"Well that Kumble-Kohi poem was awkward, shit and misplaced",5
Does RCB has any Karnataka players ?,3
RIP Dean,4
IPL vs KBC. It's going to be interesting.,3
Rip deano. Heard he was a legend from my dad. Fuck 2020,3
"Hoping that there is no umpiring mistake and whoever wins, wins it cleanly.",7
Atleast with kumble as coach i can rest well knowing there's a reason Mujeeb is not playing,2
Welcome to Karnataka XI Punjab vs Royal Challengers led by a Punjabi,2
Finch or Maxwell for D11? I am having trouble fitting them both,1
"I have caught a cold and was feeling dizzy, I mistakenly read Karun Nair as Karan Johar and was confused for two seconds.",-1
"Why r they playing Pooran again after a pair? 

For a hatrick of ducks",1
Guys any specific reason why Gayle isnt playing? Like am injury?,1
"why is sarfaraz batting so low?

he's s a good middle order batsman and KXIP have maxwell and pooran as big hitters so he shouldn't be playing below them",1
"Fuckingggggg get innnnn neeeeshammm. I brought you in my local ipl fantasy auction, don't fucking dare disappoint me with not tweeting after the match.",1
Aaron finch needs to score big time. I don't even remember the last time he scored a big one,1
Deano's jacket on the chair at Dugout as a Tribute,6
News channels discussing strategies and teams but can't even give a homage to Deano fuck media,0
"Scott and Lee look like they might cry anytime 

sad :(",4
God poor Scott is so heartbroken 🥺,8
Styris is crying :'(,7
Very hard to watch the dugout right now,7
Sotty is crying,7
"Man I could cry, this is so sad. Fuck",5
So heartbroken to see Scott Styris today.,9
Koach doesn't change the playing xi? Wtf 2020 never fails to surprise,4
"deano should have got a tribute at the very least 

BCCI and star sports are so selfish that they couldnt even give Lee a break",2
"RIP Dean, we will never forget you. Gone too soon.",3
They are playing pooran in place of gayle. They guy who made a maiden in super over in cpl and got a pair too in last match. Do you even want to win punjab?,5
Man they should have given Dugout a miss today. This is incredibly sad.,10
It's kinda cruel expecting Lee and styris to do the program today.,4
RIP Deano,11
Will miss Professor Deano's classes. He was a character in comm box.,9
Star don't give a fuck straight on face making it Koach vs kumble,5
Scotty is absolutely heartbroken,12
"I know that SRH has the worst middle order in this tournament but looking at the batsmen playing at 5-7 in both teams today, there are clear signs of weakness, especially with Maxwell’s poor form in the IPL. I think there’s just a general lack of lower-middle order hitters. Then Mumbai has 3 of them (Pollard, Pandya, Pandya). It almost seems unfair.",1
As if they'd bat Maxwell at 6.,2
"Kumble in exile has plotted this for years, he's even hired his Bangaloreans to evict his arch nemesis form this home city of Bengaluru.",10
Man Dugout should have been scrapped today,17
"You have to be absolutely STUPID to not play Gayle if you have him ESPECIALLY against a shit bowling side like RCB...🤦

If Gayle can chew an opposition then it's RCB",21
"Fucking hell, dug out is painful to watch. Give them a rest please. It will never be the same without Deano",18
"So who is winning

OG Coach vs OP Koach",2
Srinath and Kumble are making me nostalgic. 90s wasn't a good period for Indian cricket fans but man I miss 90s.,4
"In case you missed it:

Come on Punjab. Win this for Kumble paaji,2

Sad day today! We’ll always remember you for your love of cricket Deano. RIP prof.,4
Press F for Deano lads. Gonna miss him in the dugout!,9
May your soul Rest in peace DJ.,3
For some reason every Tn player except Ashwin(who got injured) sucked in this ipl hope atleast m ashwin  do something,2
Nice to see they managed to arrange black bands,3
"Aggrawal did a Mushfiqur Rahim the other day, did all the hard work  and then went for the glory",1
Hindi comms not even mentioning Dean,1
Lets see what rcb brings for the fans today,3
How many times is KP going to talk about every ball being an event,4
Rahul to get 2000 runs in his 69th match,6
Umesh Yadav is starting,4
"Only reason I'm watching this – Deano. He'd be watching from somewhere nicer, and higher up. Enjoy Deano x",7
"Ok so let me make this clear. 




We don't call anyone paaji in Punjab. And I don't know who told non Punjabis we do that? I blame Bollywood.",3
I still expect KL to absolutely tore it apart just like his pre IPL form before it was postponed,5
Guys has anyone mentioned yet that punjab have more bangalorians than Bangalore.,2
"Fucking hell Bret Lee is in the dugout, my heart goes out for him after what he went through.",6
"Wow, KL has played a nice amount of matches.",7
[removed],-2
Umesh is going to rock today.,0
on Kayo they haven't mentioned Deano once,7
Why isn’t steyn  opening the bowling???,1
Not even a moment's silence. He was on the commentary team ffs,10
Hoping umesh would get back his mojo and take a couple of wickets in the powerplay,1
Why they are wearing black band ?,3
I am surprised they don't start the countdown from 11 now,1
Why can’t RCB get rid of Umesh? At least don’t give him the 19th or the 20th over!,2

"Guys Guys everyone who was mistaken like me,

1. Pieterson, Slater, and Gavaskar spoke for 5 minutes about him pre match

2. Styris, Brett Lee, Swann and Bangar spoke about him for about 5-10 minutes before the match in the dugout. They're leaving a chair open in the dugout in his honour tonight",95
2000th run incoming,3
[deleted],2
I hope the commentators especially in the dugout were given a choice about appearing on air today. It’s a bit crazy to me that commentators on the regular comms are carrying on as normal with the same amount of enthusiasm. Hope they speak about Dean Jones at least. Would be a travesty otherwise.,2
Agarwal already with that 150 sr,5
There he is,3

In honour of Deano everyone should be required to walk down the wicket to the first ball they face from a fast bowler,6
"Can't bowl, can't field, can't bat.",-4
"Guys, the dugout commentary is on cos Lee et al wanted to come out and celebrate cricket- as that’s what Deano would have wanted. They are remembering all his great moments and celebrating what was a gifted life. Everyone deals with death in their own way and the dugout are doing their best to keep the spirit alive. So let’s just have a good game!",38

Is Shivam Dube gonna bowl at the death again?,1
Dale Steyn bowling slower than Pollard. ┬──┬ ノ( ゜-゜ノ),8
KL and Mayank playing traditional strokes mostly. Nice to see that they are not looking to slog their way early on atleast.,8
Seeing Steyn bowl slow is kinda weird.,2
When will there be the auction again in which the team can only retain 3 players?,2
Idk why someone would have that long hair in UAE when it’s so it and humid maybe he should have a good trim and then the stare and those eyes will be deadlier,6
100 kph ?,-1
100 kmph is it a joke. This is ultra slow ball,0
100.4 kmph lol,-1
"Just a reminder. RCB let go of both Rahul and Agarwal. RCB don't understand the importance of having solid 7 Indian players in the playing XI. 

Other teams have balanced talent. With RCB, it's 3-4 superstars, couple of decent players and rest 5-6 meh and make sure all the advantage is lost.",13
100kph lmao,0
Why are they trying slower balls at this stage?,0
mayank's test debut has done wonders for him. been so much more sensible in t20 as well,2
101 and 108 kmph lol,2
I remember Steyn hitting 145Kmph easily when I was still a kid. He has had such a long and good career.,6
Man i hate byjus,7
Mohit Sharma bowled a 75 kmph slower ball. Thats like a spinners slower ball.,5

Dale Steyn looking like Prime Gillespie 😂,5
"21 from Rahul and 20 from Mayank. Good to see both players performing and not building pressure on either of them. 

Plus, they are maintaining a pretty decent 8-8.5 run rate.",6
Dean Jones was a gentle soul.,11

2 overs from saini in the power play? 😔😔😔,0
If Steyn gonna bowl slower balls why we are even playing him,-9
Too early to show that innings 😭😭😭,2
What a take from josh Philippe,3
"Anyone remembers Deano dressed as a professor with a blackboard and chalk in pre-match shows? It used to be on NDTV probably, but very funny and amusing!",6
Woah Philippe! This Philippe I like.,6
"KL is going to be the Indian keeper next I think. Harsha Bhogle was right, as talented and brilliant Pant is, KL will most likely take on the role given he opens and is a good keeper, which will allow India to play that extra batsman or bowler.",5
[deleted],29
Great take from Philippe,8
Excellent by Philippe,6
Thats a great take from philipe,2
Phillipe saved 5,1
Brilliant take from Phillipe,5
No dream 11 points for this awesome take,2
"What an athletic take by Josh  
No one patted him on the back or anything lol",4
Philippe should get 4 points in fantasy for that,6
"Not going to lie, this RCB attack feels so good. You have three bowlers bowling 140+ and a leg spinner ripping leg breaks. Two of the sexiest bits of cricket.",-1
Punjab bowling looks weak even so against this strong batting line up. Anything under 200 will be very difficult to defend. I don't understand why did they sit out a pure bowler.,2
IPL teams should have different colors in their jerseys. Too many team kits look similar,3
I feel Kohli is bowling out Saini too quickly. He's too valuable at the death to bowl 2 overs in the powerplay.,0
A few BBL'S ago they had this thing where a celebrity would sit on a podium in the crowd and if the ball ever was caught by that celebrity a home viewer would win a cash prize. The podium was in exactly the same spot as that car and the ball pretty much never went anywhere near the celebrity. Have they done the maths and figured out the safest and least likely place for a 6 to go while still maintaining eyes on the sponsor's car? In the BBL's case they put them there so no one ever won the money,18
Flying Josh,7

Navadeepa channelling his inner Umesha,1
DAE enjoy Slats commenting? I find him intolerable.,3
"Used to play junior cricket with Philippe, we used to call him Josh Phalanges or Josh Fallopian Tube, was a fucking gun bat though",48
Saini and Steyn are channeling their inner Rajat Bhatia.,13
Should have stuck to pace but Mayank is moving around so the umpires have to take that into account b4 giving it as a boundary,4
Saini is trying too many things,3
C'mon Saini. That's rubbish.,2
Is it the pitch or Steyn looks like has lost his edge.,1
Ah these Deano memories :(,5
C’mon we need early wickets so we can make inroads into their middle order who haven’t had the best of starts,4
Kohli did not make any changes to squad? This is beyond science!. We have slipped into an alternate timeline,11

Oh man I cant watch dugout anymore,6
Where are you guys watching the montage? Im watching this in hotstar and i see nothing.,4
Shami looks like the uncle in the society who always plays cricket with the kids and never denies to give the ball back if it goes into his balcony. While playing he also ensures that the youngest kid gets a chance to bat,6
Prediction : Chahal will go for a lot of runs today.,0
Scotty in tears. Made me cry too.,22
Oh man styris,12
watching the dugout today. pretty sombre.,9
watching scotty cry is heartbreaking,15
Dad:why are you crying so damn loud,10
Ah man Scotty must feel terrible,10
*enough to make a grown man cry*,6
Styris unconsolable.,7

My favourite Philippe highlight in the BBL aside from him lofting Agar like 115m over cover was when he got a stumping from a fumble that went on to the stumps after rolling down his pad,10
Dugout today is the saddest thing you can watch ever.,11
Karnataka 1 vs Karnataka 2,5
I have no idea how the dugout folks are getting through this broadcast,3
"Kl looking in great touch today, we want 100. Nothing less.",1
Man the dugout is tough to watch right now. Can't believe how strong Scotty is being right now,9
Swann is almost crying T.T,10
What's happening in dug out commentary?,3
Kl is probably the best sweeper in the current indian odi setup,3
I don't feel like shit posting today man feeling really sad,8
Oh boy! RCB bowling is back. We need wickets. Damn it.,8
God their sniffles :( heartbreaking,4
I miss [young  Steyn.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaNAfutbTe4),3
Really? These mofos go to the third umpire for this but have to give the short run. Yes I am still salty,17
I know umpires want to be safe but going to the third umpire for appeals like that is a pisstake,6
Yuzi done it,8
What the,4
Fuckkk,3
Get fucked!,2
Fuck yeah dm boi,4
Chahal you beauty,8
Booo not mayank,3

Spank me Yuzi (｡･ω･｡)ﾉ♡,11
Oh no,3
yessss,4
Chahal you beauty. Let's go.,7
What a ball!,4
Beauty,6

"Well bowled from Chahal

He's at his best when he's tossing it up and beating the batsmen just like that 

Seen him bowl flat too often for my liking though",4
omg chahal's finger flew off when he high fives kohli,9
TikTok and PugG banned. Chahal finally focussing on his bowling. Thank you Modiji 😂😂,9
What is it with Indian batsmen not reading Googlies.,4
"There's a stark contrast to Navdeep Saini's wicket-taking abilities in the powerplay and death overs. 

**Bowling strike-rate**

MA Agarwal  b Chahal 26 (20b 4x4 0x6) SR: 130.00",3
looks like they not watching hand and missing googlies.,5
Koach wants to make mad love to Chahal.,11
Chahal is RCBs only saving grace. He performance makes such a lot of difference for RCB,10
How Scotty can even speak coherently is a wonder. He and Deano had that Tom and Jerry relationship where both would bag each other but you could see the bond they shared.,66
What a bowler Chahal is.,10
Finally felt like watching cricket with that wicket,2
Try not to cry challenge In dug out today,6
I’ll forgive him for his cringe TikTok videos just for this ball.,12
weird that indian players are struggling with chahal's googlies.,6
Kohli would probably kill anyone to get another bowler like chahal,10
Nicholas “pair” Pooran,5
"He didn't read it, did Mayank. Wtf.",0
After how many match they start giving caps to highest wicket taker or run scorer,2
"Send in Maxwell Kumble, he'll give Kohli a bigger headache than your passive aggressive quotes",4
Chahal is as good as Warne.,3
"Rooting for King XI, but I like Chahal he always seems so positive. Sigh",2
Scotty is on the verge of a breakdown. Hats off to these guys on duggout commentary team. It takes a lot to be on air after such a news. True professionals.,8
"Chahal is as good in sliding between the bat-pad gap, as he is in sliding into DMs iykwim.",7
He absolutely didn't see that wrong one coming. Chahal keeps on impressing. I think the most trustworthy indian bowlers in IPL are Chahal and Bumrah.,3
If I see Kuldeep play over chahal one more dam time in ODIs I’m gonna puke,6
"star should cancel dugout for a couple of days atleast, clearly everyone involved with dugout is hurting",10
"Just tuned in and learned about Deano. Yesterday I made a comment when he confused Russell and Pollard. Feeling like kicking myself right now. Be nice to others guys, don't be like me.",4
"I always support Umesh due to him being one of the few international cricketers from my city, Nagpur. Sad to see him being a meme in LO cricket though :(",8
It's great that Chahal is still so good. Kuldeep on the other hand is just ineffective,1

Why is RCB cursed like this!,7
Oh my,4
What a ball.,4
"Awful fielding

Should never have been 4",5

WTF umesh kick him out of the squad send him home,8

It's hard to believe Umesh is international bowler. First ball wide outside leg stump and second ball way outside off stump. This guy struggles with line way more than anyone else.,4
Unpopular opinion : Today's match should have been called off . I'll remember Dean as the voice of IPL .,-7
Oh boy that looked like the ball was dipped in oil or something,4

Hahahahha. Aaaahahaha. RCB gonna RCB.,3
~~Dinda~~ Umesh academy,9
Fuck you Umesh,1
Is it mandatory to ball a half volley in free hit? Or is it just Umesh's thing,5
wow umesh wow,2
I hate to say this but Siraj is better than umesh.,0
Umesh is truly the master of his domain.,6
"Hesson: *tries to give one interview without stress ball in his hands*

Umesh: Notice me daddy, I'm being a bad boy.",8
Umesh has been pretty shite,1
"What a cracker of a shot

Orgasmic rahul",2
Where's the siren sound for the free hit!,5
"Get siraj in for next match, cant be any worse than umesh at this point",1
Why wait for free hit when you can hit like that,5
Bahahahaahahah,0
"Run Rate jumped from 8 to 9 in one ball, Classic Umesh",7
Um^( e) ^^s  ^^^h,0
Umesh Umesh buddy.,0
"He bowls to the left, he bowls to the right. That Umesh Yadav, his bowling's shite.",2
In next few matches Siraj is going to make Umesha look better.,2
Classic Umesh going for 9 off of one ball,5
Yadavji can fck up in the ways nobody else can,2
Why isn't Gayle playing?,1
"Why doesn't the stream go back, I wanted to see that ball again",2
"get urself retired dude, the fuck is this bowler!",0
Lord Umesh has started his work 🙏,1
Is it a road or are we just terrible,2
"Everyone: Absolutely devastated
Umesh: Can I offer you some pies in these trying times?",7
"Poor Mike was supposed to interview for an over, thanks to Ummi, this interview is never going to end.",4
I hope Umesh has never won an IPL championship,0
Umesh Yadav is a liability,-1
I am watching the dugout today how is the atmosphere in the normal commentary box regarding deano?,1
Petition to rename dinda achedemy to memesh achedemy?,7
"Bruh I swear not even a year ago y'all praising Umesh for excellent test performances. Take it easy, this ain't his format",2
Umesh Yadav is the kind of guy who will game on the laptop with only the keys and mousepad.,5
"Is Siraj really worse than Umesh? I remember this one match against SRH a few years ago, Siraj controlled them very well during one of the death overs.",2
"Shoulder height legside full toss and a stop with the foot on the boundary, village never dies",1
"I haven't seen dugout before , is it better than Starsports 1 commentry ? Thinking of getting it.",2
[deleted],16
enough with the interview😡,-2
Ball of the Century by Lord Umesh,6
Umeshpreet Singh,2
Lol how do you actually want Umesh in your team. A Big Fat L for RCB lmao,7
Umesh gonna umesh,6
"Lmao, Umesh gotta Umesh",8
"Bro, he can't get one ball in line?",3
I can't believe rcb allows umesh to bowl after all these years.,10
"Actually starting to feel sorry for Umesh Yadav. Supremely fit athlete, great action, he has a v good outswinger, good speed.

Control is terrible though....",11
Pitch looks good for batting.,1
And the camera goes to koach,2
Fun fact: Umesh has the most number of “Player of the Match” awards for a fast bowler in IPL.,11
Why is Umesh playing?,0
Again leg side better to give over to Dube,3
Umesh straight up trying to Injure KL wtf,3
Wtf kind of a bowling is that Umesh ?,2
Umesh Yadav. Either so good or the completely shite. Proper RCB player !!,6
Oh Umesh,4
"I just got to know Deano is no more


Now I get all the comments about dugout now.. very sad news. Truly miss his Tom and Jerry relationship with Scott :(.",2
Proud Dinda : Thats my boy,5
If KL Rahul stays then KXIP can easily reach 190,1
where's the learn bowling from umesh unacademy?,4
Umesh and shit. Name a better combination.,1
Everyone too emotional during that RCB coach interview to notice the absolute garbage ball Umesh just delivered down the leg side.,15
This is a baby over,2
`WHY. IS. HE. SO. BAD?`,10
He will only give one over to Sundar but will bowl Umesh's full quota everytime,12
Wtf happened to umesh. Wasnt he good last ipl?,4
umesh yadav somehow descending to new depths...,6
Umesh just keeps finding ways to leak runs. Rather take a punt on someone like Siraj instead.,4
"Dread it,run from it,Lord Umesh still arrives all the same.",13
Koach is gonna murder Yadav,3
Umesh's depth and line perception is akin to a toddler,2
"For sure, Umesh has kohli's nudes",13
"RCB vs KXIP?

More like Chahal vs Umesh",15
"Yuck man. Umesh, the fuck are you bowling?

It's now the Umesh academy. Dinda was a legend compared to this",4
Umesh is getting a fully paid scholarship in Dinda University,11
"Nice wide, twat.",1
"What's the use of having Chahal bowl so well , only for umesh to come in? You need to maintain the pressure",7
Vibes of polly vs starc,1
"I once want an Umesh - Nikhil Naik faceoff, just to see who's more shitty",5
Who is worse? Siraj or Umesh?,2
I know umesh is struggling with his line and length but oh my god what was that,2
"In every match, before the opposite team, we have to survive Lord Umesh first",4
Lord Umesh wants his 50 this time,3
Fuck that wasnt a wide. Shit umpires,1
Signalling the bookie xD,7
Dinda is proud of Umesh,1
They spoke about Siraj and now rcb is getting hit lol,2
Ooo controversy is always welcomed,2
"A good day for both Umesh and Siraj is conceding about 40, and those days are few and far between",2
Why doesn't kohli talk to the bowler when something like this is happening,2
Someone out here down voting everything,5
"That was the signal, hmmmm",5
"Utha le re baba, Lord Umesh ko",5
"One good game, now it's back to the usual proceedings.",6
Umesh Yadav conceding runs like he's bowling in the death overs!,8
Umeeeeesssssssshhhhhhhhh 😡,5
Umesh yadav is one hopeless bowler,5
"Umesh shouldn't be bowling a no ball. I mean if you are going to get hit anyway, just try to bowl from like a feet inside the crease",2
"I've played cricket and I know that its not that hard to keep it on off stump, especially if you're an international cricketer training 3 hours a day",11
"Umesh has setup a new academy - Memesh school of academy.

Recruiting students now.",1
Is it possible to beat the record of the Indian umpires. Sheesh they never fail to disappoint,3
Sorry but hope umesh gets injured. I am a horrible person.,-1
90 off 10 overs by playing sensibly and losing only one wicket. I can get behind that.,7
The silver lining in the falling of Rahul the test player is that Rahul the T20 player is absolutely world class.,6
Let’s bowl Umesh and give confidence to the batsman who got out twice for zero in the same T20 match,5
"Fair enough they gave a second chance to Umesh but he's gotta be outta the side the next game irrespective of what happens in his final over. 


Just poor. Not even doing the basics right or bowling one side of the wicket.",8
KXIP will end up scoring 200 if RCB don't tighten things up in the next few overs.,3
RCB needs Morris asap ..,2
"Death, taxes and Umesh spraying in T20",2
Umesh not gonna get national spot again I guess,1
Rift in Dinda Academy. Umesh being better than Dinda gonna open his own Academy now.,1
UMESH YADAV! WHAT A BEAST!,1
[removed],4
Remember last year when Ummi bhai almost gave away 26 to Dhoni? Why the fuck is he anywhere NEAR a cricket field after that?,7
Can someone tell me why Washington isn't given more than 2 overs ever,4
Umesh Yadav has Kohli's nudes for sure,27
What's the par score here? 190?,1
Don't take risks against Chahal pls,1
"Chahal puts pressure. 
Umesh goes and gives 20 runs lol",7
It seems as if Umesh Yadav is not having any ambition or fire. It feels like he is being forced to play. Might as well give someone else the chance.,3
"Ball of the IPL,that",1
Umesh shifts the momentum from rcb to k11,2
I would play Zampa instead of Umesh,2
Offcourse they will just play out chahal now after that over of umesh!!! What the hell koach,1
Anyone has any contacts in RCB ? I can bowl 6 deliveries on off stump.,3
"For RCB, every match its Lord Umesh Vs Saini & Chahal",3
"Why aren't they bowling spin from both ends? Washy bowled well in that over, an md would've given away just 4 runs if not for the misfield",3
Kohli got paid to just sit in his balcony of his hotel room in Abu Dhabi and read a pre-written message for that ad,6
"Thanks to Umesh, KXIP can play out Chahal's over",2
Who does Kuldeep Yadav play for?,8
Not even a single risky shot yet they scored 90 in 10 overs. I'm impressed!!!!,7
Go on give Dube an over against KL.,2
Bhai kohli ab toh nikalde unesh ko plz,3
I wanna see that no ball again please,2
Petition to change Dinda Academy to Yadav Academy,3
Should’ve given his remaining 2 overs to Dube after the control he showed last game,2
"How much coaching does Umesh need to not be expensive every game? Geez, how does one manage to not improve with such talent?",3
"I wanna see KXIP win, solely for the fact that they also have a lion logo.",4
Fun fact : Finch is gonna fuck up Punjab today and there is nothing you can do about it.,6
"Raool's wicket is a must. If he stays, it's going to be  190-200 chase.",0
Any cricket player here explain to me how does that handkerchief hampers th batsman?,1
"Can Kohli please bowl Sundar more, thanks.",3
Why are they under using Sundar?,3
Washington Sundar needs to get out of RCB to further his career. He is playing under a captain who doesn't believe in him.,9
Some players aren't cut out for T20. Umesh is one of them.,8
Umesh more consistent than Kohli,2
"After taking inspiration of Lungi Ngidi's 27 runs in 2 balls, Umesh Yadav decided to concede 9 runs in 1 ball. What an alpha in this field ROYAL YADAV is !!",7
"Lord umesh 17 in first 2 overs

18 in next 6 balls

18 in next 3 balls

Aap chronology samajh lijiye",8
That bookie wanted Umesh bowl a beamer and that handkerchief drop is a signal that task is completed /s,8
Can we give teams 10 reviews and they can review anything they want. Thanks,1
If there was a battle about most runs given between unadkat umesh and dinda..umesh would pin them down beat them hands down,5
These cringy virtual fans need to fuck off my tv,10
"Hopefully Umesh never plays a ODI or T20i for India again.

He is gun bowler in Test though, especially in india",8
Poora should start hitting now. They still.have maxi and neesham.,2
every day Umesh wakes up and decides legside length deliveries and half volleys with the occasional full toss is the way to go in t20s.,6
[deleted],1
"Vijay Shankar sucks ass. Let's not take his dismissal as a yardstick for anything

Chahal is a new man this year though",10
"Lord Umess has been garnering tons of money by leaking out runs in this IPL coz even he's certain his career's coming to an end. 😌

-Anonymous Bookie",3
Don't get the concept of dancing like monkey when you get chance to be on TV.,7
KL scoring 40+ regularly will bring some normalcy to 2020,7
RCB didn't wint 1st 2 matches since 2014,4
It was a good delivery but I am kinda surprised a batsman of Mayank's callibre was not able to pick up the googly.,6
wow they had an attractive girl in the usual lineup for dorky fans,8
Pooran looks all set for his first test century,2
We have so many overseas bowlers. We have to pick 2 of them each game,2
Seems like RCB have invested in a lot of expensive coaches but leave everything to the Koach,2
All Chahal's hardwork wasted by Umesh,6
[deleted],2
Chahal is uNDeRRatED,3
"For ages people assume that RCB's failure is because of bad luck. No, it's just terrible bowling. After every single auction i look at the squad and wonder the same thing. ""Why is the bowling soo weak compared to the batting?"" Chahal has been a great find tho!",3
it would be funny if Umesh Yadav was one of the players Kohli & Kumble didn't see eye to eye,3
"Who opens for India in t20s because there might be a 3-way competition between Rohit, KL and Mayank right now.",3
Who are those butt hurt rcb fans down voting everything......what the fuck do you guys want omg,4
Punjab careful vs chahal,1
In b4 Maxwell comes and bottles it again,1
What do you guys think will be the final score?,1
Is there no other fast Indian bowler in rcb other than umesh and siraj ?,1
If there is one thing I've learned as an adult is that nobody can be that happy with their life as the people on Dream 11 screens.,11
I think Philippe is a decent player but he might need to make way for Parthiv just so this chutiya Umesh can be dropped for an international bowler.,10
"Rahul and Pooran playing sensibly, not giving their wicket away to Chahal and getting 5 runs in the over. Smart cricket.",4
Yuzi Chahal is an amazing leg swing bowler.,3
Maxwell should come in next. Punjab will waste his potential by giving him 15/20 balls,1
Play siraj,0
The respect given to Chahal is too much. He is a very good bowler but KXIP is playing him as if he is prime Murli.,-1
Apart from Yuzhi I can't think of smart Rcb scouting on Indian players. We had KL then released him,5
These assholes could've been a lil more classy and not shown these stupid celebrations atleast today.,2
Damn Preity lookin damn fuckin fine as always.,13
What's Bangar's intent count already?,0
Looks like Kohli has something for Umesh Yadav beyond Cricket,9
"Kannadigas confused , should we cheer for Rahul or br worried for RCB",10
Wait we have Jonty Rhodes as our fielding coach now? Wtf,7
That Dream 11 fan thing is so cringe,9
"Kl would tear a new hole for RCB if he goes bersek now, just have to play out chahal",4
I thought jonty Rhoades was with MI NO??,3
"I remember guys in school watching kxip matches for preity Zinta, wonder if they still do that",16
Bangar single handedly bringing down the quality of the dugout. He is not a dugout material,0
"**Umesh Yadav in middle overs in IPL since 2018 before today's game**

Balls 168

Runs 238

Wickets 7

Economy 8.35",7
Fun fact: RCB is gonna top the table today. And there is nothing you can do about it,16
[deleted],7
Bowl 1 or 2 overs with dube now.,3
"At this rate, is it worth just having 2 quicks (saini, steyn) and replacing umesh with an Indian batsman?",1
Do you think locals know IPL is happening in uae,1
Looking and Kumble and imagining how good it would have been if he stayed in RCB and built good Karnataka players,8
Are we sure that is Preity Zinta and not an assistant with her mask on,4
Sundar getting another over. What magic is going on lol,4
"Chahal I understand, y'all gotta hit Washington though",2
Can I get a crowd track chanting my name too?,3
Shivam Dube should come into the attack now,3
Pooran trying hard,3
Washington Chachunder bowling smart.,-1
Neesh on screen,1
Rahul is class.,4
FFS Umesh! Kohli might as well bowl himself.,5
Lol look at Gayle just chilling behind,4
Is lord neesham playing this year?,2
Is that Jonty Rhodes in punjab dugout?,2
"Lalo: Zinnntaaa. Preity Ziinnntaaa.

Better call saul fans will get it.",3
Time to change gears KL.,1
Pooran needs to tee off or fuck off.,1
"If it would not have been about ads, the better option was to just not let Umesh bowl his quota of 4 overs and give the opponents 48 runs for that and save a good amount of time.",2
I think Hotstar dugout is the best way to watch IPL. Less ads and better commentary. Hindi and English commentary are both lacking if you ask me.,3
If any player didn't get to play a single match will he still got paid?,1
How cute is preeti Zinta,3
4.2 crore for Umesh and only 3 for Saini,6
If not for the Steyn misfield Sundar would have conceded 8 in 2. He definitely deserves more respect from Kohli.,1
I think the way to go is dropping Steyn and Umesh for Udana and Morris (when he's fit). Bonus batting depth,1
Neesham looks fine,1
Saini? Who is going to bowl in the death?,8
Scoring seems to have slowed down. KXIP needs to bat aggressively from here on if they wanna score a big total.,5
"here's to Deano, he's true blue. he's a pisspot through and through. he's a bastard so they say. tried to go to heaven but he went the other way!",5
Great over by washy,5
Time to accelerate a little,6
Is this u/cricketmatchbot created by ESPN cricinfo,3
"If you have problem drifting down leg, then bowl around the wicket",1
Saini has caught Umesh virus.,2
Why would you choose yadavv over sunder at this point.,3
Who's going to bowl in death now. Dube?,2
KXIP is an alright team. They have only lost in a super over to IPL 2020 champions Delhi.,17
Hi Jimmy if you are still lurking on this match thread!,2
"With RCB batting , I hope ,180 is chasable",4
Washington must be really good if pooran wants to go hitting but can't,2
I think more than half of the Runs have come bcos of outside leg stump bowling,1
Saini bowls 5 good balls and 1 legside freebie every over,6
Why is everyone wearing yellow shoe?,2
Key over would be Chahals last over,3
Why is karun Nair in the team ??,2
RCB bowlers are brain dead.. they have given at least 5-6 fours by bowling way leg-side which is completely avoidable.,6
"If a wicket goes down now, they should send Maxi",1
Who's gonna bowl at the death.,2
Pooran 16 (16) with Maxwell and Neesham to follow. Gg,4
"They have 9 wickets, why are they not going after the bowling attack?",2
Lord Umesh leaking at 12 an over once again I see. He won the game for RCB with his lord like performance the other day. So therefore he will win it again for them today. He's a good luck charm.,3
Pooran needs to switch gears now. Can’t leave Maxwell sitting in the dugout after this start,1
RCB should make sure Saini's room is farthest from Umesh's,5
What is Pooran doing,1
I'll take 170 from here,3
"KKR bowlers except Mavi: Imma bowl it short every ball

RCB fast bowlers: Spraying it down the leg side is the best strategy!

Can't go for 6s if you're going for a 4 instead. Taps head meme.",9
Kohli is planning on bowling Dube at the death again isn't he? He's hoping for a miracle two games in a row.,3
Hope saini get a chance to go to Australia for tests.,4
One whole Umesh over left. Sigh!,5
"**Since 2018, Most 50+ Scores in IPL**

RCB are the favourites even if they have to chase 185-190 IMO. KXIP have Neesham as their 5th bowler.,3
Pooran needs to accelerate now,2
"Man...they need a better ""DJ""",4
Remember when KL was in SRH?,5
"Saini seems to be such a hard worker, whenever he  succeds it really feels good",4
Saini will be done with his 3rd now so who will bowl the death with Steyn?,1
Time for pooran to get a move on. There are maxwell and Neesham salvitating in the dugout,2
Why some players have black band on shirts? mourning or protest?,-1
Someone should get out so I can watch Maxi make 8 off 5,8
I always see Pooran slip and fall,3
I thought pooran was an aggressive batsman,3
Pooran is on a poor run so far.,1
Why TF u bowl saini now ?,-3

Holy shit did someone say towel drop?,4

Shit outing for Pooran,2
Wtf pooran,2
Common Pooran Channel your Inner West indian,3
Why are the comms laughing hysterically?,2
Maxiiii,1
So Dube is the designated death bowler!,3
Watching maxwell is terrible for the nerves.,2
RCB spent a fortune on Morris. He is a good death bowling option. Have to consider bringing him in for Phillipe. It seems to me that AB is absolutely refusing keeping though,5

Blessing in disguise that wicket Pooran was playing horribly.,3
Most Punjab fans are rejoicing this wicket,5
Dube - Yeah r/cricket talk na,9
pooran is terribly out of form.,3
Dube > Umesh confirmed,2
Pooran would have been better off hitting that 2 metres to either side of AB to avoid getting caught,2
Probably for the best for Punjab. Pooran wasn't connecting and time's running out.,2
"When did dube become the man with the golden arms?? 

Lol bangar",2
Pooran should just retire for getting out to Dube.,4
Not sure RCB should have taken that wicket...,9
Pooran just oozes class but always finds ways to get out prematurely. He performed last year once pressure was off his back.,2
Dube u effin beauty,1
ct AB b Dube,1
"Dube really isn't treated right in RCB.

I bet he one day will change team a will perform really well, and all RCB  fans will again ask , why didn't he perform well in RCB.

Oh this Laxmi Bomb ads is very annoying on Hotstar,2
need some big dick sixes from Maxwell tonight,1
Watching RCB’s video on YouTube after their last win was so depressing. Kohli doesn’t inspire at all and was acting like it was a fluke. He didn’t believe in his team at all. And then he proceeded to talk about his and AB’s bromance.,2
Shivam Dubai,5
"Ideally I'd like to see Udana, Parthiv, and Moeen in for Finch, Philippe, and Umesh next match.  

Of course, it could backfire, but it would at least try something early in the tourney rather than stick to this pie spray.",0

uh-oh. Seems like my stream is 30 secs or so behind the thread here.,6
Maxwell is batting with focus of someone deciding whether to jack off again after 4 grueling sessions,3
Is it just me or does Dube look exactly like a typical Star series actor?,18
That was a bad innings by Pooran with Maxwell waiting to bat next.,3
Why do they have a fridge with soft drinks beside the dugout? Even if its for sponsorship purposes its gives a bad look,2
People really be downvoting this thread tbh. Trying to achieve balance,5

Kumble is Koach’s daddy,2

KL playing responsibly by not letting the tail ender on strike,3
"That catch drop by Virat!  
BEN STOKES!!!!",3
What's IPL with out koach dropping a catch at the most important stage of the match.,3
That drop is gonna add another 15 runs to their total,4
Mr. Kohli will say ball was biased and they had no chance,5
Koach should get a mirror to glare at himself now,7
Koach dropping the catch so Dube can take Rahul's wicket. 69D chess.,7

"Kumble now doesn't care if they lose this match, he's a happy man",11
Nair why. Bring NEESHAM,3
if you’re abusing everyone for misfielding you should be taking your own catches dude,11
Chad kohli letting his friend get his century....,6
Has Kohli cost RCB the game?,2
Nice of KL to let 5 or so random people have a chance to bat with him while he carries an entire team,8
Kohli loves Rahul too much,10
"Since his bowlers did a good job, Kohli thought this was all a dream and dropped the catch",7
Hope this drop puts Kohli in angry mode while batting,6
Remember when Kohli dropped Miller and he played a blinder to block rcb's entry to the playoffs??,10

&#x200B;

for example, 140 runs, kings 11 had KL holing out in the deep to kohli, he drops him instead (and for good measure drops another sitter the very next over)  and now i am sure kings 11 hit 200. and rcb lose bad, (watch kohli throw away his wicket), and after that watch rcb collapse  instead of getting on a roll.",-4

KL goat,2
Typical RCB match this,2
Good guy Kohli blaming a part time bowler for getting hit for a six in the last over when he has just dropped two sitters. Respect,12
80 runs in 5 overs?! Shame. Yuzi should leave RCB for a better team,1

Last 2 over 49 runs,2
50 in last 2 overs?,2
Inb4 Finch 9(13),3
Moeen and Zampa should play ahead of Steyn and Philippe,3
"WOW, KL Rahul all class.",5
How much did KL scored after that first catch drop? Was it 50?,7
"49 runs in last 2 overs?

Classic RCB",5
RCB bowling back in form,5
49 in the last 2 overs. Typical Rcb bowling,6
49 in last 2 overs - Rrrrrrr Cccccc Bbbbbb,9
"Last 5 overs, 80/1 lol",9
Now let's see if RCB can chase the total down or not,4
"kohli is super pissed. Let us see how that translates while he is batting. Generally he channelizes his inner rage positively. 

Some of the shots played by KL were phenomenal. Dube bowled a good yorker that was hit for phenomenal 4.",9
132 at 191 SR but with only 7 sixes which came mostly at the death. This guy is one classy batsman,9
Now let see rcb's #INTENT today,5
Highest ever score by a captain in the IPL!,6
"**KL Rahul - 132 off 69 balls**


Highest score by captain in IPL

Highest score by Indian in IPL",6
"One of the best T20 hundreds in recent times. This guy is a treat to watch.

Kings XI Karnataka with a strong score,14
Ngl KXIP looking strong team this year with in form players.,4
"Last year, it was Russell. This year, it’s Rahul",3
"Wow, KL RAHUL!!! 132* at almost 200 S/R

Fucking amazing, Kohli cost RCB more than 50 runs.",13
What the in the hell lmao. I checked my phone and they were at  140 in the 16th over and then I walk in my house and turn the channel on and manage to catch the last over. WTF RAHUL,7
RCB is fucked,8
Kl rahul is master class t 20 player take a bow.,1
those catches were sitters tho.,3
Bairstow must be kicking himself for throwing his wicket against Chahal when he had easy pickings from other bowlers,3
Steyn did not work so let’s try Dube.,4
"Of all the stars, Chahal is the most important for the team",6
"First Samson, now KL. Holy fuck do India have some good T20 batsman.",7
[deleted],10
" 

i think as long as RCB have kohli, they will never win a thing. the guy is poison for RCB.

Drags the team down and i know he is a class player but for RCB other than some useless 100s here n there, he never delivers when the stakes are high or come crunch time and messes up with everybodys confidence.

for example, 140 runs, kings 11 had KL holing out in the deep to kohli, he drops him instead (and for good measure drops another sitter the very next over) and now i am sure kings 11 hit 200. and rcb lose bad, (watch kohli throw away his wicket), and after that watch rcb collapse instead of getting on a roll.",1
Highest score by an indian in IPL.,5
KL Rahul is greater than the sum of his parts.,2
Not really a great innings . All credit to Kohli,0
Maybe Rahul is the best T20 batsman right now,5
Even Chris Gayle was in shock at that innings,5
I love KL. Back on board destroying his test career because by gawd can this boy hit a white ball,4
"Thank fuck that Dube got smashed, had every under the illusion that he is the second coming of McGrath, only to prove its a fluke.",-1
"Kohli acknowledged that he was going with the same winning team at the toss. Mate, you need to know with that bowling, that was a fluke",5
KL was just so fucking elegant...,2
"Finch 160(60)

12 Extras. 


RCB are winning this.",5
Part timer in the 20th.  Tsk tsk,2

Can Siraj be given a chance? He seems to be working on his bowling a lot.,3
Highest score by an Indian in the IPL,5
Rahul was on 90(60) after the second drop and scored 42 runs in his last 9 balls!!,30
"Maybe rcb boot steyn out for Morris and keep Philippe after these performances, not sure anymore.",9
Didn't see this much coming,4
RCB WE KNOW,5
"I cannot believe Virat went with Dube to bowl that over, despite the fact that he got away with 2 decent ones before",9
"Only if Rahul was 2-3 years younger, we couldve got to see him as the opener of our team for some more time. With Rohit and Dhawan still going strong, I dont see that happening before 2023.",13
"KL Rahul: 90 off 60 at over 18.

Kayle Rahul: 132 off 69 after 20 overs.

42 in last 9. Wow. Take a bow! Don't play tests, just be a limited overs god.",41
Sundar underused again. Can't understand this.,11
Watch karnataka boys belting RCB bowlers. Torn as fuck,20
I think kl rahul prefers to bat first because he is fresh to bat and not tired after keeping then opening the batting.,20
"Moeen, Zampa, Parthiv, Siraj IN

Sundar, Steyn, Philipe, Umesh OUT

But Kohli will be like “we want to be consistent”

There is no time in IPL to give long ropes. You gotta move quickly",10

RCB won't check his head bcoz RCB=RBC=R/BHENCHODS so don't respect them. Hafeez will win. CSA injured Dale Steyn but their daddy Jesus Stainlocks is back. they can't threaten him with IPL contract to play badly bcoz he already scoring half century for opponents since first match.",22

KL has the bestest of friends. Last season the generous Pandya let him score a century and this season it's Kohli.,21
I am excited to see kohli bat after quite a while,6
"Koach gettig ready with his ""we conceeded 15-20 extra runs"" speech",11

Koach better make it up with a ton otherwise I'll cut my nuts off & wear them as earrings.,10
"Death Bowling, but your team actually dies",1
"So, KL & Babar are top T20 batsmen right now?",5
One man does not a bowling attack make. Sigh.,4
KL Rahul is on another level. Steyn is a shadow of his former self.,10

"Bloody lovely, KLR! Enjoy it, man, 'cause Sunday you are in for a world or hurt at the Sharjah with mighty ROYALS!",4
Looks like Kohli forgot to wash his hands after having biriyani for breakfast.,5

So Kohli comes to crease with a score of -42.,14
"How can someone with a world class batting prowess have a dumb cricketing brain? 

Fucking use Washington sundar in powerplays. Save saini for death overs. Is it so hard Koach??!! Bowling Dube at the death when you have so much options is tantamount to self harm.",27
"Third 200* chase in a row  
  
Let's see some intent™",7
"After all these years, constantly losing despite having a god tier batting line-up because of piss poor bowling, one would think RCB will try to strengthen their bowling attack. 


It must be so hard for RCB fans, remember when you had Gayle, ABD & Kohli and still lose after scoring 200 in the first innings?",4
"RCB could be so much better if they replaced Steyn, Yadav, Phillipe with Moeen, Morris, and Parthiv. That would make their bowling, batting, and keeping better. Sure Maybe you could persist with Steyn but Phillipe (wastes an international spot) and Yadav (has a worse t20 bowling record than practically every allrounder) have to go.",6
What is Washington Sundar’s role?,1
"I just hope Kohli gets the slander anyone else would've gotten, for those atrocious drops",11
Kohli motm,2
Blame lies on Kohli he never learns. Should always keep one over of Saini at the end. He also needs to utilize Sundar better.,3
Rahul made 42 of off his last 9 deliveries that he faced,8
"KL Rahul 132* (69)

I don't know much cricket but i think every KXIP batsman did their job well. Didn't waste any ball and tried to keep pressure from set batsman. What do you think ?,3
My prediction is that Murugan Ashwin is going to get fucking smashed today,3
RCBians must be feeling very nostalgic today. Happy for them.,14
"I think rahul was dropped on 83 the first time, he added almost 50 in the last three, that's phenomenal",5
Ipl turning from bowl first n chase 160 into bat first n score 200,6
Damn I'm always missing the most entertaining part of the match,2
Everything went to shit after Kohli dropped the catches. His shoulders dropped and the team lost all energy. What is the point of having all these international stars if they can’t pick up the energy when Kohli is out of it??,17
That innings was completed almost 30mins faster than the first innings last night...,5
KL scored 49(13) after the first drop.,15
"if Finch gets out early in the powerplay, no chance RCB chases this",6
Wow sundar bowled well,2
I was in shock how Dube gave only 10 runs in 2 overs then last over happened.,4
Calm down it's just RCB's intra squad practice match,14
David miller all over again,5
Sundar bowling just two overs when the pitch assists spin is criminal.,15

Not able to understand how hard it is to get 4 overs out of a guy who bowls from 1-15 overs decently and that too when all your other bowlers are going for runs. It's also not like Sundar is going for runs in the limited bowling he has done. Today he bowled 2 overs for 13 runs which ideally should have been only 9 since Steyn misfielded a pretty easy stop and gave away 4 runs. Why will you not complete his overs even in a decent attack, in RCB his overs should be treated like gold",11

Why isn't Kohli batting?,5
Batsmen are absolutely clueless.,3
2nd innings Shami,5
Virat doing the MSD from over 1,3
Dropping catches and then refusing to bat 3. At what point do we accept that Kohli is just a mediocre version of Zak Crawley,7
I think RCB deserve to lose this just to average out the shit luck srh had first game against them.,6
"I noticed this as Tewatia took the catch, but failed to skid -- the outfield is terrible! No wonder so many players are getting injured.",1
Shami and his seam position. Has already bowled kore beauties in 5 overs than some bowlers bowl in the entire IPL.,3
lmao kohli has given up already,5
Virat MSD Kohli,5
"I feel like Kohli does absolutely no research or critical thinking as captain

That’s why he was reliant on MS in ODIs",7
pls not another 49 all out pls 🤞🤞,4
KKR all over again. 😭,4
"Shami will kill RCB 

Prediction : The famous RCB collapse",5
"What if Kohli left RCB, will he become better captain?",3
Kohli scared of Shami,3
"Koach last season was hell bent on opening, now he is demoting himself to No 4, wtf?",6
"Kohli isn't batting at 3, because Phillippe is basically opening now which is the position he is comfortable at",3
Finchy plays with his leg more than the bat,1
Phillipe is a good player.. don't underestimate him.,2
"rcb meemed back to abyss, pack it up boys",3
Now the master will show how a chase is done. Watch and learn kkr and csk.,4
"You rank #3 in T20I rankings ffs, A-aron",7
Kohli: what if i use 100% of my brain,9
"If RCB bottle up tonight, this might be the alternate universe (or 2020 if you say) where RCB wins batting first and lose while chasing",7
Tell KL to summon Second innings Shami.,7
Class touch by dugout to leave Deanos spot empty.,6
40 all out pls,7
"I don’t understand how Kohli doesn’t come out to bat after creating this mess in the first place. 

You’re chasing 207, not 107.",9
So the world's best number 3 decides to NOT come at number 3 in a steep run chase🤦,9
KING SHAMI,3
is there a big difference in Kohli's average when chasing in T20,2
Shami you beaut,4
Shami to pick 2 in his first 2 overs,3
Why am I worried this match is going to be the 49 of this season,1
Virat doesn't want to bat with finch,7
Ooooye mujhe maro. Mujhe maaro.,10
GUYS THEY MIGHT BREAK THE 49 RECORD TODAY!!!,7
Will RCB defeat Rahul?,6
OUT YESS. Go on Punjab,-1
Where  are the trolls who said Dhoni was hiding??,-1
This is going exactly as well as you expected it to go.,3
How good is Shami!,5
What a shit show... 49 ao incoming.,4
And the Indian Ringo Starr says thats out!,2
"Rahul opens from the top and tons up big. Virat drops himself to 4, MS drops himself to 7. Hmmmmmmmmmm",11
LOL,2
Not 49/10 again pls i cant😭😭😭😭😭,7
Dumb dumb shot..,1
49 under danger,3
Guys i was not in the rhythm and wanted to give these youngsters a chance incoming from another Indian captain.,6
"is this the feared ""second innings shami""?",12
What kind of a farcical move is this by koach. Ffs,7
Another 49 incoming,7
We are screwed,7
Maybe koach wants to come at a easier batting positon,3
smiles in SRH,6
Parthiv Patel wishes fulfilled,9
God its painful to see RCB batting like headless chickens,2
Haha this is the rcb we know and love,5
Now what? Send umesh?,4
Meme CB,3
"**1.3** Mohammed Shami to Philippe, OUT, **given lbw and he won't review!** Trapped right in front of middle. **3-2**

JR Philippe lbw b Mohammed Shami 0 (3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00",3
The real RCB showed up today... Kohlapse,2
Mumbai’s largest victory of 146 I think in danger,1
wtf man.. why do we keep supporting this team,6
Lol lol,2
Guess I can go sleep early today,1
[still relevant](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/iyw2o9/-/g6fmuzv),1
Shami is fire,2
Too much pressure on the young man.,1
Shami definitely among Top 3 pacers this IPL,1
Well next time estimate me,2
New target : 50 runs,7
**49**,0
Honeslty King's XI has a lot of my favourite cricketers,2
Phlumb,1
I have no idea what to say,3
This is peak RCB,6
48 for the memes. Please?,3
Shami you madlad.,2
"Now what does vk go for

Intent or Nrr",4
RCB - *chuckles haha we're in danger for 49*,4
"RCB getting mauled, never gets old",3
[deleted],1
50 all out incoming,2
How's the Josh?,3
RCB is BACK!!!!!,11
"""We'll have a bowl, thanks""",4
"Disappointed by the last couple of games tbh, exciting at times but game's over halfway through basically... hoping for much closer tomorrow!",1
Pressure on Kohli,1
we thought rcb was chasing 49 but it seems they are aiming to beat 49,2
Koach is such a shitty captain,5
Shami has been unplayable this ipl,4
Thing with RCB is they never give up. I'll celebrate when all 10 are out,4
I'm hyped for Cottrell vs Koach,8
"As a RCB fan, this is the worst time of the year for me. Life is just painful.",10
Guess who's back!! The real RCB.,10
Phillipe to be the next victim of virat’s Random Team Generator,26
When will RCB realize not having a fix spot makes the player play badly? When? WHEN?,11
"KOHLI you can't hide in the field

KOHLI you can't hide in the dressing room

Come out",11
"Josh Phillipe, bargain basement Smith.",8
I said it last time and I'll say it again. Get philipe out and get moeen in please.,5
"Doubt Philippe’s getting a third game now, shame",13
My god Shami gonna be good in Aus. No doubt about that. Only if we can have Bumrah and Ishant repeat their 2018 performances. Man Phillippe was late even though he's grown up on Perth pitches,11
Lmao our bowling lineup is sneakily decent. Cottrel has always been reliable in the start,11
Last night Dhoni came in Kohli's dream,9
The universe is really making sure Kohli takes responsibility for his own actions.,11
Wondering if my biryani will come first or RCB collapse will come first,8
Cheat code Shami,10
This is the RCB /r/Cricket loves,10
Mfw AB comes in over Virat,2
"Kohli is an anchor, Finch is an anchor, so they probably decided sending Phillippe would be better so that he can berserk. Stop whining so much.",6
Somehow I have this feeling that KL should be most suitable skipper to work along with someone like Kumble as coach.,3
RCB's back boiz 😎,6
Lmao umpire memeing everyone with that slow finger raise,8
U guys wanted Koach?,7
Chris Morris for Steyn next match please.,4
"Typical Kohli, opening the innings.",10
48 please,1
They are gonna try and play tuk tuk now. Match is over,3
Koach in shambles,2
Wtf finch,2
"End result 

K l Rahul wins buy 20 runs",27
RCB is back baby! 😎😎,8
लोङे लग गए,7
😭,1
Just play out the new ball ffs,1
Kohli taking a leaf out of the MSD book and just shitting the bed in terms of bringing himself out...bottler.,1
"Who's this female commentator in the match today? I'm all for having female commentators, but only if they're good enough.


The only thing this one has done is call the score and say this guy is coming to the crease, this guy is gone. Lmao",5
Lol RCB dropped a Chris Gayle for .. Josh Phillipe,5
Do people rate Philippe? He has played so little.,2
Honestly how can you have such a shit bowling line up and somehow still bat Sundar and Dube at 6 and 7. They have somehow have no depth in bowling or batting at the same time.,4
The Tracking-Simulation baffles me -- how is that an Umpire's call?,2
[deleted],6
"Damn bout to be the third one sided IPL game in a row 

Win the toss and bat people",6
Shami is no longer second innings shami he is on the money shami from ball one shami.,5
"lol kohli hiding again. has he ever delivered for RCB when the chips are down? watch him get out cheap again.

&#x200B;

i mean they need 200+, why the eff wouldnt kohli come out instead of sending in youngsters to get out quick and heap a shite load of pressure.

&#x200B;

thats power play down the drain.

Honestly Kohli is the worst captain ever",4
look out turky RCB are going for the lowest T20 total record,1
"Damn that's a big total to chase. 

If only they had an explosive opening batsman who can score big centuries easily",9
Finch looks so so rusty,3
People hiding behind screens calling kohli a coward for hiding behind Philippe.,3
IPL has officially started for me,16
"49 is the score to beat, RCB",7
Oh yes I'll leave that,7
Choak,3
"chasing 207

4-2 after 2 overs

Finch: **leaves the ball**",11
Poor Philippe :(,3
Come on RCB. Show some guts and smash it..,5
Finch is so lame in IPL. Absolute dud,12
Dale Steyn had pictures of Shami on his wall while he was growing up.,26
"4 runs in 2 overs chasing 200+

Deja Vu",2
"Oh what emotion, King Kohli on the field, oh no its a rcb match so he is RCB Kohli, preparing for Kohlapse",6
"RCB loses when they win the toss

Opposite teams win when RCB loses the toss

Sed lyf",3
Getting 206 will make anyone look like a good captain honestly. But RCB are just shooting themselves in the foot with this retarded batting lineup. Why wouldn't you open with finch or coming 1 down Koach?,2
Shami Saini Bhuvi boom bowling together hmmmm,2
When Philippe hits puberty he’ll be an absolute gun,12
"Ab is the only hope

Kohli will never chase this down on his own",4
Is this like all the teams that won their first match gonna lose their second and those who lost their first win their second??,2
"2-1....4-2.... naturally, one expects 6-3 at the end of this one?",9
Did Finch fucking shoulder???,4
"They have gotten the 2  20 Lakh batsmen out, now it's 17 Lakh",3
Virat Kohli was letting Phillipe open (virtually) - the position he was most comfortable in. He opened in Big Bash.,7
Ravi Shastri is a cricket genius,4
"Just because you are chasing 200, it doesnt mean blindly slogging every ball out of the park",6
"Inb4 ""Kohli is sCaReD""",2
lol what happened to parthiv patel. Am sure he is a better batsman than Phillipe.,5
Koach quaking in his boots at the sight of Cottrell swinging it in!,1
Salute incoming,3
Kohli looking rusty as well as Finch,11
"i always feel bad for rcb fans , another year with the wooden spoon",16
At least cross 49. Please.,4
Are all KFCs closed in UAE? Finch definitely needs some Performance Enhancing Buckets.,7
"Last time I checked Kings were 130ish with 4 overs left, KL Rahul is such a gun player",7
Sanjay is so uncomfortable to listen to,3
"remember lads, chahal said ""we'll be able to chase this down""",2
"There is no passion! There is no vision,  aggression",3
"was watching the match from ball 1,just noticed the score


4 for 2 lol",5
Going at a solid RR of 1.7 when RRR is 10.4,3
Kohli might lose his family gems here,1
"Yeah just waste the powerplay in a 200 run chase, no big deal.",-1
Why no i n t e n t™?,2
Kohli's gonna drop phillipe and dev's ass next match as how he dropped that catches,5
"Good move from kohli to send Philippe in, but didn't work as unfortunately",2
Why did Philippe simply not score a 50 like he did against Steyn and Rabada a couple years ago. Can't believe he hasn't scored 150 in his first proper bat. Drop him smh,1
"I have a gut feeling, that Virat Kohli will be channelling his rage, frustration & anger and literally going to go beserk while batting. Remember, that Kohli is in his best form while chasing and when he is under pressure. Come on Virat, show them your beast form.",1
"The most infuriating thing for me as a kid growing up was seeing a star player do badly/get out etc and the broadcast cutting to break and then seeing a commercial of theirs

I just got a Kohli banner ad for pimple cream on hotstar. Bc score a hundred",4
Rcb playing football out here,3
"ABORT ABORT THE RCB STRATEGY!

LOAD THE CSK STRATEGY!

SAVE NRR!!",12
Remember when commentators used to criticise players ? Peperridge farm remembers,5
Kholis record is so fucking scary. More the pressure the better his game gets.,7
NRR is here boys,7
Sunny bhai is kill lmao,2
Hurts so fucking much,5
Hey hey CSK and KKR scored more than this in 2 overs.,1
i feel there's too hype on kohli's chasing ability,0
I like RCB YouTube videos better than actual matches,5
"> doesn’t feel right to be taking now. It’s a little too easy 

Fuck not again :(",5
RRR is above 11 now. Show some *intent* Koach! /s,2

We are masochist . Aren't we,7
"Y'know, Shami is just an all round great guy. I was in the shops the other day and this baby would not stop crying, poor fella was bawling his eyes out and his mum was at her wits end. Shami strolls over from the next aisle, calmly takes the baby from his mum, lifts up his shirt, and lets him have a little suckle. He calmed down immediately, and mum couldn't thank him enough",6
"Only KOhli to blamer for this, make it up for it!",4

OMFG!!!! Bahahahahahahahaha. This cannot be good for Kohli's mental balance.,4
"So, race to the bottom of the NRR now?",3
"As I predicted, Kohli came out and did something stupid",2
This comment section is just gonna become a 1000 times more interesting and fun,7
Im crying😂😂😂,4
"Hey RCB, missed you",3
Rcb is back,3

Is there an alternate universe where RCB is good?,3
"Virat knew if Virat was the fielder, he'd drop it",6

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAH,3
48 all out incoming,6
Meme team. Meme team. Meme team.,7
Kohli's gonna catch it up once he faces some balls. Remember what happened in Hyderabad,1
"“Excellent batting to come”

*Shows Shivam Dube*",14
Just tuned in what happened to padikal?,6
Sorry what the fuck,4
Peak RCB. The infamous collapse is back,5
2 catch drops & 1 run great,10
Meme Team!!!,4
lol cunt,5
I called it!,4
Loooool. RCB baby!,3
Damn this is fucking pathetic,5
And I’m supposed to believe kohli is better than KL...,8
"Kohli might be the captain of India, but I just cheered like a money when he got caught!!!",10
"Wow, what a mess",3
Wowzers wtf is going on,5
"Maybe Kohli needs to be perpetually angry to play well, he's too calm nowadays lmao",10
Some 18 yr old fielder > Kohli's fielding,8
"**2.4** Cottrell to Kohli, OUT, **taken at mid-on!** RCB falling apart! **4-3**

V Kohli c Ravi Bishnoi b Cottrell 1 (5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 20.00",9
I will worship AB if he gets us to atleast 130,9
how do these chases get sadder everyday,14
Atleast he had i n t e n t™.,9
Bhai maro mujhe maro 😑😑,11
Biggest F of all time?,10
RCB was a social experiment funded by the Russians to check if huge masses can suffer from Stockholm syndrome at once.,109
My testicles are in danger ..*chuckles*,7
"Who is the guy that took the catch , let him teach koach how to catch sitters.",10
49 all out,7
49 is going to be halved today,10
Fuck off. Honestly fuck off. Piss poor shit. I would rather RCB not retain Kohli and get some fresh blood next season.,6
Lowest score incoming,3
I'd bowl out both Cottrell and Shami for eight overs straight for the lol's,6
4-3...,2
I was told this was RCBs year,10
Lads it's RCB,7
what's the biggest ever margin of victory in ipl?,8
I love this bishnoi guy,7
Kohli kindly fuck off from rcb,3
"proper test match lads, that 200 was on some other pitch",10
"Everyone shitting on Steyn when Kohli dropped KL off his bowling. T20 is a game of fine margins, cannot afford to do that.",8
RAHUL BE LIKE SHOW HIM HOW ITS DONE.,7
Brilliant bowling by Cottrell. He's on fire today.,5
Kohli nudges and ends up with 60 off 50 balls. He removes the mask and it will be revealed that it was MSD,8
RCB IS BACK !,7
Kohli almost playing his WC Semi knock,8
RCB looking to beat their 49 all out total,7
I thought y'all were joking with the 49-10 comments but holy fuck,7
"that's how you catch

young contact less eyes",2
This was not Kohli's day,2
"And we thought, RCB can win",2
Which part is the score and wickets in 4-3?,7

I was joking about 40 all out I think they’re gonna do exactly that wtf.,11
19 yr old showing Kohli how to catch a skier,7
***Sad RCB noises***,4
The first match was an anomaly. Now it's back to the norm for RCB. :),7
RCB will drop  Phillipe and he will make a ton of runs for some other team.,7
Biggest joke on me for taking Umesh Yadav in place of Cottrell.,7
"Chakk de phatte, napp de killi, swere Jalandhar shaam nu Dilli",6

ya rcb flairs talk nah,10
"Bad luck for Kohli there, if only Kohli had been fielding under that ball, he could have kept batting",66
"Thala: Yeah r/cricket, talk nah",10
Yup! This year isn't going to be anywhere near to 2016 for Virat I guess.,5
5-3 please.,3
Fuck this. Next match please.,7
Nice to see RCB back to form after that uncharacteristic performance in the first match. Brilliant batting by Koach.,9
Fucking hell. Every year it’s different people yet it’s always the same result. How the fuck do they constantly fail to deliver as a unit,10
"I called it before

Kohli: We were 70-80 runs short,5
This is when Dhoni would have used his master tactics and played to salvage the NRR 😂,6

Kohli did a Dhoni and Pant in same innings,3
RCB gonna best their previous lowest total,2

C'mon RCB you can break the 49 all out record.,2
Philippe and Gaikwad were mere lambs sacrificed to protect the gods.,1
"How many years should we keep the same captain.

Imagine slandering a team who are 5-3 ahead,15

Fucking Kohli is ever so unreliable nowadays when it comes to high pressure situations. 2019 and 2015 WC semi finals come to mind instantly,6
UNPOPULAR OPINION ab is a better chaser than kohli in ipl,6
Lolololololololololol,2
the game against srh was a one-off,8
What's the point of all the fitness during lockdown? Rohit chilling with vada pav and still bats so much better,44

Kohli had a great match lol,4
When are they going to make tough decisions over at RCB? Same strategy every year expecting different results. Maybe Kohli should take a pay cut so they can get a better surrounding cast. They look like the biggest idiots for releasing KL in the last mega auction,2
"DAE Dhoni smart for giving up chase early?

So RCB playing for NRR?,2
Kohli gives up WAYYYYYYY too easily. The entire team looks defeated. One thing i love about dhoni and Rohit is.... They use their brain and don't accept or show defeat in their body language. Even if they lose. Koach ain't a good critical thinking captain. Won't change my mind.,7

Padikkal
Finch
Kohli
ABD

Udana
Sundar
Parthiv
Morris/Steyn
Saini
Chahal

Steyn will bowl his overs upfront and in middle and will play only till morris does not recover form injury. The death overs will be delivered by Saini, Udana and Morris once he returns. Parthiv will play as a specialist keeper who will only bat once a while like 2-3 times in whole tournament. Also the team will have batting till 9 once Morris returns. Kohli also have to be smart in using Sundar's 4 overs and you will have a pretty decent attack and also batting.",1
Teams have just been unable to give any sort of fight chasing in this IPL,3
I don't know why fellow CSK fans are using this to defend dhoni. What Dhoni did last match was wrong. No questions asked.,7
I'm just here to see how bad RCB's NRR will be after the match. -3? -4 doesn't seem too radical either.,9

This is the issue if they immediately go after the target. Now RCB has the risk of getting a huge NRR loss if they don't get close to the target.",8
Kohli is shit lmao,2
Shami and Cottrel bowling so well. Great stuff.,1
There are good teams and there are bad teams and there is 50 feet of crap and then there we are,8

Terrible chase so far. Bowlers are bowling brilliantly and one has to respect that. Once the batsmen are set any ball can be hit. This is the last critical pair and RCB has a long tail. Goal should be to get as close as possible with NRR being critical as well.,1

RCB should play someone like Udana or Negi if Morris is not fit. As much as I love Steyn he's not in good rhythm. They need a good bowling all rounder.,1
This is a disaster if that's out,7
For RCB to win next 4 overs have to be given to Umesh Yadav,2

I said it in the last match and I'm saying it again. Only way to fix RCB is dropping Kohli for Parthiv.,4

1) Hey this looks close, Idk wtf I'm doing here --- Not out

2) Hey this looks close, Idk wtf I'm doin' here --- Out",6
How long before on field umpires become redundant? We have the tech already.,3
Idk if anyone of you watch RCB YouTube account... but its sooo extra and then they come out with this kind of performance,3
"I know it's not out but surely they shouldn't check for the LBW? RCB reviewed it, if finch hasn't edged it then he should be not out and if KXIP think it's LBW then theyre free to review it. Checking the LBW defeats the point of the review system",6

They both want to let their teammates have a go at the ball to get used to the conditions at this unusual IPL.",4

Tbh anything is possible with ab De villiers batting,5
Go the Thala way. You don't want to fuck up your NRR here.,6

AB will drag us to atleast 130. I believe in him,8

Ab is a legend tbh to play like this at 36 is phenomenal,2
"I saw Mohammed Shami at a grocery store in Amroha yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.

He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”

I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen hair serums in his hands without paying.

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

When she took one of the cream and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each cream and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.

Overall a nice dude. Love him.",7
De Villiers never play like he is a part of Team RCB.,7
Is Cotrrel the player who does the notebook celebration?,3
Kohli peaked in 2016 with 960 or so runs. All downhill from that season,10
Can we just clone AB,7
KXIP can't calm down until de Villiers is out. Man can chase the whole thing on his own.,10
"He looks in good touch, plz don't get out",6
"tbf if you're chasing 180 in 15 overs, you can do worse than Finch and de Villiers",7
RCB should stop retaining AB only then we will see a player score 1000+ runs with a SR of 250,9
"Anyone remember that Delhi vs csk match in 2009 I think. They were chasing around 200, Delhi lose early quick wickets. AB plays an insane innings and wins the game for DD.",12

ABD or Gayle",9
Perfect time to get Ashwin in now,7
"KXIP don't have good death bowlers either, if AB can stay till the end it will be interesting.",8
I still can't believe Delhi were stupid enough to let ABdV go.,12
These two gotta stick till the last over for the least amount of chance,5
We need abd out.,4
Is Dube a good death bowler?,2
AB counterattacks in the middle of a collapse are the peak of cricket.,8
Kohli in this match was very sus. I vote him as the imposter. What's your say?,24

shot AB,2
if finch gets going this could actually be a game,2
"I know this game is over, but just can't put it off because you have to watch AB when he's batting.",3
"Come on Aaron, imagine that you’re playing for Gujarat lions and u should be good to go",7
Finch might have to bat till the 8th over without risks! Clearly AB has better timing and naturally would counterattack! But losing both wickets would take a huge hit on their NRR,3
"Cottrell doesn't look quick, but the last one was 140+",4
You know what is tragedy... We loosing against RCB in opning match,12
"What is the reason that Shami looks so threatening off a length that is hittable for a lot of other bowlers? I know it's accurate but he's still on a length, and there isn't a lot of movement?",6

"If Finch also pulls off his weight, they can still make a match of it.",8
"RCB seriously need to change their name to have any chance of getting anywhere closer to the trophy. How can you be a winner if you're always a challenger? 

Challenger was also the name of the spacecraft that unfortunately went up in flames during liftoff killing everyone on board.

You know what else is called the Challenger? The deepest point in the earth's ocean systems. Bet RCB can find a way to plumb deeper than that.",24
AB loves scoring against KXIP apparently. One more time please ABD,6

Rahul hurt his back :(,7

ABD is the king of counterattacks,5
ABD on crease bowlers starts giving freebies to RCB on their own.,6
I like Cottrell's slow loping runup,7

Virat Kohli was the imposter,15
Let's give dev to KKR next season and Aaron to RR,3
I just love the little windmill AB does every time he hits it hard,6

We're up for some ABD heroics guys,5
I wanted to see Bishnoi vs Kohli but Bishnoi vs ABD will do just fine.,1

RCB has finally touched an RR of 5,2
You score 11 runs an over and run rate still increases,1
"Whenever kohli screws up in the first innings, he almost always gets out for a very low score in the second innings. Seems like a massive mental block",7

There goes ABD trying to save Koach's ass once again..,6
Hope they don't make bishnoi a scape goat,6

"AB has been surprisingly fluent in the two games till now, considering he has been out of professional cricket for a while now. Probably has played a only a handful of BBL matches in the past 18 months or so.",2
Hope is dangerous for Rcb fan,8
"Kohli having a bad individual game and people calling him a shit captain???¿¿¿¿

Logic?

Note: I'm not saying he's a good captain, just think it's weird to go after his captaincy after a bad individual game, not one where his decisions have necessarily been bad",1
The real question is how would Kohli’s performance tonight be rated compared to Dhoni’s couple of night ago,4
Hahaha. RCB fans roasting themselves. Have some faith ppl.,6
"*Mike Hesson breaks down door* ""Are ya winning son?""",6

Guy couldn't bat even his life depended on it. But I digress. Anyways a similar story today - hapless RCB defeated at the hands of Bangalore bullies. But Fatty Finchy is the happiest man alive because now's KFC time.",15

"Imagine MSD got out instead of Kohli, the hate would've been so much here. It'll be talked on the next game too",8
20/3 and commentators talking about Finch's forward defence lol,4
Finch finally looking decent now. C'mon boys,4
My friend who is a RCB fan is getting absolutely thrashed on whatsapp group lmfaoo,8
Virat Kohli.... I am sorry Babu.,4
[removed],1
The colour red is cursed for sure! I pity Ferrari and RCB fans!,3
[deleted],2
Rcb has regained their glory all hail King kohli.....2019 ipl is back!,3
Spin pies. This is what Finchy has been waiting for,2
Wtf is this bowling.,1
"AB is gonna drag us past KL Rahul's score, let's gooooooo boys!",7
"So I started watching cricket again in April 2019 for the first time since 2012, and since then I've watched almost all live cricket. If I didn't know that Kohli is the potential GOAT I would have thought he was a bang average player with one or two good innings.",6
"**Virat Kohli vs left-arm pace in the since beginning of last season in IPL (including today)**

Balls 38

Runs 53

Dismissals 5

SR 139.40",7
This would be a big over,3
"Fuck sake Finch, there is ugly slogging and then there is whatever the fuck you are doing.",8
bc kitne wide,2
Bishnoi's radar off so far tonight,5
"He gave away his move, bowler still let him hit",3
"You take 3 early wickets and ABD walks in. 


Folks, I have an idea to fix Indian middle order.",12
If only one of ABD or Finch sticks through the end we are toast,5
Punjab trying to out RCB RCB.,10
Good job rcb . No 49 all out today I guess,7
"I am not saying Finch-AB should take risks but they should totally take risks 


unless taking the CSK approach",4
I always believed Kohli got a shit team but now I think it's CHAHAL who is stranded in RCB,22
Wrong pitch Bishnoi,5
Bishnoi for 5 wickets,2
Shastri as RCB coach is so needed,4
"They're clearly trying to get away from Bishnoi's line 
 
Probably because of his low bounce and how hard he is to get under",2
i have a feeling that umesh is the impostor,6
What is he aiming at?!??,3
Finch and AbD take the game to 150-160. And then Dube ji will come and finish the game.,4
"ABD

ABD

ABD",3
We got a umesh academy contender in spin department now,2
how do u bowl this consistently wide,8
"Bishnoi fucked the u19 Aussies

Now Big Boi Finch is going to fuck Bishnoi",2
Bishnoi intimidated/put off by AB?,6
WE NEED MORE DEW,5
Will RCB replace kohli as the captain midseason ?,6
Young Man on pressure,2
"Kohli is done I guess

He won't be the same pre 2019 Kohli anymore

Pretty sad as a die hard fan of him",5
That is about the cleanest hit ive ever seen from ABD,5
"Man i keep remembering how kohli was at his peak. Absolutely untouchable, no flashy sixes just quick running and orgasmic wrist shots to the boundary",10
[deleted],-7
That's better,2
Bishnoi coming back,2
Terrible idea to bring a young leg spinner in the powerplay.,2
Is Bhisnoi innovating or improvising?,6
Finally some air to that ball,3
No team can give you entertainment like RCB.,6
Today's Punjab's performance is similar to my girlfriend's one yesterday night. Too good to believe! I am so happy for both😁😀👍🏽,-1
SA cricket is missing a lot without ABD,11
"Dube is like yeah Bishnoi like I learned, this isn't Under 19 anymore..",9
"Ab baby on attack

Thats the intent fuckers",14
"Btw a quick fact for RCB fans:


Hesson was the coach for KXIP last year. He had a big fallout with the management. It was so bad, that Hesson's ticket was booked to return to New Zealand. Logic prevailed and he continued the season. This is from Joy Bhattacharya. He didn't take the name. Said ""a NZ coach""",27
"A good chance for Dube bhai , get a fifty now , show RCBs shitty management how good of a player he is",3
Cotrell dressed like a baseball player?,13
Cottrells socks look like hes playing baseball,14
AB is a treat to watch irrespective of the team you support. He is so imposing that he overwhelms any bowler. Poor Bishnoi. He has never bowled to anyone like AB.,7
anything can happen as long as ABD is there,6
bishnoi vs AB will be great contest,0
ravi bishnoi's name sounds like that of a sarpanch from rural india mid-1980's,9
Cottrell turned into a baseball player after that dive,13
Bishnoi is adjusting his deliveries well. These commentators are retarded.,8
Cottrell seems crazy athletic. Damn,9
Is Anjum Chopra the Umesh Yadav of commentary?,7
Who is that dead voice in the dugout comms?,-4
"Over-rated batsman and personally I see nothing special in his batting. I enjoy watching English and Australian batsmen more than this Kohli

edit: whooooooooosh r/cricket",-15
Cottrell should be banned for that Pants and sock setup,12
I want RCB to do well but I also want Bishnoi to bowl well :(,12
Intent^TM,5
"""Wicket ke liye daal, bachane ke liye mat daal."" - KL

T: Bowl to take wickets, not to save runs",11
Wow that's a nice delivery,2
If Kohli doesn't improve soon D U B E will be eyeing the captaincy,13
Why not start with Ashwin ffs,4
Ravi Bishnoi only bowling googlies.,4
RRR only 11.93 💐,3
"ABD is selfish he shouldn't have retired, South Africa needs him desperately.

He still plays well",9
Ravi needs to be more brave.,1
"Seriously if somebody gonna create a post asking if RCB gonna change captain mid season. I'm gonna attack. 
Yes, Kohli had a shitty day. Stop reading too much into it.",7
Who is the hottest IPL captain? Imma go w KL,9
"Kumble , after winning the game and during handshake,should start slow clapping in front of kohli",6
KXIP need another wicket here before they can breathe,3
Cottrell's got the gridiron pants on,1
"'Cottrells legs when he slides can make him go to Kanyakumari' 
Loving this tamil commentary",12
Pooran's shoes are quite distracting,3
I see a lot of people disrespecting Big Daddy Kohli here. It will be remembered,3
If ABD goes so goes RCB,3
[deleted],1
Bishnoi's action is me after 3 pegs showing my friends I could have played for India if I really tried.,18
Seeing little to no RCB flairs here 👀,2
"Thats fucking Finchy right there. None of that pansy ass dick tugging smile for the camera bullshit. Finchy will puke, Finchy will poop on the pitch, Finchy will deliver his new born baby at the crease and eat a bucket of KFC at the same time. Fucking hard core dick in the ass butterball cricket fuck it boot-it game time shit.",21
The walmart R Ashwin is in,14
"Great stroke , finch annaq",1
[deleted],8
Ravi Ashwin's less ethical brother,25
"I studied in Karnataka, I was the lone CSK fan in the college bus and yet the whole bus couldn't argue with me due to RCB's performance.! I used to wait for RCB to perform badly and things are still the same for RCB as it was 10 years ago lmao!!!",9
Remind me again... Why is gowtham not playing?,7
Cottrell needs a pinch of chewing tobacco stuffed in to his top gum to complete the baseball aesthetic,3
Steyn looking hilarious without the headband,6
Both spinners been too far down leg so far,3
Downvote me but M Ashwin is just painfully bad,-3
Watch as RCB loses 7 within the next 5 runs.,3
"See this is the issue, KXIP have Cottrell, Shami and fuckall else to bowl. Could give Maxwell the ball to see if that does anything.",3
Come on 5 more!,4
Ahh I'm having a bad feeling here 😅,7
"We shouldn't have let RAshwin go, he would've mankaded the fuck out of ABD by now 😔",11
I like this Indian commentator,1
If finch keeps on rotating strike we r in with a gud chance,5
"Take it deep Finchy, take it deep",5
"Guys, don't lose hope. There's still time for 49/10.",10
M Ashwin has been practicing a new delivery apparently called the 'Zooter',3
Tamil commentary is funny AF LMAOO,12
Yeah Ashwin is gonna be targeted. Both.,4
"Whats up with Sheldon's pants, straight out from the race course",3
kxip is going to rely too heavily on rahul this year. they need gayle in,5
Now I get it. KXIP didn't retain Ashwin to avoid naming clash!,5
Coming back to r/cricket after a break. The match threads seem to have more trolls gracing us with their presence.,9
GIVE NEESH THE BALL,6
Terrible idea to give Ravi the last over of PP. That got both the batsmen going.,6
"Poor from RCB, KXIP have a weak bowling lineup, so should have just tried to avoid losing wickets in the first 3-4 overs to Shami & cottrell who are the main bowlers.",11
"Realistically, how many more years can Kohli still play? Asking for a friend.",10
4/7 incoming,-5
The leg spinners are bowling all over the place,7
This game could use a mankad.,22
Finch is quite the manlet,7
"People on this thread are like.

""If AbD gOeS sO dOeS rCb"" 

No shit Sherlock.",7
M Ashwin looks like a 2nd round interviewer from a Tech MNC.,13
That's a brilliant throw from that off-balanced position,5
RCB in tough spot. ABD : Now this looks like a job for me,10
They need To bring Mujeeb in somehow,5
Watching uncapped players bowling leg spin just gives the idea how difficult is it to master the art of leg spin and bowl right lines consistently at the highest level,6
Sheldon is so up his own ass about all the military stuff. You don't need to showboat everytime.,-6
"To be honest it'd be amazing if RCB end up making 180 from here. Somehow cannot get myself to see KXIP win big, or RCB lose too bad.",6
"**Cringe alert**: *""KL Rahul means Kadak Ladka Rahul""*  

- Sehwag",15
"Kohli is 31 .

Another 5-6 years RCB gets nothing. We have accept this",7
Lol anyone listening to the Tamil commentary? I am literally crying from laughter😂😂,5
Am I tripping or does Ashwin have a new action?,2
Big thanks to IPL for reaffirming the facts that Kohli is a clueless captain and Dhoni is past it.,14
Scenes if ABD gets mankaded by M. Ashwin,10
"Gotta ask, what’s happened to kohli man",4
RCB slowly getting there,1
"Ab kept wickets in bbl

Why isnt he doing the same in ipl

Will empty 1 overseas slot",3
"🚨🚨WE DID IT WE PASSED 49🚨🚨

FUCK YES JOB FUCKING DONE TAKE THAT HATERS",14
Bishnod,5
"The dreaded score has been averted boys, can sleep without having nightmares tonight",2
RCB desperately needs a match winner. I say sell Kohli off and buy Stuart Binny as replacement and make Umesh captain.,5
we are going to cross 49. Morale victory guys,3
"Sorry Bishnoi, we need a fifty from you...",4
49 averted,3
Only 12 behind at this stage is surprising,2
Muhammad Ashwin. Mmm. When did he change his religion?,5
"You've heard of the Travis Scott Burger, now heres the Aaron Finch KFC box; Two large thighs, a rump, and small wings",6
Ah 50 thank god,4
Play only one among Maxwell/pooran and bring in Mujeeb for the next game,3
"RCB fans: 2020 will be something different.

2020: Sorry, even I can't change some things.",9
Inb4 lord Umesh comes out and smashes 70* (20),1
[deleted],3
2s in the middle overs ain't gonna help boys.,2
Match is over. Time to wrap it up.,4
ABD and Finchy are gonna take it home!,2
King had a shitty day today,3
"With that ""O teri"", it seems KL has fully embraced the Punjab culture.",14
"If they make 75+ in 10 and don’t lose more than 2 wickets till then end, RCB are winning",8
We should but Maxwell next year,2
Damn son.,2
Cottrell is working hard on field today,4
how wierd would it feel if we dont retain kohli next year,1
canNOT believe lee and styris are commentating just hours after losing their friend/colleague. brett lee's presence in the dugout is even more baffling since he performed CPR on deano. styris struggled with his words more than once. downright cruel if this was forced on them!,8
Bishnoi you beauty,8
lol,1
Beautiful ball,2
Aye bhai bhai bhai...,5
Virat Kohli,6
Its night night for RCB,6
"Ah man, just when I was getting my hopes up",4
AW HELL YEAH!,5
Let's goooo Bishnoi,8
"Above 49, do whatever you want now",6
My boy Bishnoi!,5
Did rcb sell Parthiv Patel and bring in phillipe? Absolute dumbfucks,5
This lad is quite good. It drifted in afterwards.,8
Let's see how far AB alone can take them,10
RCB fans seem so dead inside that I wonder what they would do should they ever win the title some day.,14
Finch got out like twice right there lmao,5
"Kohli got paid $164,000 USD for today’s performance",22
Ya Bish,2
Finch finally put out of misery.,6
"I am feeling normal now, actually thought RCB would be mid table atleast",10
finch was batting just to avert the 49 crisis,7
YES BISH GET IN THERE,5
Hey Murli Vijay!,3
Ravi fucking Bishnoi.,5
Beauty from Bishnoi,3
Timbaa,1
And now Finch is gone,5
Bishnoi you beauty,8
Bishnoi heard you guys talking smack,12
"**7.5** Ravi Bishnoi to Finch, OUT, **has he bowled him? Or is it caught behind?** Looks good for both. It is bowled. Short of a length, skidding onwards and clipping the top of off as Finch exposes middle and off to try and play the cut **53-4**

AJ Finch  b Ravi Bishnoi 20 (21b 3x4 0x6) SR: 95.23",3
Fuck. Two bad days for Finch.,4
Finch is a T20 dud,1
Finch was just out there to stop the 49 all out memes,6
Too bad there's no Dhoni to help with the NRR...,5
Where are the people laying into Bishnoi for 1 bad over now ?,9
Must feel so awesome getting an international player out as 20 year old,10
"That was great from Bishnoi , after the first over .",3
I bet not a single RCB fan was expecting Finch to win it for them.,19
What was cooking with maxi and finchy?,4
All the gear no idea lol,2
[deleted],11
Back to losing ways RCB,5
"It's 2020, don't expect kohli to chase well",7
Finch after 8 Franchise changes still not able to crack IPL.,10
"RCB need to bring Moeen Ali next game, Finch has played tuk tuk style in both matches.",3
"Hexagon

Pentagon

Dodecagon

Matchgone",8
Aah there's going to be some mandatory drops in the next match! Missed it in this one,3
Ffs. Can an Australian i want to watch play actually do something apart from Saint Dev? Stoin doesn't count,7
"Jesus it's not AARAWN Finch, it's Aaron",5
Bish please,2
AB is mental enough to win with Dube and Sundar at the other end. Kings XI need to get AB out before they relax.,1
RCB should bring in Morris and Moeen for Finch and Philip and exchange Umesh for Parthiv.,2
Kohli needs to be sacked too emotional,3
Finch has never been good against spin. Rcb fans thinking their batting was strengthened due to finch being in was just hype,2
Maxwell unhappy his friend Finch got out,2
"No trustable bat left

Ab shud start going hell for leather now",0
"If it's a caught behind and a bowled that should be 2 wickets, fuck the batriarchy",4
Send back Finch and Phillipe and sign Marnus Labuschagne,3
cmon dube prove to us that u can bat,3
I will worship ABD and Washi if they get us to a respectable total,4
Ahh the typical /r/cricket flame into a good performance by the flamee.,2
rcb back to rcb ways,1
Night watchman is here. He just needs to play out 12 overs today.,1
Abd: ah shit here we go again.,1
Let’s see what beautiful has got,1
Absence of NEHARAJi in support staff is clearly showing in RCBs performance,-1
Washington Vetrivel can save us now.,2
The only way they can chase this total is with i n t e n t™.,0
Are teams losing a lot while chasing lately?,4
sundar can actually bat,6
Why not send dube ? Koach making koach decisions,2
Sees bails flying. It's an edge there. Top comms Simon.,0
This has a very SRH vs RCB from last year's vibe to it!,3
"Yeah keep insulting Dube , don't give him chance .

Wait till he goes to Mumbai and score 85(28)",8
"Fuck you guys

Kohli won the fucking toss. That's 50% of the game won... Apparently

Now you guys want him to field and bat too!? ffs",11
Glad to see rcb playing  in comfortable positions now,-1
RCB fans need a fucking break from this shit man,5
why is RCB’s collapse so entertaining,4
"We rarely get to see Sundar bat, let's see how he does today",1
[removed],1
Spain but the s is silent,6
"We have so much batting depth(if maxwell even gets like a 20 average), our bowling is top heavy but bishnoi looks solid",2
So this is what playing with intent gets you. In that case it's better to follow thala strategy,5
These UAE pitches are bad for chasing,2
Oh that sound off the bat. Fuck me.,0
I have no interest in a RCB win. But would love to see ABD get them there.,-1
three days three failed chases ( don't be so hopeful today) good for teams batting first,1
Just hit me Wrong-un and Googly is same thing. 😂😭,3
Thanks Agent Sarfaraz,8
Ok effort but that really shouldn't have been 4 lol,3
"As long as AbD is there, there's hope 🤞",1
"Almost got it, Sarfaraz",3
Bishnoi already second best wristspinner in the country,1
What's with the fielding quality this match,2
The 4 was a combined effort,1
sarfaraz doing the wap dance instead of fielding,6
"I rate sundar as a batsman, atleast how much I've seen him bat",9
Done for,4
This fatty Sarfaraz,4
Fuck I'm dead. AB nooooooo,5
Fuck me Kholi Finch Fillpe down and they still have ABD and Washington to bank on. That's some serious batting,3
Game over,3
"RCB has a long ass tail wtf Sundar at 6? Guy is a bowling all rounder, and that is stretching it",4
Absolute state,5
"Kohli: ... In how many do we win?

Dr. Strange: 0️⃣",26
Lol,2
ABD also gone F,8
All out incoming,4
This was our year !!! Good night bros.,9

Murugan you beauty,10

KP Commentators Curse OP,8
"So what if he is OUT. So what??  
  
At least there was i n t e n t™.",14
Aaaaaand that's the game..,10
quick rename rcb to abd no one will know,2
"Om Muruga... why you do this? 


did I just jinx ABD :|",5
lmao,2
"Oof, feel bad for Sarfaraz. But at least he didn't drop a catch.",4
Chaalo well played boys,2
"Captain of the Indian team dropping catches - no problem. 
Someone else on the team drops it? Gonna get a mouthful from Kohli. 

If you can’t lead by example Kohli should step down gracefully. 

Yea this is RCB vs KX1P thread and I’m here rambling.",9
they're gone,2
Googly,2
Dhoni: Now you know. Now you know.,4
"Okay, time to go to sleep.",2
What the actual fuck..,1
Game. Set. Match.,2
RIP,1
Classic RCB,3
Dale Steyn has probably got more runs than any rcb batsmen today,11
RIP RCB,2
Yup RCB has lost this match,5
Match is over.. Good night folks,4
Well guess who’s not RCB lite motherfuckers,28
"Welcome to 2020, RCB",14
Game over,3
Delete club,9
Now bring on the pacers and put RCB outta their misery,7
F,2
"And, it's done.

Balance restored. KKR losing to MI. RCB being RCB.

Feels normal",20
Anyone who has seen the cherry blossoms there would agree that Washington Sundar hai,4
F,3
Nazar na lage by God.,3
Pack it up motherfuckers,7
Pressure on Chahal to deliver with the bat.,16
**Dhoom Punjabiiiiii**,4
RCB can't even save their NRR lmao,13
"Team of Champions, not a champion team.",13
"Intent loses you matches horribly, dumbasses",3
RCBelly laugh,4
Aaaand we’re done.,5
[deleted],11
"""They should have played it safe and prevented NRR from falling""",11
Loooool gotta love a classic RCB performance,9
The only positive here is that they didn't get out on 49,6
Do we really need the timeout ? Just end our misery,8
Can we relegate an IPL team mid-game?,5
KKR and RCB chasing making CSK chase saner and saner as much as I was sad the other day .,14
F,1
"Ah yes, there's the RCB we all know and love",7
M Ashwin played for RCB,7
ABD attended Hogwarts and his wand is a Willow,2
Don’t worry y’all....we got shivam (6 hitter) dube,3
RCB fans be like: Aight Imma head out,7

Hahahaha...rcb nrr is gonna get fucked,6
The only thing left is Quantum of loss,2
Badri kinda dissing ABD here,4
Triple digit score possible now?,3
All right what are your predictions for Quantum of Loss^TM? Mine is 90 runs,1
Smashaanam Samaaptham !!,2
"57-5 and I don't even feel that sad. You don't expect a lot from this team except some entertainment lol. And entertainment is guaranteed with RCB, win or lose",16
RCB gonna RCB,8
Normally RCB beats the shit out of KXIP so this is indeed 2020,11
Bishnoi getting a player out playing for the googly is just bewildering. He is so different to normal players.,4
Just delete this team,27
And we're back to classic RCB shenanigans. God help us,8
RCB please reach 100 atleast,4
The NRR gains from this match will be massive,15
Grats we crossed first milestone of our own record 49,9
Nice demonstration of intent shown by RCB players. The intent to end match fast and watch chota bheem post match,7
Rcb is alllll talk. Allll hype. No results. 🥱🥱🥱🥱,6
im starting to think dhonis strategy wasnt too bad,8
There was only room for one Ashwin in Punjab,8
"""Good evening Pom"" me to my English coworker at Friday drinks",7
"RCB is a team made just for memes , and kohli being captain is not coincidence its all planned lol",11
Poor toss decision from VK. Clearly batting first has worked,0
Lord Dube's hundred?,4
"If Morris isn't fit surely you drop Phillipe for Mo? Make AB keep or if he doesn't want to, drop Sundar as well and bring in PP",5
This is gonna help KXIP's NRR considering they tied the first game!,8
You know its RCB when even in an unusual year like 2020 they keep shitting their bed.,8
"Ok, good night folks!",1
"KKR : our nnr is so shit.

RCB : lmao hold my sambhar",18
"Okay, good night",3

Authentic RCB performance,3
Shivam dube boutta get 100,3
"RCB won't beat KXIP today, maybe they can beat Rahul's score?",13
Kohli gonna be like we would have won the game had i not dropped that catch lol dont think so,6
"KKR : We've just had the worst performance for NRR, we're in a big hole and have to struggle our way up. 

RCB : Hold my beer",11
alright over/under 100?,2
This is not the approach! Learn from CSK you fools!!!,10
I'm taking bets for the odds that RCB won't be able to beat Rahul's score in this match.,11
Net run rate predictions for RCB?,0
And it's time for quantum of loss.,5
Nice of them to cut off the dugout crew while they were talking about a tribute to Deano to show a stupid hotstar ad,5
RCB don't even have Cummins to save their nrr..haha,4
Right its a wrap,1
This is one end of the nonsense spectrum after Dhoni showed us the other end of the spectrum against RR.,1
"""That RCB jersey is curse""- Melisandre  2008




""Bitch STFU and undress yourself""- Vijay Malaya 2008",10
"2020 - Can't perform worse than me..

RCB - Hold my beer..",6
They build up the hope then they crush it ruthlessly.,3
RCB should drop Kohli,7
Well set for Umesh Yadav 50(26) redemption.,2
"I feel RCB will do better under any other captain. Kohli’s strategies and team selection is bizarre for every season, and he starts getting his combinations right only in last 5 matches or so.",13
Bruh this is the first year I'm watching IPL and was confused about the RCB memes until today,15
Rcb is bettering kkr,2
[I will eat my words](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/iyw2o9/-/g6fuli8),4
Kohli is defo the imposter vote him out,6
Kohli : We were 15-20 innings short,10
"I think I'm at the point where I unironically like the Warnie hair clinic ad

Help!!",6
An all-round shit show of a performance by RCB today,4
Who knew dropped catches can cost the match right?,5
Early to say but I think punjab and delhi surely shd be the  top contender for trophy  though punjab may lack a experience spinner. With csk and Mumbai taking other 2 spots,3
Restart season right now.,1
"Jesus, imagine being the former number one batsman in the world and getting out to Murugan Ashwin",5

Thanks to RCB i think match will end in time for once,2
Namma ooru Murugannnnn ashwinnnn yessss get innnnn got the world's best out.,6
Hopefully now they’ll stop overhyping RCB. You need to give them a massive spanking to bring the commentators and experts back to reality.,5
Umesh 70* (20). I called it first,6
Rcb being rcb,2
"note to self, if you’re chasing on this pitch just don’t watch",1
"karnataka beat bangalore, not a surprise",6
so sweet of rcb to swoop in here and give kkr a proper shot at qualifying.,1
RCB are why we didnt qualify last year. Absolutely fucking obliterated our nrr. Fucking travesty lmao. This has to be revenge,13
Best top 5?,3
All round terrible performance by RCB,4
Why is everybody sad? No fans of Punjab? I love K11P,12
"Punjab, please give RCB a follow on right now",1

"Kohli has a huge selection problem. I remember Bhubaneswar kumar giving a motm performance in the first test vs SA 2018, but kohli dropped in the next game for no valid reason. Same thing happened with parthiv Patel. He scored heavily for RCB last year but he is nowhere near the team this year. Kohli , for no reason, drops players who perform well",15

Already can't wait for post match kohli interview,8
RCB is back,1
"VK always cowardly with his captaincy, he won the toss - any proactive captain confident about their teams bowling would go for batting first considering they won the first match defending a score and always better to post a score and defend the total considering its a huge ass ground. But ofcourse he chooses to chase, and i am not even going to talk about his in-field captaincy and worse, single handedly dropping the match (and twice!)",2

Yup enough IPL for me today,4
"I thought cricket needed to be competitive to be watchable. I stand corrected, this match is eminently watchable.",3
I know it's just two matches in and we did massively fuck up in the previous match but I'm getting a good feeling about the way our team is being set up this season. The frankly bizarre gambles of the past two seasons are no longer there. Things on the pitch make sense,5
Kumble Laughing at Koach,7
Can't blame kohli for the drops if rcb doesn't even reach 100...underwater 6d chess,3

RCB NRR now : Not Stonks.,10
No shame in losing but RCB capitulate in such a way when posed with a challenge that they could drain Ranveer Singh of his energy.,8
Maxwell undoubtedly has a full beard right now,6
"Imagine losing to RCB, yes looking at you SRH",12
"Listen, in bg, again the Dark Knight chants. Is the revolution coming or something?",4
Maxi is a class act.,10
SRH were so bad that day... They lost to this RCB,18
wonder why the sound technicians aren’t blasting the RCB chant now,10
"Admit it, in our heart, we all wanted Shivam Kallis to succeed.",5
"I just realised Kumble is the only Indian coach in the IPL

I C L M",2
Isn’t sundar an all rounder? He is slogging more than anything,2
Kl should bowl for trolling,11
"""We'll have a bowl, thank you""",11
What's the point of audience background noise now?,4
Srh lost to this rcb hhaaha,4

Nooooooo Umeshaaaaa,5
Umeshhhh,4
OYE HOYE BISHNOI,12
"Remember when people said Kohli scored a meaningless 90 against MI in a 200 chase in 2018 even when they knew the game was lost! That actually helped their NRR and all they had to do was win the last game! I know they messed it up against RR though! 

Finch should have done that today! Would have helped him cement his place and get the timing too! But the point is those kind of big knocks might help in the long haul of an entire season! CSK on the other hand was in the game the other day and should have gone for the chase!",12
U'meme Yadav,9
Oh no this match is gone now,5
"Umesh be like I am ""Rakheem Cornwall""..",6
"Koach out!

Koach out!

Koach out!",9
Oh fucks sake. This is BS.,3
Nooooo. Ummi was supposed to hit 70(20)  :(,11
NRR loss will be quite big. Rip rcb this season.,5
RCB is not even playing for NRR. Lmao,1
At least Umesh didn't start at -40,6
"Lol what are they're swinging for, morons literally",5
I’d rather have Dhoni’s tuk tuk than this,7
"Waiting for the ' They may not win, but they are the most entertaining team with the most loyal fanbase' picture on facebook now",12
they won't even get to a 100 at this rate,2
Rcb need to bat out the 20 overs to stay in the tournament.,2
Umesh with the best knock of the match 0 (2),3
What's NRR?,10
Everybody in here trolled Kl rahul for his performance in the last match and today they are full of praise.. same is happening with Kohli today,3
"So, how much does a 100-run defeat affect the NRR? Asking for a friend.",13
UMESH YADAV FAILED US,11
"**13.6** Ravi Bishnoi to Yadav, OUT, **into leg stump!** Good length, coming in with his regular angle, and also spinning in off the pitch. Umesh shaping for the big slog sweep but is through the shot too soon **88-7**

Dube will be a housemate in the big boss house in a few years from now. You heard it here first.,11
"Lord and savior Umesh gone, match def lost now for RCB",8
What's the best client for Reddit on Android for live comments? So that the comments feed gets refreshed itself. Specially useful for live game threads.,14
Umesh is the least sharpest tool in the shed,10
Good start? The opposition team had a major injury and made some really silly mistakes. Maybe you shouldn’t have overhyped them in the first place.,13
RCB lose to kl rahul by a huge margin,5
Srh losing to rcb is sad this is really sad.....f for their middle order,8
Sundar needs to bat till the end and ensure RCB avoid the follow on.,13
Kohli: We were ~~15-20~~ 80-90 runs short,20
Bishnoi is definately winning the Emerging Player of the Tournament award,9

Ati sundar,2
"KXIP look so good, Maxwell needs to come in form again and they're set.",7
Note for other teams: Play Bishnoi as an off-spinner,6
Lol SRH lost cus of that Warner freak run out and we were a batsman down cus of the Mitch injury.,6
The only thing left to watch is whether RCB even crosses a 100,4
Atleast they are swinging and showing i n t e n t™.,6
Umesh was planning to hit that straight to india,4
Who's downvoting lol?,4
At least beat KL's score of 132😂,10
Sholay's Thakur would have played a better shot than Umesh Yadav there,2
Memers will have their hands full today.,8
[deleted],10
I have bigger biceps than bishnoi.,7
OHHHHHH NOOOOOOO!! Why Lord Umesh????,4
We are not reaching even 100 thus wasting KL Rahul's colossal effort  pushing him into depression which will ruin his form from next match. This is RCB for you.,8
at this point im sure KL Rahul has Maxwell as his captain in Dream11,6
"We need to get Morris, Ali and and Parthiv in instead of Philippe, Umesh and Steyn",3
Ipl fielding,1
Kl rahul getting a huge NRR what about punjab tho....,3
"If my calculations are right, then RCB have to score 99 to stay above KKR in nrr (yes they have 2 points but still fyi)",4
Why the fuck did RCB give Qdk to MI when they got him at such a bargain. Shit management.,16
Next match of KXIP is against Rajasthan in Sharjah. Only Imagine those sixes from Sanju & KL ❤️,8
"Common boys that's comeback and a half, I say common boys",3
Bangalore should stick to IT industry,4
Rcb clearly need moeen and morris,8
WTF is this fielding?!,8
Two games in a row which justify Dhoni's shitty strategies to save nrr. I swear he has to be one if the luckiest people.,16
"""aaja bhai thodhi kam bezzati karwa dete hai """,3
Upvoting everything since 15 mins what fuck why's there a downvoter every fuckin day,7
I'm a pissed off RCB fan but downvoter get a life.,19
does RCB even win the Fair Play titles,10
CSK fair play huh,8
I can't fucking understand how the hell CSK is always at the top of fairplay award.,3
Umesh Yadav is Andre Russell without the batting and bowling.,8
I am telling you....rcb fans are the cringiest fan base ever,4
How is csk still at first after everything that happened between dhobi and the umpire last night?,4
I’m happy for KXIP but then I remember they’re playing us on Sunday 🙃,4
*poor run* pooran,4
"Imagine losing and still not becoming a meme.






**This comment was made by RCB**",8
OK we lost this match but at least I enjoyed watching KL rahul channel his inner Paul Valthaty today.,7
"We will have a bowl, thanks!

- Virat, 3 hours earlier!",3
What’s the reason for pooran over gayle?,8
Is the umpire sleeping lol..,3
Pooran is a compulsory associate nation player in IPL? 😂😭,3
Today has been a sombre day. Kudos to RCB for trying their best to lighten it up with a hilarious performance.,18
After Dhoni's argument with umpire how is csk top in fair play,12
"At this rate, RCB will force Vijay Malya to come back and kick their butt.

"CSK got full points? I'm sure Dhoni was the one asking for the third umpire then. But there were posts calling him a cheat. They forget he's the one who called back Ian Bell, they forget how many times CSK bagged the fair play award.",19
Good to see RCB restoring normalcy in 2020.,19
Downvoter is helping us get our comments to 'Most controversial',21
Wasn't it enough for Umesh to disappoint once with the ball that he had to go out the way he did?,17
Starting to understand why RCB is a meme,51
Today the batting has been worse than the bowling,23
I want cameraman to zoom in on Kumbles face,27

Getting all out will be sheer embarrassment. Hold down the fort George Washington.,13
Saini 1(1)  with a better strike rate than Sundar 24(25)  lol,5
Mujeeb can field better.,8
More like Royally fucked Challengers Bangalore amirite?,16
How is CSK top at Fairplay? Didn't Dhoni have some strict words with the Ump against us?,9

About halfway there lads it aint over yet! /s,1
Sundar not so sundar,3
sundar just chillin,4
"Complete shitshow today. Batting, bowling and fielding..",9
What happened to kohli..he looks thinner compared to before,8
Nooo. We reached 100. Looks like a glitch in the matrix.,7
"Sundar could have grind out a fifty here. The match is done for, might as well get some batting practice",8
Hesson asking ABD for tips. How he handles this shit every year,14
How can rcb have such a great batting lineup and still shit the bed like this. Maybe the people comparing the heat to rcb weren't that far off the mark.,10
BISHNOIIIIIIIIIIII... YOU ABSOLUTE BEAUTY!,4
What is the record for highest run defeat in IPL?,8
Emerging player of the tournament front runner  already,1
Did not think we would even get to 100,4
Now they just gonna send in a quickie next over and finish off the game,4
Bishnoi gets the Purple Cap.,5
Strategic timeout lol. Hahaha.,7
"**15.2** Ravi Bishnoi to Washington Sundar, OUT,  **101-8**

Washington Sundar c Agarwal b Ravi Bishnoi 30 (27b 2x4 1x6) SR: 111.11",5
Why tf do we need a timeout now...,10
Purple (Bishnoi) & Orange (KL) cap in same team. KXIP.,22
"Well, at least he scored 29 more runs than Koach. Can't blame him for trying something.",13
Wtf do you need strategic time out now for???,8
"good practie for sundar and special thanks to him for helping us cross 100

fuck i jixed it",6
anyone else rooting for delhi capitals? no? just me? okay,7
So KL's 132 itself is enough to beat RCB,5

?_?",9
"Of course, yet another ex-RCB Mayank Agarwal has to get involved as well.",6
That hair advert makes me ill,3
who is still watching the match?,3
Rcb look a bowler short while bowling and 2 batsmen short while batting,5
"Sundar is highest scorer today for RCB. 2020 is weird. Good effort dude.

Edit: added team name.",6
"It's one of those days where both teams fulfil their expectations ...

Kxip on how good they can be on their day, and RCB ..OH BOY Do i need to say anything.

Problem is doesn't matter how good RCB perform in second half of the tournament this loss and specially the margin is gonna hurt them bad.",3
"Still can't get my head around that Advanced Hair Studio ad with Warne and Gough. Awful, awful shit",1
RCB making sure to break KKR's record of loosing by most runs this season.,0
RCB now trying to chase K L Rahul's individual score.,5
What changes would you make to this rcb team?,5
Would it help if mayank played both sides now?,2
Come on RCB. You gotta cross KL score at least.,7
"I didn’t know much about KXIP going into this IPL, but they’ve quickly become the team to watch. The Delhi game was great, and this one…",6
all these games getting decided before the 10th over is just bad for the ipl.,6
"So, normalcy resumed this year?",6
Oof the IPL threads aren’t safe from the downvoter either,8
Lets see what king kohli says after the match,2
"Is serial downvoter an RCB fan who went full psycho after losing against one of those so-called ""shitty teams""?",8
You know you messed up when Sundar has the max runs for the team,9

Well played Sundar. At least we crossed 100.,4
Kohli is a brown cuck,-9
"We have a clown here, downvoting all the comments",1
I can somehow feel that Bishnoi gonna have hard time ahead... He bowls way too much googleys for leg spinner,2
"Guys , you’re forgetting that these timeouts only exist so they can pump in longer ads",6
Now Saini will do what Cummins did yesterday,4
"RCB trying to kill IPL revenue by getting out before 15th over. Can't let that happen 

*strategic timeout* after 8 wickets",5
last game sehwag was praising (in cricbuzz live) the heck out of dube and saini and now he's roasting them,3
Wow there is for sure a downvote bot unleashed on this thread.,2
Lmao! Some salty RCB fans downvoting every comment! Grow up losers!,3
Its hilarious how bad RCB are,8
"I was just watching Michael Clarke's 329 not out the other day back in Jan 2012. He would have got 400 had he not declared. He got around 200 of those runs off of Umesh Yadav. I am sat here wondering.. ""why is this guy still around and playing?""!",10
Kohli has a creepy smile,7
"I knew it Steyn, it was the headband all along",2
lads it's RCB,5
Not enough Kohli Cam™ for my liking,9
Shittiest ad? My pick is the Dailyhunt one,6
I feel bad for RCB fans. They deserve better than this. Thirteen fucking years of this shit plus the constant mockery is just too much.,9
"RCB is a gentle reminder that no matter how bad your team is, there's someone worse in the tournament.",5
What a terrible day all around for Kohli. Hope he comes back strong next game.,4
They should at least try to get as close to the total as possible so that the nrr doesn’t take a massive hit,1
"Rahul : ""yeah i think we had 50-60 more than required. Good effort by rcb""",9
"Kohli should relinquish the IPL captaincy and focus on helping the team with his amazing batting

"Ah yes of course, the strategic timeout lol",1
Kl rahul will win,5
Can ravi bishnoi get a 5-fer?,2

Just 30 runs behind,1
At least make rahuls score Ffs,4
"If Maxwell/Pooran get firing, KXIP will be very good",3
"SRH fans, how ashamed are you that you lost to RCB?",0
Two matches in a row which put credence in Dhoni's way of chasing big totals. Thala has done it again.,6
Saini can swing a few. Come on.,0
what more does umesh need to do to get dropped,8
"Forgetful season so far for Pooran. If Kumble has already made a big decision about Gayle, then should stick with it for a decent time. Pooran will bounce back💪",4
bishnoi >>>>>> chahal.,2
"I looked back on the cricinfo page and thought Maxwell got 3 wickets for a moment.  


Of course, I didn't freak out, because it's RCB",1
Saini freezes after playing the missed shot. Picture time,4
Imagine losing to RCB,-1
"Rcb back in form boiis, normalcy returning in 2020.",4
RCB always offloads unwanted players to KXIP so when is Kohli coming?,8
atleast we passed 100,3
"Umesh Yadav is like Debashis Mohanty with a longer career... (look him up, young'ns).",2
Morris in for Philippe and Siraj in for Umesh next game,-1
head band on Steyns suddenly Dinda,3
Saini's Intent™>Dhenier's Intent™,4
Tomorrow's match gonna be awesome. DC v CSK. Contenders vs Veterans ?,5
Steyn gon hit 57 runs which he conceded,1
Even 2020 cant fuck with RCB,7
"I think the RCB fans need not to realize that this game was well under control until the multiple dropped catches. The bowling isn’t terrible...*that* terrible , but as always the shit just doesn’t want to line up.",2
Lmao now I am started to think what would have happened with Indian team if Kohli and Kumble got alonged. You can see even in 18 yr old the plans are so evident on how to bowl.,3
Watching steyn bat after don't know how many years gives test match vibes,-2
Come on guys give the young man the 2 wickets,2
The real karnataka is winning here,2
"Rcb might need to win a game with same margin to which they are gonna lose today, question is whom they are gonna do it against ?",4
KXIP too good for RCB tonight,1
I'm glad that RCB had the CEAT tyres strategic time out to reevaluate their strategies and turn the game around in the next 4 overs.,7
RCB should bat first. **Always**!,4
"Drop phillipe and bring in Parthiv Patel.

Bring in morris in place of steyn and somehow try to play Moeen in the side",0
"Kohli for Williamson + Pandey + a bowler , what do y'all say ?",2
"Btw guys, Moeen Ali has an IPL career batting strike rate of 165 and economy rate of 6.97",2

"KL is good captaincy material, if he becomes permanent team member in international games , they should allow him to captain",6
"RCB haters mad about getting downvoted, GROW UP LOSERS",-14
Rahul just bring in Shami and Cottrell and end RCB's suffering 😂,1
RCB losing. Now everything is normal. Nature is healing.,9
Chad saini,5
Guys what do you think? If Rahul would have been caught first time would RCB had won? Or still same shitshow?,6
That's a good looking shot.,3
Came back to r/cricket and Reddit after some months only to see RCB be RCB. Feels very normal.,11
Gavaskar LMFAOOOOO,5
Anil Kumble laughing at RCB.. Lol,6
"hahahahaha, Om Muruga!",8
Kumble trolling hard,11
"How much did RCB pay for ABD + Kohli in total anyone know?

I wonder how they didnt buy some good backup overseas fast bowlers. Kane Richardson backing out really messed them up.",4
I still wonder what Kohli tells his batsmen during the break (after their bowlers get mauled). Would like to have an IPL version of The Test,6
Like 3rd or 4th wicket with the wrong one,3
why are teams still choosing to bowl first after winning the toss? not a great track record so far in the tournament.,5
This is embarrassing now,5
Shami was just like umesh but man has he evolved,13
Looks like they won't Beat KL,8
"**16.2** Ashwin to Saini, OUT,  **106-9**

Saini>Koach,3
the foolish drunk serial downvoter just downvoted the score update by the bot,9
NRR ki to lag gayi batti,4
Tfw Saini scored more than kohli,5
This is reminiscent of the first ever IPL game. RCB concede 200+ with an opener making a big hundred and then get bowled out cheaply.,8
I haven't seen Kumble this happy since he took 10fer against Pakistan.,10
RCB NRR is screwed,5
RR of RCB has been 6+ the whole match. MORAL VICTORY.,6
can’t believe RCB benched moeen and zampa for ... steyn,7

"All memes aside, what I love about the IPL is in every match, both teams are strong enough to win. It could be a close game or a thrashing, but the winner isn't a given before the game even starts. LEAGUE PARITY.",10
Even you can see Kumble having a laugh with Jordan if I was the coach I would have still angry at Jordan for that horrible last over 😂😭,9
"As a fan who is following him since 2016, Seeing Kohli being shit upon is really weird and kinda sad",8
Who the fuck is down voting comments?,4
Chahal be like oh come on I can finish this in an over..,8

Rahul can have a bowl now,4
"Just disband the fucking team man
It's embarassing for those of us who keep waiting for the matches. How can a team playing their 13thseason be so awful. Atleast have the balls to remove kohli from captaincy he's good for all fuck all..",14
"So, RCB will have a NRR of almost -2.50 right? and KIXP will have +2.5 according to my calculation.

EDIT: Sorry, Forgot that RCB played 2 matches.",3

Chahal looks like a baby in that gear,4
Commentator's curse has been in full effect today.,1
Less than 100 runs behind! Moral victory imo,3
I just want to see Chahal hit a six. Just once!,7
Chahal batting at 11 is a bad move. He should bat after De Villiers.,4
Redemption truly complete for kumble today.,5

These have been some beautiful wickets,7

"49*2+8, better",8
Bring on Shami. Ease RCB's pain.,3
KXIP is just distributing wickets now. Shami Cottrell Bishnoi tied at 4 wickets for the Purple Cap,9
Kohli is chill. He is ready with the answers for the post match conversation.,10
Lmao just hit me they have sent Chahal at 11 ? He bats higher even in India 11,8
RCB is finally back to default settings.  This the RCB we all know.,7
Steyn looks like the old grandpa who plays for his grand children,7

"""yeah we were a hundred runs, a couple catches, 3-4 wickets short""",10
"I think there is half a chance that Kohli might seriously consider changing teams if he were to get an offer from a team like DC or SRH.

Why DC? Home team man. Delhi boy playing for Delhi. He’d feel at home. Not saying RCB hasn’t made him comfortable tho. 

Why SRH? Cause of no pressure. No star player atmosphere. He’ll feel like there is a big weight lifted of his shoulders. VVS and Murali can sit with him to explain how this atmosphere would benefit him. He’ll be happy. 

Why no MI or CSK? I don’t they they’ll even make the offer frankly.

Edit: BTW this is just part of my fantasy so don’t take it seriously.",11

Finch is not a good player of spin and in a spin dominant IPL, Moeen should be brought for big hitting and bowling and he did well last year. Parthiv and Padikkal should open. Philip should be replaced by Morris for all round abilities. Umesh should be removed asap. Maybe try Udana for Steyn as he is not peak Steyn anymore.",6

I'm sure they'll achieve what they've been trying to achieve. They'll do it for sure. I'm sure that day will come, when they'll fill our heart with happiness by scoring something more embarrassing than 49/10. Good night.",78
