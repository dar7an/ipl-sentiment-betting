for example, 140 runs, kings 11 had KL holing out in the deep to kohli, he drops him instead (and for good measure drops another sitter the very next over)  and now i am sure kings 11 hit 200. and rcb lose bad, (watch kohli throw away his wicket), and after that watch rcb collapse  instead of getting on a roll.",-5

i think as long as RCB have kohli, they will never win a thing. the guy is poison for RCB.

Drags the team down and i know he is a class player but for RCB other than some useless 100s here n there, he never delivers when the stakes are high or come crunch time and messes up with everybodys confidence.

for example, 140 runs, kings 11 had KL holing out in the deep to kohli, he drops him instead (and for good measure drops another sitter the very next over) and now i am sure kings 11 hit 200. and rcb lose bad, (watch kohli throw away his wicket), and after that watch rcb collapse instead of getting on a roll.",1

Padikkal
Finch
Kohli
ABD
Dube
Udana
Sundar
Parthiv
Morris/Steyn
Saini
Chahal

Steyn will bowl his overs upfront and in middle and will play only till morris does not recover form injury. The death overs will be delivered by Saini, Udana and Morris once he returns. Parthiv will play as a specialist keeper who will only bat once a while like 2-3 times in whole tournament. Also the team will have batting till 9 once Morris returns. Kohli also have to be smart in using Sundar's 4 overs and you will have a pretty decent attack and also batting.",1

I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen hair serums in his hands without paying.

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

When she took one of the cream and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each cream and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.

Why SRH? Cause of no pressure. No star player atmosphere. He’ll feel like there is a big weight lifted of his shoulders. VVS and Murali can sit with him to explain how this atmosphere would benefit him. He’ll be happy.
