It's management is utter shite. \n\nVisited for the semi, dear god, the seats are uncomfortable and often dirty. They sell seats with blocked views with no prior notification. The volume of stuff you can't bring in is atrocious but more than that the behaviour of the staff - geez. They make you walk a country mile before you can enter, the food stalls hardly leave you any space to walk, the toilets are not worth entering, I can go on and on and on...\n\nKolkata is a beautiful city. Bengalis are warm and hospitable. They love their cricket. They live this game. They'd know more about Aussie players than half our population. \n\nThey deserve better than what Bengal Cricket does for them and what BCCI does for them. Eden Gardens is iconic yes, but an absolute mess, sorry.",

Reacts quick enough and snaffles it sharply to his right, one-handed.

And the acceleration doesn't happen.\n\nIt's what turned out in the WC'23 final. Kohli and Rahul stabilised and took their merry time. The minute Kohli reached 50, he was going to 2nd gear and beyond in all games - and in the final, Cummins got himself on the over after Kohli got 50.\n\nHe got Kohli in that over, and India struggled to make it to 250, atleast 70 behind what they needed.",
