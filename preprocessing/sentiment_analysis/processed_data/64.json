In fact, no one does but KL is such a down to earth bloke who's always looking to learn, he's willing to do anything for the team. He might not be the absolute best but he's a very decent captain and player and has got LSG to 2 playoffs when they don't necessarily have as balanced a team as so many other franchises and so many of their big players blowing hot and cold. Goenka pulled this shit for RPSG also when he sacked MSD as captain who went in on to win 3 IPL trophies after that. You can definitely demand performance from your marquee captain, but not like that, not by humiliating him in public",

I also wonder, given their PP woes, if they can have a slogger be a floating opener for the next season like Narine. Arshad can clearly slog and the pitches aren't gonna get any bowler friendly next season. Their terrible powerplays have sunk them this season.",
