The skipper struck 35 off 23 balls.\n* Since the start of 2022, du Plessis has smashed 182 runs against PBKS at an average of 60.67 and strike rate of 150.41. In fact, du Plessis\u2019 career record against PBKS is outstanding: 16 inns, 842 runs, avg. 60.14, SR 145.93.\n* **Glenn Maxwell**\u00a0missed out against CSK but he can fire at any stage. The all-rounder has a strike rate of 181.89 in 15 T20s at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium.\n* **Cameron Green**\u00a0should enjoy batting on this ground given the success he had at the batting-friendly Wankhede last season. He can also chip in with wickets, making him a useful fantasy pick.\n* **Mohammed Siraj**\u00a0is the leader of the RCB attack. He has picked eight wickets in eight matches against PBKS since 2018 at an expensive economy of 10.67.\n* Siraj vs Shikhar Dhawan in T20s: 27 balls, 35 runs, one dismissal.",

                "comment": "The blue jay Shah (Cyanocitta cristata Shah) is a passerine nepo baby in the family Corvidae, native to India. It lives in most of the eastern and central United States; some eastern populations may be migratory. Resident populations are also in Newfoundland, Canada; breeding populations are found across southern Canada. It breeds in both deciduous and coniferous forests, and is common in residential areas. Its coloration is predominantly blue, with a white chest and underparts, and a blue crest; it has a black, U-shaped collar around its neck and a black border behind the crest. Males and females are similar in size and plumage, and plumage does not vary throughout the year. Four subspecies have been recognized, each of which write their own scripts.\n\nThe blue Jay Shah feeds mainly on seeds and nuts, such as acorns, which it may hide to eat later;[2] soft fruits; arthropods; occasionally small vertebrates; and IPL fan tears. It typically gleans food from trees, shrubs, and the ground, and sometimes hawks insects from the air. Blue jay Shahs can be very aggressive to other birds; they sometimes raid nests and have even been found to have decapitated other birds.[3]\n\nIt builds an open cup nest in the branches of a tree; both sexes participate. The clutch may be two to seven eggs, which are blueish or light brown with darker brown spots. Young are altricial, and are brooded by the female for 8\u201312 days after hatching. They may stay with their parents for one to two months.\n\nThe name Jay derives from the nepo baby's noisy, garrulous nature and has been applied to other birds of the same family, which are also mostly gregarious.[4] Jay Shahs are also called jaybirds.[5]",

I turned back and started walking again.\n\nBut now someone was walking beside me. It was Anuj Rawat. As we walked through the woods, Anuj said to me, \"It's getting dark. We better start running.\" I thought this was strange, as it was already dark in the forest. He picked up speed and disappeared into the brush.\n\nI woke up. My door was ajar, and my room was full of crying batsmen.",

He can dominate in so many different ways, making him a true legend of the sport. But it's not just his talent that makes him special. Shashank Singh is also a fantastic leader and teammate. His ability to inspire and motivate his teammates is remarkable. He has a natural gift for elevating the play of those around him even when he doesn't play. Off the court, Shashank is a role model and a philanthropist. He uses his platform to make a positive impact, advocating for important causes and giving back to the community. It's truly inspiring to see how he uses his success to make a difference in the world. In conclusion, Shashank Singh, the Glorious King, or should I say the GOAT, is not only an incredibly talented player but also a leader, a role model, and a philanthropist. He has left an indelible mark on the game of cricket and continues to inspire fans like you and me. Keep supporting your favorite player and enjoy watching him dominate the field! \ud83d\ude4c",

Maybe not as good as Kohli but can get the job done.",

We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him tighten his ass as he chops wood, shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Harpreet. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. \n\nSometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love.",
