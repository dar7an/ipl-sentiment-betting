Some aberations here, traditionally teams that have batted first have succeeded but not this season. Spinners haven't had a significant part in this season either as has been the case previously. It looks very dry, there's a mosaic underlay and there isn't really a sheen that you have come to expect in this year's IPL. Same surface that was used in that game against GT where CSK scored over 200 runs. This pitch produces the greatest degree of turn, 2.4 degrees as compared 1,8 degrees compared to the other pitches. Still think there will be some assistance for the spinners and for those who can bowl slower delivers but there's still runs on the board. Might just want to have couple of extra overs of spin up your sleeve. There might be significant dew later in the evening\" say Anjum Chopra and Samuel Badree",

Can't expect him to hit every game , wont be surprised if he goes off early today , Gaikwad and Rahane need to step up their game , especially Rahane , he has to go crazy in that first 6 overs and don't care about his wicket - If Moeen Ali is playing , he can also play a quickfire innings. Don't see CSK winning (if they bat first) AND if they don't follow a certain plan to attack\n\nIf CSK bat second , none of these will matter as I think (controversial opinion) that CSK bowlers will get quick wickets and get them to a below 180-190 score , but still CSK may take it a little deeper than required.",

I feel like his body never recovered after playing that exhausting Gabba test which is the reason why we couldn't have this excellent yorker bowling man in our long term scheme of things.\n\nEdit: same issue is with Varun Chakkarvarthy",

We need someone who can perform like Jaiswal, Gaikwad, Abhishek, etc. It's not like there's a scarcity of openers in India. A Goat captain may or may not win you matches but a performing players surely will. We need performing openers and not a captain who needs carryjob.",

This was the original purpose of the rule anyway, to give more young Indian players some game time. \n\n- minimum 75 meter boundaries. \n\n- hire independent international pitch consultants to eliminate any biases from regional curators or BCCI. \n\n- LBW decision orientation changes if a batter switches stance.",

Walks into bat in the 20th over with 4-5 balls to spare, swings wildly at everything that appears like a white ball, tonks a couple of 4s and 6s in this process. The crowd goes wild and dance up & down. Broadcaster goes absolutely nuts. Rinse and repeat for 6-8 weeks and goes back to his hut relaxing.",

The moment arrives at the last over. Well set batter gets out with 1 ball requiring 6 runs to win, out comes thala for one last time. Everything fell into place for this exact moment. An aged lion coming out one more time for his last roar. Full length ball, Dhoni slaps it over mid wicket for a six as he holds the pose and twirls the bat in hand with Ravi Shastri on comms. *Dhoni finishes off in style\u2026.*           I\u2019m going to be dreaming this every night till it happens. The final saga.",

Cummins himself admitted this approach wouldn't always work. It might hold more weight in the groups but they're going to have to significantly tweak this style of play once they reach the knockouts, because I don't see them winning a title like this.\n\nAs for this match, I can only see a moment of individual brilliance from both or either Klaasen or Samad saving SRH.",

This strategy is starting to annoy me, they're too dependent on the openers performing and yet again the top order, esp Head and Abhishek threw it away when we were on par with the RRR. It's terrible because it puts too much pressure on these dudes and when they actually have to go, they can't bc it's too risky. Absolutely nothing is connecting and it's fuckin slipping away cus the gap is widening. 107 in 15 overs is fucking abysmal. What the fuck are they doing?\u00a0",
