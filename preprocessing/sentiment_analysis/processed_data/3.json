Just because he failed in the final and India lost, he's not as hyped. People only remember him for being bad at facing the short ball or always being injured.",

Will the designated #11 batter walk out or does the innings end there. \n\nExample: DC replaced Ricky Bhui with Abhi Porel in the same innings. Now should DC have lost 10 wickets (ideally the innings would end) but then the designated #11 of DC who's still remaining wouldn't get to bat. What happens at this stage? This seems like a loophole in the rule.",

Good Field Placements, Top Notch Fielding some good bowling..\n\nBut that freak of an innings from DreRusss... Undid everything...\n\nThe things maybe we could improve on is maybe Jensen and Bhuvi hitting those Yorkers...  16th over spinner experiment definately didn't work out... But can't blame bowlers too much today...\n\n\nHopefully we bat like we fielded today.....",
