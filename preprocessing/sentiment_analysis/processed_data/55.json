I mean, dude you know the club will fuck with you regardless of history, they're doing it to your national captain. Why not just think of yourself for a bit? Tell them you're not interested in retention, go into auction, make millions. \n\nIt would be really cool to see where he ends up. Maybe RCB as the next captain? Maybe even PBKS? So many teams will be looking for a captain and would love to strengthen their bowling. I daresay Pant's captaincy has been a little lacking this year, and he will not have a problem giving it up to Bumrah to get him in the team. The possibilities are really exciting. Bumrah at MI has gotten so stale and let's face it, he should've been captain this year. 100%.",

A true IPL fraud who has never been consistent in this tournament since the start , had only good seasons in 2020 and 2021 , still couldn't help KXIP /PBKS qualify for playoffs then. Him and Deepak Hooda really have some black magical powers to be constantly picked up by franchises despite hardly performing.",

There's no one quite reliable like with teams like RR and KKR (who recover even after they have 5 down) and that sorta sucks, the amount of collapses in the last 5 games hasn't been pretty, it's sad how inconsistent the batting is and it also feels like everyone depends on the other to perform and show no initiative to asses the situation and play accordingly to dig the team out of the hole (esp disappointing when Klassen does this).   \n  \nSomething feels off and I think that's going to be the difference when it comes to why we're probably not winning this season compared to the top 2. Those 2 bad losses rly felt like they messed with the batting and it hasn't been the same since even, the mojo esp with the opening pair has been lost, and the holes are really starting to show. Today would've been a good day to bring in Glenn Philips.",

Our batting is just the so unreliable, and it sucks that Klassen never seems to deliver when we actually need it either. F  \n  \nFor a team that's supposed to be known for its batting, I get insanely nervous after we're about two down, exactly because of what's happening now, and that's not a good feeling esp when you compare it with the batting depth teams like RR and KKR. The collapses in the last 4-5 games have been very concerning, it never feels even remotely safe after 3 wickets fall. We need actual match-winners. I'm also not very confident with Abhi and Head as a pair anymore, feels like those 2 bad games killed the mojo and firepower of that pair.",

In fact, he believes that Piyush is the greatest part-time cricketer, full time mithai salesman India has ever produced. He said he didn't take Chawla to the WC because his potbelly six-hitting power would end all competition if he played, and he expected Chawla to break all the records of Sachin and Dravid combined when it's deemed fair to select him.\n\nSource: BCCI Source",

Our batting during those chases were terrible, but those losses have absolutely rattled this team and now they can't even deliver when we're batting first? I know it's normal to have off days but it's been about 5 games since the 287. Even teams like KKR and RR have off days but someone always steps up and it never seems to last for more than one game. SRH legit feels like they've been broken open.\n\nPat should promote himself to the middle order tbh. Feels like a way more reliable anchor at this point than anyone who comes in after number 4.",

If he can do this himself without any support, he'd be even better coming in earlier and supporting whoever else is on the crease, even from a morale standpoint, his calming presence could be huge for the other batter. Idk, it sorta makes so much more sense to do this if we want to steer back the game after a collapse rather than saving him for number 9 when he has no proper support.",

                "comment": "Too many holes in this SRH team tbh. It feels like we were winning despite them, the way the cracks have shown in the last few games is kinda sad. Our inability to capitalize on multiple early wickets needs some serious thought, just one person who can carry us during those middle overs would be so good. The lack of spin is sorta mind boggling",
