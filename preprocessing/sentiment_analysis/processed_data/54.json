Bowled so well against Pak in 2022 Asia Cup, only for Arshdeep to drop a sitter off him, at the death that too. \n\nRinku and Bishnoi have been worst done by the selection panel which at times says that 'IPL performances aren't influential' but clearly it's otherwise.",

Line and length was their main strength and it has zero reward in the current format. \n\n140 around bowlers are still able to trouble batters with yorkers and wide line bowls. How successful they are is a different question but pace still has some say in the game but mid pace bowlers I don\u2019t think will last longer with the current impact player strategy.\n\nYes there are all rounders effected due to team selection issues but this is also an area of concern which is not highlighted till now I guess",
