We're seeing so many times that the bowler runs in but the batter isn't ready, the batter isn't even looking. And then the bowler has to go back. This is the responsibility of the umpire, to make the bowler know that the batter isn't ready yet, by extending one of the arms. The umpire can also ask the batter to move on with it if needed. But unless the batter is ready, the umpire has to keep their arm extended so that the bowler knows. This is one of the first things we're taught in umpiring. (I haven't taken a course, but played for a club when I was little and umpired in a few club games).",

(Genuinely nice over)\n\n8th over - got some confidence because of previous over decided to bowl again when 1 batsmen got out in 7th over (so probably another easy over still conceded 10 runs)\n\n12th over- Average bowling (conceded 11 runs)\n\n19th over- Returns when only bowlers are left and all the batsmen are gone (gets a wicket ) (tonked for a 6 by rabada) (gave 11 runs in total when 2 tail enders were on crease)\n\nOverall- 4 over 33 runs 1 wicket \n\nLooks nice over all and he regains some confidence \n\nNext match vs rr- Gives himself the first over thinking he bowled good last match is regaining his form etc etc (11 runs conceded ) and not seen again in the powerplay.",

It was also evident in the way Nabi reposted a story on Instagram questioning MI management's decision to not bowl him and bat him lower in the order.

He could have achieved so much more at GT and probably could have gone down as one of the legends of the cricket and would have easily ended up as a captain to ICT as well.\n\nBut he had to go back to daddy Ambani and show off his shit attitude to his teammates.
