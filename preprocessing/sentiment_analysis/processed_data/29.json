From behind, top, front, side-on angle, cover, deep mid-wicket, all the hits, all the big ones, all the good ones. Then he reviews again. He\u2019s out busting wide calls. Then he\u2019s back to the director for some more full UltraEdge^(TM) coverage. Reviews wide, back to the director, full UltraEdge^(TM) coverage. Review, UltraEdge^(TM), review, full UltraEdge^(TM) coverage, review, UltraEdge^(TM). And this goes on and on, and back and forth, for 250 or so minutes until the match just, sort of, ends.",

In the first review, Daryl was already standing slightly outside off but the umpire called it his normal stance and gave the marginal call as wide. How are these things defined? Shouldn't it be properly measured if we're going to the third umpire rather than eye balling things? Like how they've clearly defined height no balls by taking the data of height of players. Even height wide balls are done by eye balling. That's crazy.",

Taking a regular bowler like Shreyas Gopal out of the attack after just 1 over and not letting him bowl more just cos of that one over. Having bits and pieces bowlers to cover for him.\u00a0\n\n\n2. Not using your best bowler at the beginning of the innings.\n\n\n3. Pandya's terrible line and length in the final over esp to Dhoni. Some of those balls that he launched into the orbit were gifts.\n\n\n4. Overall being very rigid and not flexible enough to change plans according to the situation of the game.",

This guy knows his strengths and weaknesses to the core and he speaks about them straight to the the management of the time - \n1. Make a place in Indian team with a new brand of aggressive cricket - played at 3 and smashed people\n2. Running the risk of getting discovered, changed roles and came down playing the anchor and saviour from collapses, wining it for the team with a calm head\n3. Quit formats when they were not fit for him, didn\u2019t hang around to be questioned about approach and strike rates \n4. Build CSK over years finishing games for them \n5. Stayed relevant by mind while he knew 5th/6th batting is not his place - comes around with minimum expectations, allows him to perform and gets back to strategising \n\nThe guy is the perfect example how one should always know one self and change/adapt with time to create legacies",

That approach is great in ODIs to not throw wicket but basically you will never ever see a higher than 150 SR. On the other Brohit has massive six hitting power. You know he can be 20 (16) and hit two sixes and be 32(18) which is over 170 SR. Plus Rohit doesn't check himself when he's striking. He doesn't have the need to run a single after hitting a boundary.",

I didn't even liked cricket but my heart was pounding after witnessing this shot. Felt something poking down when I checked it was a huge fckin boner, ashamed I looked around when I saw this girl, she had the same horny expression, our eyes met and it took us hardly any long before we were making out in the back of my car, we drove home ,she pulled me towards the kitchen while the TV was running in the bg, with every shot we became more and more intimate and climaxed when Kishan hit a helicopter shot out of the boundary. After experimenting some more we found that pre-recorded innings didn't work 'that' well,We are most intimate when Kishan is playing live and God knows what will happen if he bats for the whole inning.",

I didn't even liked cricket but my heart was pounding after witnessing this shot. Felt something poking down when I checked it was a huge fckin boner, ashamed I looked around when I saw this girl, she had the same horny expression, our eyes met and it took us hardly any long before we were making out in the back of my car, we drove home ,she pulled me towards the kitchen while the TV was running in the bg, with every shot we became more and more intimate and climaxed when Kishan hit a helicopter shot out of the boundary. After experimenting some more we found that pre-recorded innings didn't work 'that' well,We are most intimate when Kishan is playing live and God knows what will happen if he bats for the whole inning.",

A short pitched delivery onto the body, Pandya takes it on with the pull but holes out to deep mid-wicket. Never got going today, timing all off for the MI skipper. Clever tactics from CSK, using Deshpande with the longer leg side boundary. Knew MI would come hard at them this over. \"",
