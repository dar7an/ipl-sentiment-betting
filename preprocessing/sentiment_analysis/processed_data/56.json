Marcus Stoinis was allegedly heard calling Adam Zampa from the team's underground bunker, asking tearfully \"Is there anything I can do?\"",

There was no bat involved, as the ball struck his back pad. And replays show the ball would have, surprisingly, hit middle stump, and not leg!\n\nTristan Stubbs lbw b Sandeep Sharma 41 (20b 3x4 3x6) SR: 205",

But, resisting change never works.\n\nThe change we see in T20I cricket has happened earlier as when we saw the move from Tests to ODI. Even within ODI, going from 60 overs to 50 overs, then the first 15 over fielding restrictions, Jaysurya making great use of that, etc etc.\n\nWhile test cricket is a beautiful thing, ODI democratized cricket more and T20 more so. More smaller countries are slowly becoming prominent. I know, painfully slowly, perhaps, but still better than nothing.\n\nThe good balls of yester-years may not always be good balls today, based on the pitch. But new good balls will emerge\u2026\nI\u2019m excited to see how the new phase emerges.",
