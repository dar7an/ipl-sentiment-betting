He is almost 30, Rishabh Pant is back, KL proved he can be a limited over WK, and ofcourse Jurel is younger and in path to become an all format player. \n\nSamson has nothing to lose anymore. No pressure. No overthinking",

They viewed his coaching as the cry of discontentedness with the neoliberal consensus, and a legitimate philosophical work in it\u2019s own right.\n\nThe modern Hegelians saw Langerism as the dialectical synthesis between two states of being, that of anguish and that of ennui.\n\nThose using the works of Plato are conflicted on whether to see Langer as a concrete object, real and tangible, while all consider the feelings the games elicit to be abstract.\n\nOthers saw him as post-modern performance art and tried to categorise him as the intended catalyst of a yet to materialise Neo-Fluxus movement.\n\nAlas, others even ascribed him a theological value, arguing for the canonisation of Langer and compared our pain listening to his commentary to the pain our lord felt on the cross. A contingent of these worshippers split recently and alleged Langer was inherently heretical, no mortal man had ever suffered like Jesus did until we saw his LinkedIn profile.\n\nThe truth is, Langer defies what the human mind is capable of interpreting.\n\nWe can only bask in his majesty.",

I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry.\n\n\nSometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing.\n\n\nOne day one of us will die, and the other will bury the other outside the log cabin.\n\n\nThen that person will go inside, pen a brief missive to that departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love.",

I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Paddikal. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then they'll go inside, pen a brief missive to their departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without their one true platonic love.",

The once proud tradition of the batsman valuing his wicket above all else has been abandoned in the modern era of T20 cricket.\n\n\nGone are the days of digging in and fighting for every run, of respecting the bowler and the game. Now it's all about swing for the fences and hope for the best. Wickets are nothing more than disposable assets, traded away for a few quick runs and a fleeting moment of glory.\n\n\nAs an LSG fan and a general fan of batting, it breaks my heart to see the importance of my wicket diminish before my eyes. It used to be that a batsman's value was measured by his ability to stay at the crease, to weather the storm and lead his team to victory. But now, it seems that all anyone cares about is how many sixes you can hit in a row.\n\n\nWhere is the skill in that? Where is the artistry? I fear that in this new world of cricket as a LSG fan , the true value of the game has been lost. We must return to our roots, to the fundamental principles of cricket, if we are to preserve the sport we love. The wicket must once again be held sacred, a symbol of our dedication to the game and the team.\n\n\nUntil that day comes, I will continue to fight for every run, to protect my wicket at all costs. For I know that while the game may have changed, the true spirit of cricket will always remain.",
