Accelerate, if you have wickets in hand.\n\nDont play for your ORANGE CAP. You clearly always do, and it costs the team.\n\nIt's not all your fault, you have been the best player for LSG this season. But don't take the responsibiltiy of LSG on your shoulders. Because if you do, it just doesn't work. Especially in T20s, one guy can't win you games. You need to trust that the middle and lower order will do well. 3 quick fire 30s > 1 ORANGE CAP.\n\nI don't think LSG will start winning games, if you take more risk and potentially get out. There are other big issues with the team and management. But atleast people will stop blaming you. Let the rest of the batters get a chance to do their job, if they fail, it's on them.\n\n/s",

He must be starting to feel pretty nervous about losing his first choice spot in the Indian test team with all the young batters India have coming through at the moment, so it makes sense that he's playing this way now to show off his test credentials. \n\nHe shouldn't need to worry however, his status as a big name in Indian cricket and his staggering test average of 34 should see him selected over much more deserving players",
