Players must think of money in a league created to make money.",

Looks like Bishnoi has gotten his man. Tilak is just short of his ground, and that is a superb bit of fielding.

Accelerate, if you have wickets in hand.\n\nDont play for your 100. You clearly always do, and it costs the team.\n\nIt's not all your fault, you have been the best player for MI this season. But don't take the responsibiltiy of MI on your shoulders. Because if you do, it just doesn't work. Especially in T20s, one guy can't win you games. You need to trust that the middle and lower order will do well. 3 quick fire 30s > 1 medium paced 100.\n\nI don't think MI will start winning games, if you take more risk and potentially get out. There are other big issues with the team and management. But atleast people will stop blaming you. Let the rest of the batters get a chance to do their job, if they fail, it's on them.\n\n/s",

Accelerate, if you have wickets in hand.\n\nDont play for your 100. You clearly always do, and it costs the team.\n\nIt's not all your fault, you have been the best player for MI this season. But don't take the responsibiltiy of MI on your shoulders. Because if you do, it just doesn't work. Especially in T20s, one guy can't win you games. You need to trust that the middle and lower order will do well. 3 quick fire 30s > 1 medium paced 100.\n\nI don't think MI will start winning games, if you take more risk and potentially get out. There are other big issues with the team and management. But atleast people will stop blaming you. Let the rest of the batters get a chance to do their job, if they fail, it's on them.\n\n/s",

But here Livingston showed maturity, something which sky can't do. Livi can strike at 250 and can also bat with awareness. Sky can only do the former.",

Just look how they let go of Tristan Stubbs after 2022 season n he fits so good in DC middle order.\n\nThey let go of Boult and he's still as good in powerplay.\n\nThey are so good at finding and training local young talent but go all in on players like Ishan or Green in auction. Instead they could have bought Stubbs/QdK/Klassen/Pooran and would have spare money to buy good bowlers.\n\nPlus SKY should open at non strikers end. Ishan or Rohit are both good fit in middle order and the best batter should get to play maximum balls.\n\nAlso they should switch around bowling squad if it is not working. All these matches lost and still Arjun/Kumar Karthikeya/Anshul Kamboj are warming the bench.\n\nThe season is done for MI anyways.",

So sometimes even if you take rahane into t20 he could smack too if he's in form like it happened last year. Like.kohli in 2016 so basically if indian teams turns out to be in some form there might be chance you never know. You take the best 11 Ever but even if they are Outta form you ain't winning against weakest 11 in form. Calm down guys",

Accelerate, if you have wickets in hand.\n\nDont play for your 100. You clearly always do, and it costs the team.\n\nIt's not all your fault, you have been the best player for MI this season. But don't take the responsibiltiy of MI on your shoulders. Because if you do, it just doesn't work. Especially in T20s, one guy can't win you games. You need to trust that the middle and lower order will do well. 3 quick fire 30s > 1 medium paced 100.\n\nI don't think MI will start winning games, if you take more risk and potentially get out. There are other big issues with the team and management. But atleast people will stop blaming you. Let the rest of the batters get a chance to do their job, if they fail, it's on them.\n\n/s",

Accelerate, if you have wickets in hand.\n\nDont play for your 100. You clearly always do, and it costs the team.\n\nIt's not all your fault, you have been the best player for MI this season. But don't take the responsibiltiy of MI on your shoulders. Because if you do, it just doesn't work. Especially in T20s, one guy can't win you games. You need to trust that the middle and lower order will do well. 3 quick fire 30s > 1 medium paced 100.\n\nI don't think MI will start winning games, if you take more risk and potentially get out. There are other big issues with the team and management. But atleast people will stop blaming you. Let the rest of the batters get a chance to do their job, if they fail, it's on them.\n\n/s",

Accelerate, if you have wickets in hand.\n\nDont play for your 100. You clearly always do, and it costs the team.\n\nIt's not all your fault, you have been the best player for LSG this season. But don't take the responsibiltiy of LSG on your shoulders. Because if you do, it just doesn't work. Especially in T20s, one guy can't win you games. You need to trust that the middle and lower order will do well. 3 quick fire 30s > 1 medium paced 100.\n\nI don't think LSG will start winning games, if you take more risk and potentially get out. There are other big issues with the team and management. But atleast people will stop blaming you. Let the rest of the batters get a chance to do their job, if they fail, it's on them.\n\n/s",

Accelerate, if you have wickets in hand.\n\nDont play for your ORANGE CAP. You clearly always do, and it costs the team.\n\nIt's not all your fault, you have been the best player for LSG this season. But don't take the responsibiltiy of LSG on your shoulders. Because if you do, it just doesn't work. Especially in T20s, one guy can't win you games. You need to trust that the middle and lower order will do well. 3 quick fire 30s > 1 ORANGE CAP.\n\nI don't think LSG will start winning games, if you take more risk and potentially get out. There are other big issues with the team and management. But atleast people will stop blaming you. Let the rest of the batters get a chance to do their job, if they fail, it's on them.\n\n/s",

The ancient Egyptians carved them on their tombs and the Hoodas are mentioned in the Iliad, the Mahabharata, the Bible and Quran. Swarms have devastated crops and have caused famines and human migrations. More recently, changes in agricultural practices and better surveillance of Deepak Hooda breeding grounds have allowed control measures at an early stage. Traditional Hooda control uses Krunal Pandya from the ground or air, but newer biological control methods are proving effective. Swarming behaviour decreased in the 20th century, but despite modern surveillance and control methods, swarms can still form; when suitable weather conditions occur and vigilance lapses, plagues can occur.",

We have done so even after many players failing is a positive, but even that's stretching things a bit. I guess even in the 2022 season where we ended up last on the table didn't hurt as much as it did this year",
