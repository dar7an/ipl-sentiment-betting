Virat get's to bat twice but left handed the second time.\n\n4. Sunil Narine can chuck\n\n5. If MSD walks out to bat in the last over the game is now 21 overs.\n\n6. Chest high bumpers are a no ball for Shreyas Iyer.\n\n7. SKY can only hit 120 degrees in front of the wicket\n\n8. Crowd catches count as out for Mo Siraj\n\nAnd so on",

Technically the batter left the field on their own accord so they're out without the fielding team getting them out. What this does is it incentivises this form of strategy and takes out a bit of  taboo of walking off. The batter preserves the average and the team can get in a better batter.Win win for everyone.",

Dube played great at 3 or 4 before so what do they do? Bring him down to 5/6. Meanwhile the top is pumped full of batters that can't hit a ball or out of form like Rahane, Mitchell and Jadeja. I mean I get Rahane, but Jadeja just should not be sucking out the momentum at 4.",

The Kohli type innings are far superior since they prove that you can survive for longer while still scoring the same amount of runs which is exactly what you want from a batter to take the shine off the ball and tire out opponent pacers. We need Kohli to play in T20 WC to break more individual records which are the only things that really matter, since we anyway gave up on ICC trophies. Rohit and Siraj make perfect sense too!",

Dube might still not be seen as bankable against the Pakistan pacers, but there's high chance that he will take down bowling attacks of Ireland, Canada, and USA.\n\nAnd apart from those sureshot Ws, it'll just be a bonus if je does go well against Pakistan & the 2nd round teams. By that time, if he has consistently fired, he will have that confidence & momentum needed to possibly tear down better attacks.\n\nI think Dube should be in that 15.",

He has shown strong temperament and match awareness for RR and has been excellent so far for the franchise\n\n\nPant is Pant - favourite of players, selectors, coaches and ex players.

If you build a risk profile, I think letting them be in for about 20 balls is ideal. Then, get them out. It's ok, just like the stock market, you don't want to hold for too long and be stuck with bags on the way down. Take the profits of a struggling batter after 20 balls. It's 1/6 of the innings, gone. Paddikal has effectively killed the game for LSG here. 14 off 20 can become 20 off 29, yes, but it can also become 35 off 25 and then you get accused of \"bringing him into form\" and shit. This was the absolute right time to dismiss paddikal and CSK damn near nailed it in my opinion.",

Wide line is an indicator and the guide for wide is of batsman can reach the ball in normal stance. There is no way Stoinis had a chance in hell to play that ball expect with his bottom edge. But umpires are fucking stupid robots. Not sure many of them even know what wide means and why it is there.",
