He'll turn up when it matters, but that'll be hard to do if he's not getting game time before the knock outs.\n\nHe can still contribute with the bat, and they've been winning anyway. \n\nHasn't even been bowling as bad as people say anyway. Some of the balls they've hit him for 6 on have not deserved it. Such is the nature of bowling the final over of t20s.",

Wt20 2022 is an example. The ball was swinging and seaming like crazy. I think they have been instructed to change that, and they have overcompensated, and have introduced a ball that does absolutely nothing, and scores have gone up, which I suspect was the aim.",

Accelerate, if you have wickets in hand.\n\nDont play for your 100. You clearly always do, and it costs the team.\n\nIt's not all your fault, you have been the best player for KKR this season. But don't take the responsibiltiy of KKR on your shoulders. Because if you do, it just doesn't work. Especially in T20s, one guy can't win you games. You need to trust that the middle and lower order will do well. 3 quick fire 30s > 1 medium paced 100.\n\nI don't think KKR will start winning games, if you take more risk and potentially get out. There are other big issues with the team and management. But atleast people will stop blaming you. Let the rest of the batters get a chance to do their job, if they fail, it's on them.\n\n/s",

Hope to see this in the next season.\n\n\n1) Push out boundaries almost to the edge of the actual ground, give a meter or two for media/cameramen. Fuck the sponsors, we have ads, electronic boards, strategic timeouts, etc. for that shit.\n\n\nPushing out boundaries will also bring more outfielders into the game.\n\n\n2) Name your impact sub before the game. All rounders will be back in contention. Better, get rid of it completely.\u00a0\n\n\n3) Remove the toss. Let the away team choose to bat or bowl. Controversial, I agree. But home team will have an excuse to 'doctor' pitches which will suit their team.\n\n\n4) Bonus points if a team reaches a target within specified number of overs or a team wins by certain amount of runs. You want an exciting game/tournament where even now dead rubbers could be an important game.",

The parathas are high in calories as they have a lot of butter in them. But this can cause Paratha phenomenon. It is a rare human condition where you start secreting butter from your fingers. This is the reason why Punjab bowlers cant bowl or fielders can't field. Incidentally RCB players also had this issue because of their heavy intake of butter Dosa.",

Accelerate, if you have wickets in hand.\n\nDont play for your 100. You clearly always do, and it costs the team.\n\nIt's not all your fault, you have been the best player for KKR this season. But don't take the responsibiltiy of KKR on your shoulders. Because if you do, it just doesn't work. Especially in T20s, one guy can't win you games. You need to trust that the middle and lower order will do well. 3 quick fire 30s > 1 medium paced 100.\n\nI don't think KKR will start winning games, if you take more risk and potentially get out. There are other big issues with the team and management. But atleast people will stop blaming you. Let the rest of the batters get a chance to do their job, if they fail, it's on them.\n\n/s",

I'm sure their is some influence of the home teams on what kind of a pitch they like.\n\nEveryone knows Eden Gardens, Chinnaswamy & Wankhede are flat wickets, but this year even Heydrabad & Chennai have been flat. \n\nAnd except for bowlers, no captain or coach has talked about having problem with pitches. Yes there is some influence of Impact players, but in most matches where these ridiculous scores have been scored..the teams haven't even used it while batting",
