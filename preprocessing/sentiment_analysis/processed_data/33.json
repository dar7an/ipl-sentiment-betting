Miss your length by an inch and it's a slot ball getting smashed or a full toss that's easy to deposit.",

IPL really needs to look to make fast pitches with seam movement early on in the season. That will bring the bowlers in the game without the UAE type cricket we get to see often later on in the season.",

Bumrah is infinitely more valuable in the middle and the death; since Mumbai's other bowlers are leagues below him, they could use the assistance of the new ball in the early overs more than him. That's why he usually gets an over in the back end of the powerplay.",

He bowled good, he has an economy of 7.3, he didn't waste a lot of bowls with bat too, did what the situation demanded when he knew he had players to hit. The bowling change to bring in Bumrah and Coetzee changed the game here, in these 2 overs, only 5 runs were scored with 1 important wicket of Ashutosh. Criticize where it's due, credits where it's due is good, but criticise when you do good is abysmal.",
