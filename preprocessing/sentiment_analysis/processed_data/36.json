They did it to Dan Christian\u2019s WIFE which was so gross.    \n\nBut, it\u2019s a subcontinent problem. RCB has more fans than let\u2019s say RR, so you\u2019ll see more toxicity in total from RCB. Just like how india has more population than Australia so you\u2019ll see more toxicity from Indian fans than Aussie.    \n\nIndian fans abused Dhoni and burnt effigies. Indians created an uproar when Harbhajan posed for an ad with a groomed/shaved beard. Indians pelted stones at ICT homes. Indians trolled Bumrah saying he only shows up for IPL and not for \u201cNational duty\u201d (cringe). Indians are booing hardik left-right knowing we don\u2019t have a single replacement for him, especially with what mugs our ICT pacers are with the bat. Dhoni fans act crazy on SM. They booed Jadeja and cheered for him to get out last year. Some Rohit stans are mad on Twitter, putting \u201cChokli\u201d down every opportunity they get. \n\nSo this is NOT an RCB problem. There\u2019s literally nothing different culturally about RCB fans than others. It\u2019s just strength in numbers in display.",

If they took the mark from the point at the crease he started at the ball looked above waist height. \n\nFor Indian fans regardless he looks in great touch. \n\nWill Jacks should be opening.

Absolutely waste.\n\nCase in point - Will Jacks getting out and then that ridiculous shot from Pattidar. RCB needed under 10 runs per over. They lost a wicket in that very over. \n\nThe game was with them. Then Cam Green comes in and tries to smack every ball and gets out. Sends in Lomror who doesn't last either. \n\nNow they have exposed their entire batting and finisher DK. They might still win this, but this is brain dead cricket. \n\nIf it works, you get 250 scores from SRH, if it doesn't, it's frankly horrible to watch.",

Openly yelling at your fielder for not throwing to the \"right\" end and gesturing at the fielder to \"use his eyes\" when the fielder did a good job getting the direct hit and it wasn't clear which end was the \"right\" end anyways.\n\nNot great stuff for team morale to have your captain losing the cool like that. Pat Cummins would never lose his cool like that.",

That means the position of batsman is taken into consideration.. Then why is it not the case of Kohli wicket where the technology says if Kohli was inside the crease it's not above waist... Why don't they say.. The batsman has moved and that has to have an impact on the waist high call so when Kohli's bat met the ball.. It was waist high... Think about it..",
