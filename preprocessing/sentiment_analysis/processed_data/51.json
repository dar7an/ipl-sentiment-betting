What matters is an accurate 145+ ball and some accurate slow well disguised stuff. Tye is a great example of not being relevant anymore because he can't hit 145 on his quick one and even when he hit's that pace he doesn't have accuracy. Bumrah makes you think he's around 140with accuracy or his slower ones have the batter guessing until the ball hits the pitch. Only archer and wood can do better now. Archer with his high 140s Yorkers and wood with accurate 150's that you have to play for. Bumrah has a 140 Yorker that he can nail constantly and that makes him the most dangerous bowler",

He bowled well in the WC final but if you remember the final over at the Semi vs NZ and overall performance in the WC you will remember what im saying. No where near as good as he was at his peak.\n\nIm  not being a hater here just a genuine observation.",

Maybe if Rohit had won WC23, he would have not been sacked this year but rather in 2025 with Hardik coming in this year no matter the WC 23 result. And let's be honest even if Rohit now wins WT20, no way he would captain ICT again in 2026,so MI wanted a future ICT captain.",

Yes he\u2019s lacking in high scoring games, but this is also a talent. He has a technically solid game (Ranji captain) so he\u2019s able to anchor with ease.   \n\nI\u2019m hoping for Pandya and SKY to play well today and take their form into the World Cup\n\nEDIT: well, shit.

He dots one, takes single on the last ball of the over. Nortje has the ball and tries to intimidate Thala with a surprising Sling action on the first bowl only to get hit for a six on the long-on. He hits sixes on the next 2 balls too. Ind needs 5 on 2 and then we suddenly hear Sting\u2019s music only to see Rayudu come out with another *3D in the bank* contract, cashes in and enters the match replacing Kuldeep. Thala has seen a ghost and doesn\u2019t know how to comprehend the situation. Nortje is ready to bowl a yorker but before he could bowl, Rayudu steps out reaching a quarter of the crease and screams, \u201c*Mankad me ya fucking idiot*\u201d. Nortje simply cannot bottle this and runs for his life towards the wicket to hit the stumps and done.\n\nRayudu costs Ind the match only to hijack the production room and announce on live telecast, \u201c*Haha I was not letting Thala insult me once again, Was I?*\u201d.",
