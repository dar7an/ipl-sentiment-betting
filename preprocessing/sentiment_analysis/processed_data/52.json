The fixed purse rule in IPL keeps such parity between teams that every match is even and fun, which is sorely missing in international cricket. Also there are so many different players you get to watch in IPL every year vs international cricket where it's the same guys over and over again. International T20 cricket is fine for world cups, but IPL is  superior to bilaterals, despite crap rules like Impact sub and flat pitches. It will be even better if a league with no foreign player cap pops up someday.",
