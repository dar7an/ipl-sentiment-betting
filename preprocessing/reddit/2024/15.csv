2024-04-02T16:18:05+00:00,Not even Umran (when be broke through) made me as excited as Mayank did. He’s got pace but what makes the pace all the more lethal is his control on the length. It’s not just 150kmph spray and pray,7
2024-04-02T16:18:08+00:00,Why Maxi ahead of Green now ?,2
2024-04-02T16:18:10+00:00,Judging by how it's going it Looks like women team of rcb took all of luck and game sense of men's team with them to win wpl,1

Yes he has shown better control than Umran has recently, much better in fact.

But to act like this is anywhere as much to do with line and length as it is do with searing pace is nonsense.

Half the balls Mayank has bowled in this game would be hit-me balls for bowlers who bowled a similar trajectory but only bowled say 140-145. Still rapid but on a T20 track if all you do is bowl back of a length at that pace you will get sent.

Mayank Yadav doesn't make it to the IPL, but behind closed doors practices regularly against top Indian batters, and plays practice games. Then he isn't picked for the world cup squad. India picks their regular expected squad, and makes it to the final (against Australia for example).

Then a couple of pacers fake injuries, and few other bowlers who are obvious injury replacements make them unavailable due to a variety of reasons. India left with no other choice, picks up an unknown random bowler named Mayank Yadav for the match. 

He bowls against Travis head in the second over. He bowls first 3 balls at 125 kph, making Head feel he's just a medium pacer. And then he bowls the 4th ball at 155 kph...onto the stumps... completely rattling Head, and eventually over the Australian batting line up as they get caught by a surprise.

India wins the T20 world cup after 17 years.",10

Last year they didn’t have Patidar so they were a batter short in already a thin line up, this year they have Patidar but maxwell and Faf have lost form. 

Every year it’s one thing or another. Back in gayle, AB, Kohli era…they would win a lot of games but choke near the end of the tournament. 

Now it’s just Kohli, a loud and passionate fan base that is depleting, and pure vibes. 

When Virat leaves they will become like that Delhi Daredevils team that finished last like 3 years In a row",10
