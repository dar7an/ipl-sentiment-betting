Take more risks, it's okay if you get out. Don't take a single after a boundary. Don't rotate strike against spinners. Accelerate, if you have wickets in hand.

Dont play for your 100. You clearly always do, and it costs the team.

It's not all your fault, you have been the best player for MI this season. But don't take the responsibiltiy of MI on your shoulders. Because if you do, it just doesn't work. Especially in T20s, one guy can't win you games. You need to trust that the middle and lower order will do well. 3 quick fire 30s > 1 medium paced 100.

I don't think MI will start winning games, if you take more risk and potentially get out. There are other big issues with the team and management. But atleast people will stop blaming you. Let the rest of the batters get a chance to do their job, if they fail, it's on them.

Take more risks, it's okay if you get out. Don't take a single after a boundary. Don't rotate strike against spinners. Accelerate, if you have wickets in hand.

Dont play for your 100. You clearly always do, and it costs the team.

It's not all your fault, you have been the best player for MI this season. But don't take the responsibiltiy of MI on your shoulders. Because if you do, it just doesn't work. Especially in T20s, one guy can't win you games. You need to trust that the middle and lower order will do well. 3 quick fire 30s > 1 medium paced 100.

I don't think MI will start winning games, if you take more risk and potentially get out. There are other big issues with the team and management. But atleast people will stop blaming you. Let the rest of the batters get a chance to do their job, if they fail, it's on them.

They are so good at finding and training local young talent but go all in on players like Ishan or Green in auction. Instead they could have bought Stubbs/QdK/Klassen/Pooran and would have spare money to buy good bowlers.

Plus SKY should open at non strikers end. Ishan or Rohit are both good fit in middle order and the best batter should get to play maximum balls.

Also they should switch around bowling squad if it is not working. All these matches lost and still Arjun/Kumar Karthikeya/Anshul Kamboj are warming the bench.

Take more risks, it's okay if you get out. Don't take a single after a boundary. Don't rotate strike against spinners. Accelerate, if you have wickets in hand.

Dont play for your 100. You clearly always do, and it costs the team.

It's not all your fault, you have been the best player for MI this season. But don't take the responsibiltiy of MI on your shoulders. Because if you do, it just doesn't work. Especially in T20s, one guy can't win you games. You need to trust that the middle and lower order will do well. 3 quick fire 30s > 1 medium paced 100.

I don't think MI will start winning games, if you take more risk and potentially get out. There are other big issues with the team and management. But atleast people will stop blaming you. Let the rest of the batters get a chance to do their job, if they fail, it's on them.

With a sling of arm, so swift, so sly,  
His yorkers zip, batsmen sigh.  
Each ball a whisper, quick and keen,  
Like lightning strikes, sharp and unseen.

Off the pitch, his spirit shines,  
Gentle grace, off those front lines.  
A warrior in whites and blues alike,  
With smiles that kindle, joyous and bright.

Through trials and triumphs, he stands tall,  
Bumrah, the bowler who enthralls us all.

2024-04-30T16:18:43+00:00,"Dear KL


Take more risks, it's okay if you get out. Don't take a single after a boundary. Don't rotate strike against spinners. Accelerate, if you have wickets in hand.

Dont play for your 100. You clearly always do, and it costs the team.

It's not all your fault, you have been the best player for LSG this season. But don't take the responsibiltiy of LSG on your shoulders. Because if you do, it just doesn't work. Especially in T20s, one guy can't win you games. You need to trust that the middle and lower order will do well. 3 quick fire 30s > 1 medium paced 100.

I don't think LSG will start winning games, if you take more risk and potentially get out. There are other big issues with the team and management. But atleast people will stop blaming you. Let the rest of the batters get a chance to do their job, if they fail, it's on them.

Take more risks, it's okay if you get out. Don't take a single after a boundary. Don't rotate strike against spinners. Accelerate, if you have wickets in hand.

Dont play for your ORANGE CAP. You clearly always do, and it costs the team.

It's not all your fault, you have been the best player for LSG this season. But don't take the responsibiltiy of LSG on your shoulders. Because if you do, it just doesn't work. Especially in T20s, one guy can't win you games. You need to trust that the middle and lower order will do well. 3 quick fire 30s > 1 ORANGE CAP.

I don't think LSG will start winning games, if you take more risk and potentially get out. There are other big issues with the team and management. But atleast people will stop blaming you. Let the rest of the batters get a chance to do their job, if they fail, it's on them.

Traditional Hooda control uses Krunal Pandya from the ground or air, but newer biological control methods are proving effective.
