2024-04-14T10:27:38+00:00,This team looks so fucking changed compared to the last 4 seasons. Go knights!!,6
2024-04-14T10:27:41+00:00,That's one of the top 3 catches taken by KKR fielders this season along with Suyash' and Manish'.,3
2024-04-14T10:27:41+00:00,You can remove DDP from the team but you can not remove DPP from the team!,9
2024-04-14T10:27:41+00:00,Hooda is a walking wicket at this point. Surely LSG can play one of the promising players they have in their squad instead?,1
2024-04-14T10:27:46+00:00,Hoodas technique is completely out of sorts. Even Iyer has better technique than this,1
2024-04-14T10:27:49+00:00,🐐 Starc looks so happy after that wicket! 🥹,2
2024-04-14T10:27:52+00:00,Eat balls and can't even fucking drive keeping it grounded. Anyone can play better than him why the fuck is he in the playing 11,1

2024-04-14T10:28:02+00:00,And now KL has to anchor coz the team is shit,5
2024-04-14T10:28:07+00:00,What else would you expect sending in Hooda so early? The only sad part is he gave Starc a wicket.,2

2024-04-14T10:29:12+00:00,There was a time when people in this sub were justifying why hooda should go to the world cup ahead of Kohli,12
2024-04-14T10:29:16+00:00,Seen the script. KL goes back into his shell now and LSG end up under par,6
2024-04-14T10:29:21+00:00,And again KL will be criticized for his slow strike rate!,4
2024-04-14T10:29:26+00:00,A good over from Starc. Finally,3

2024-04-14T10:29:46+00:00,starc+ramandeep to take a wicket were not on my bingo card today,2
2024-04-14T10:29:47+00:00,LSG unbeaten run of defending 160+ broken so they will start a run of losing when scoring 160+,3
2024-04-14T10:29:48+00:00,No way LSG thought sending Hooda at 3 would solve their problems at the no 3 spot🤣🤣,3
2024-04-14T10:29:51+00:00,Salute to Kolkata crowd for being there in this heat,5
2024-04-14T10:29:52+00:00,When kl  is playing with better strike rate lsg batting is crumbling. So he knows what he was doing.,1
2024-04-14T10:29:53+00:00,Hooda/DDP you just can't qualify with them,3
2024-04-14T10:29:56+00:00,Ramandeep had always fielded well. But he made mistakes when catching which could've easily happened due to nerves or pressure. This will give him a ton of confidence,3
2024-04-14T10:29:58+00:00,"With the kind of batting form KKR is in, LSG will need 220, which is usually beyond the reach and mindset of someone like KL these days. Could send Pooran earlier to bat longer.",3

2024-04-14T10:30:35+00:00,I heard Ramandeep dropped catches before this. Were those sitters or tough ones like this?,2
2024-04-14T10:30:35+00:00,"I actually don’t blame KL being an anchor here, this is probably one of the few times to justify that sort of play style",6

Conflicted? Does it tempt you to switch sides? Or this is just a marketing gimmick",5

2024-04-14T10:30:45+00:00,Is salt sleeping or what,2
2024-04-14T10:30:54+00:00,Atleast this LSG jersey looks better than thier main jersey,6

2024-04-14T10:31:29+00:00,I find Starc critism a little funny. Sure he doesn't perform well in every game and he is not as consistent as Hoff or Bumrah but he's always phenomenal in knockouts or other crucial matches so I feel it's fine.,6
2024-04-14T10:31:29+00:00,Shot,3
2024-04-14T10:31:33+00:00,Last match must have given tons of confidence to Badoni. He & KL can do big from here.,2

Visited for the semi, dear god, the seats are uncomfortable and often dirty. They sell seats with blocked views with no prior notification. The volume of stuff you can't bring in is atrocious but more than that the behaviour of the staff - geez. They make you walk a country mile before you can enter, the food stalls hardly leave you any space to walk, the toilets are not worth entering, I can go on and on and on...

Kolkata is a beautiful city. Bengalis are warm and hospitable. They love their cricket. They live this game. They'd know more about Aussie players than half our population. 

They deserve better than what Bengal Cricket does for them and what BCCI does for them. Eden Gardens is iconic yes, but an absolute mess, sorry.",18
