2024-05-14T13:43:13+00:00,Stubbs pic had wide eyes like Anya Taylor joy. I guess that's why he is so good in batting and fielding.,4

2024-05-14T13:54:08+00:00,"Unless DC can magically win by such a ginormous margin that puts their run rate back in contention, an LSG win is the best result to keep more of the remaining games interesting and meaningful.",8

2024-05-14T13:56:02+00:00,"I think a lot of non SRH fans think Warner was wronged by the management which is not the full story.

There was certainly a lot more that happened. He was rightfully blocked by SRH on Twitter because he would engage with fans in the comments and post totally unrelated shit to try and win popular support. His tiktok dances on Telugu songs started feeling very strategic and it was very visible there's something more. Warner will always be loved but we acknowledge what happened.",-11
2024-05-14T13:56:33+00:00,Sad end to Warner's IPL stint but it was a good IPL career.,3

2024-05-14T13:58:54+00:00,"Lol fans are just too fickle. If Warner was persisted with and stayed in the team, fans would be out here justifying even if he gets 5 ducks in a row, but now that he's not here I guess open season to shit on him.

Here is the csk pattern this IPL. 

2 wins 2 losses, 2 wins 2 losses, 1 win 1 loss, 1 win 1 loss, 
Extending this pattern of csk to the last set of games, csk already has 1 win so if they lose to RCB they continue the pattern of 1win 1 loss. 

Hence they need to break this pattern. 

On the RCB side the pattern this IPL is. 

1 loss 1 win, 6 loss 5 win. 
They need to complete the pattern by winning against csk making it 6 loss 6 win. 

I would say out of the both teams the pattern is on RCB's side because they need to continue the pattern while csk needs to break it.",23
