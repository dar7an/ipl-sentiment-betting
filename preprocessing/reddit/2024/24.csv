2024-04-10T13:03:45+00:00,"I swear on my life, whenever I watch the match the wicket falls, the day I skip it's a 200 runs score 

I haven't seen a single klassen-rinku inning all this IPL except last match where both failed 

Never seen a rohit-kohli inning, I like RR whenever I watch them jaiswal fails, last inning I closed the match after jaiswal scoring duck, and inform buttler made century ( I got back and riyan got out the first ball I watched) 

But today I will not watch this match when RR bats, and I can bet my life, yassu will perform today

Iyer: Short balls, well. Trouble against swing. Can't really always build an innings against good spin, is a better bet against spin in the short formats where quick runs are important (better as a spin basher but not overall batter). Injury prone.

Pandya: Was a phenomenal hitter with very strong wrists, back swivel and arms.

2024-04-10T16:23:19+00:00,"FYI, not intending to criticize any players with this post. 

  
I feel like people are missing the point a bit with parag and other guys in the indian lineup. Parag's innings at the 20 ball mark this season have been: 28(20), 16(20, 20(20), 22(20). There's been reason's for these slowish starts (rajistan opting for a more bowling focused side, early wickets coming in a clump often, etc). but I really don't see how this start to an innings approach is much different to the ""tuk tuk"" approach that partially cost india the 2022 t20 knockout vs england, and you see people on here getting so mad about. 

  
In that knockout game, hardik who walked out in a similar type of ""slower start, few early wickets, in a clump, rajastan style bowler at 7 type lineup"" and made 24(20) before going berserk and ending up making 63 at 190. Realistically, if parag plays for india at this WC, he doesn't replace SKY at 4, so he's going to bat 5 or at 3. I don't think parag playing a knock that's been typical to him this season really makes india's approach any different to the more conservation model that bit them in the WC knockout last time. If your going to make that kind of change, parag isn't likely going to be the player to do it, it's gonna be from a change in intent from the top 3 like we've seen from rohit this IPL. India can afford one kohli type 130-140 SR player at the top if they've got faster scorer's like jaiswal, sky, new model rohit and rinku around him. They can't afford more than one.",5

Sanju- let's give overs to Ashwin & Kuldeep",19
2024-04-10T18:28:02+00:00,Y'all can laugh but 3d's 16(10) can't be ignored,20
2024-04-10T18:28:05+00:00,"Honestly not that big of a deal

Shhould've, could've, would've... What we needed was to get that loss out of our system and hopefully we did


Onto the next game against our best rivals Punjab",14
2024-04-10T18:28:14+00:00,bruh even Sanju while batting first assumed that 180 would have been a par score on this pitch.,10
2024-04-10T18:28:17+00:00,"as a csk fan, I am supporting sanju's üò≠üò≠üò≠ RR this year.",11
2024-04-10T18:28:25+00:00,Shoutout to SRK and 3D they didn't scored a lot but kept the scoreboard ticking...,13

Makes me nostalgic for the 2022 season",16
2024-04-10T18:29:07+00:00,It was Parag who messed up Sen's mind interrupting him after every ball in thr 18th over. He was bowling so well before,1
2024-04-10T18:29:20+00:00,Over rate also costed them in the last over?,8
2024-04-10T18:29:33+00:00,People calling out Samson for not bowling Boult at the death there have clearly never seen Boult bowl at the death in the IPL. üòÇüòÇ,28
2024-04-10T18:29:41+00:00,"Brohit also going to join GT soon after getting backstabbed by franchise

2024-04-10T18:29:55+00:00,Why not just let Boult complete his overs early on? Just 2 overs?,8
2024-04-10T18:30:11+00:00,Which watch does Eoin Morgan have?,3
2024-04-10T18:31:04+00:00,Ashwin and Sen's last 19th over cost RR the match,9
2024-04-10T18:31:17+00:00,I think defending 15 with 4 fielders in the last over was always going to a tough ask.,6
2024-04-10T18:31:26+00:00,"Rahul tewatia will keep pulling off incredible chases at death and come the next game, people will still doubt can he do it today, was that previous one fluke, is he really capable....",15
2024-04-10T18:31:36+00:00,"I know 3d , I know you will be again forgotten , with all these celebrations ,all these high praises for Rashid, Tewatia and gill They won't say anything about your 16 of 10 under pressure, but how can i, how can i my lord ............",8
2024-04-10T18:31:58+00:00,Tewatia deserves to play for India,3
2024-04-10T18:32:04+00:00,"Boult bowling two overs is an issue but he shouldn't have bowled the last over imo

Boult is not a death bowler see the Punjab MI Super over where Punjab

He should finish his quota before the end of the middle overs

But Sen bowled really well today and Maharaj was playing his first game

Also Avesh had been really good for RR in death overs before this game 

Samson Parag partnership also felt a bit slow tbh especially that over against Rashid where they took only 5 singles despite having wickets in hand and both being set",8
2024-04-10T18:32:13+00:00,I feel like the GT vs RR rivalry is underrated¬†,25
2024-04-10T18:33:55+00:00,RR already lost the match with 15 needed in over. Bowler doesn't matter except Bumrah. Rashid and Tewatia are really good finishers. Gill took the match away. Also RR failed to accelerate with set batsmen.,18
2024-04-10T18:34:23+00:00,"Again, well done GT.


But the rule about one fielder less for running late is ridiculous.


It should not impact the game. There are factors outside the control of the captain that impact time, such as no of boundaries and reviews.¬†


Absolute bs rule.


If you want to impose penalties, impose financial ones and not a stupid rule that impacts the outcome of the match.


Downvote away, i don't care. Stupid rule is stupid.",-39
2024-04-10T18:34:25+00:00,People here underestimating GT. Both Tewatia & Rashid are clutch match winners. They have done this many times,34
2024-04-10T18:36:13+00:00,"Man, I actually hoped that Rashid would find his form again but definitely not in this one match!
Did I make some miscalculations while wishing. Lol.",9
2024-04-10T18:37:50+00:00,Woo lala now shubhman teasing with his legs,11
2024-04-10T18:38:02+00:00,I don't understand boult bullshit. That guy didn't bowl a single death over this season. Avesh defended 17 against DC and is their prime death bowler along with sandeep. Sanju's only mistake was to bowl ashwin in that 17th over. He should have bowled keshav with the right hander in there.,20
2024-04-10T18:39:16+00:00,Gill: Rashid Bhai!! Isn‚Äôt Rashid like 18 and this guy 22?,14
2024-04-10T18:39:33+00:00,What did Gill say at the end?,8
