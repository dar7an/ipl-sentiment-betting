2024-04-21T12:29:03+00:00,been playing cricket since 2 decades doesn't know if you stand outside crease the waist high would still be calculated as if you are inside crease.,5
2024-04-21T12:29:03+00:00,So many r/cricket experts here don't  know how the no ball rule works,4

2024-04-21T12:29:09+00:00,Rules are wrong. They are using popping crease as the metric. They should be using original stance,10

2024-04-21T12:29:09+00:00,0.92m. Wasn't even marginal lol.,8

2024-04-21T12:29:10+00:00,"The bowl should be measured when at the height when the bowl was released


So koach was outside the crease from the 1st second 

So that should be the point zero",6

2024-04-21T12:29:18+00:00,"Glad that they took players waist measurements for the no ball. 

Now why couldn't they take the heights as well for wides instead of wasting time going back and forth in the replay??",6
2024-04-21T12:29:18+00:00,i thought it was a no ball for sure,4
2024-04-21T12:29:19+00:00,Kohli is arguing that he's a 5 foot manlet,9
2024-04-21T12:29:19+00:00,It's below the waist. Simple.,7
2024-04-21T12:29:19+00:00,He moved out of crease would go slight under his waist if he was in the crease,2
2024-04-21T12:29:19+00:00,Kohli definitely didn’t anchor today,3

2024-04-21T12:29:23+00:00,"Kohli fanboys won't accept but the height is supposed to be measured at the crease and not point of impact, and the tracking clearly showed it was going slightly under the waist. So fair delivery",9
2024-04-21T12:29:23+00:00,Will rcb loose fair play points coz he argued with umpires?,7
2024-04-21T12:29:23+00:00,No Indian third umpire no party for the “star” players.,6
2024-04-21T12:29:24+00:00,What's he on about? About a foot outside his crease,5
2024-04-21T12:29:24+00:00,"Before RCBros start coping here, Kohli was outside of popping crease. Big deal for waist-high no balls. The trajectory was dripping below waist as it reached the line",8

But, it’s a subcontinent problem. RCB has more fans than let’s say RR, so you’ll see more toxicity in total from RCB. Just like how india has more population than Australia so you’ll see more toxicity from Indian fans than Aussie.    

Indian fans abused Dhoni and burnt effigies. Indians created an uproar when Harbhajan posed for an ad with a groomed/shaved beard. Indians pelted stones at ICT homes. Indians trolled Bumrah saying he only shows up for IPL and not for “National duty” (cringe). Indians are booing hardik left-right knowing we don’t have a single replacement for him, especially with what mugs our ICT pacers are with the bat. Dhoni fans act crazy on SM. They booed Jadeja and cheered for him to get out last year. Some Rohit stans are mad on Twitter, putting “Chokli” down every opportunity they get. 

So this is NOT an RCB problem. There’s literally nothing different culturally about RCB fans than others. It’s just strength in numbers in display.",16

Still don't agree with that Kohli decision. He started quite far out of the crease before the ball was bowled. The 0.99m mark was taken behind the position Kohli started at before the ball was bowled. If they took the mark from the point at the crease he started at the ball looked above waist height. 

For Indian fans regardless he looks in great touch.

Case in point - Will Jacks getting out and then that ridiculous shot from Pattidar. RCB needed under 10 runs per over. They lost a wicket in that very over. 

The game was with them. Then Cam Green comes in and tries to smack every ball and gets out. Sends in Lomror who doesn't last either.

Not great stuff for team morale to have your captain losing the cool like that. Pat Cummins would never lose his cool like that.",11

If the batsman moves to his right or left in the crease and that has an impact on weather it is a wide delivery or not.. That means the position of batsman is taken into consideration.. Then why is it not the case of Kohli wicket where the technology says if Kohli was inside the crease it's not above waist... Why don't they say.. The batsman has moved and that has to have an impact on the waist high call so when Kohli's bat met the ball.. It was waist high... Think about it..",-1
