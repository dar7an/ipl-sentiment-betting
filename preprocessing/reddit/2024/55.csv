2024-05-06T13:23:07+00:00,"Umran and Tripathi have to play.

A bowler like Umran will do WAY better on the Wankhede surface than Unadkat. Kishan and Hardik hate express pace.

Our number 3 has been our weakest link. Tripathi has a great record against MI, especially Bumrah. Yes, he's a little weak against spin but MI doesn't have good spinners.",4

England, South Africa and West Indies have proper t20 teams but they are not talked about as much as Australia, especially considering t20 is not the strongest suit of Australia.

Tell them you're not interested in retention, go into auction, make millions. 

It would be really cool to see where he ends up. Maybe RCB as the next captain? Maybe even PBKS? So many teams will be looking for a captain and would love to strengthen their bowling. I daresay Pant's captaincy has been a little lacking this year, and he will not have a problem giving it up to Bumrah to get him in the team. The possibilities are really exciting. Bumrah at MI has gotten so stale and let's face it, he should've been captain this year. 100%.",9

Any MI player at this point should consider trade or going into auction. I wrote a post about this.

2024-05-06T15:20:51+00:00,"Our batting is such a glass cannon man, this is what I mean when I say that the ""upcoming batting"" after 2 wickets are down just doesn't feel reassuring, it's so paper thin. There's no one quite reliable like with teams like RR and KKR (who recover even after they have 5 down) and that sorta sucks, the amount of collapses in the last 5 games hasn't been pretty, it's sad how inconsistent the batting is and it also feels like everyone depends on the other to perform and show no initiative to asses the situation and play accordingly to dig the team out of the hole (esp disappointing when Klassen does this).   
  
Something feels off and I think that's going to be the difference when it comes to why we're probably not winning this season compared to the top 2. Those 2 bad losses rly felt like they messed with the batting and it hasn't been the same since even, the mojo esp with the opening pair has been lost, and the holes are really starting to show.

Our batting is just the so unreliable, and it sucks that Klassen never seems to deliver when we actually need it either. F  
  
For a team that's supposed to be known for its batting, I get insanely nervous after we're about two down, exactly because of what's happening now, and that's not a good feeling esp when you compare it with the batting depth teams like RR and KKR. The collapses in the last 4-5 games have been very concerning, it never feels even remotely safe after 3 wickets fall. We need actual match-winners. I'm also not very confident with Abhi and Head as a pair anymore, feels like those 2 bad games killed the mojo and firepower of that pair.",4

2024-05-06T15:39:14+00:00,"We just don't have match winners after the first 2-3 wickets do we? Just so unreliable. Our batting during those chases were terrible, but those losses have absolutely rattled this team and now they can't even deliver when we're batting first? I know it's normal to have off days but it's been about 5 games since the 287. Even teams like KKR and RR have off days but someone always steps up and it never seems to last for more than one game. SRH legit feels like they've been broken open.

Pat should promote himself to the middle order tbh. Feels like a way more reliable anchor at this point than anyone who comes in after number 4.",2

1. Abhishek should learn to play long innings

3. Jansen is not doing any good. It’s fine to test Glenn Philips at this point and get a domestic bowler in place of Mayank Agarwal",7
