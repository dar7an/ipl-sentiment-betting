The way you dive into the catch and strike fear into your enemies eyes. Your silky smooth grip on the bat, and that gorgeous wicketkeeping stance. I would do anything for you. I wish it were possible to freeze time so I would never have to watch you retire.  
You had a rough childhood, but you never gave up hope. You are even amazing off the pitch, you're a great husband and father, sometimes I even call you dad. I forever dread and weep, thinking of the day you will one day retire. I would sacrifice my own life it were the only thing that could put a smile on your beautiful face.  
You have given me so much joy, and heartbreak over the years. I remember when CSK got suspended and its like my heart got broken into a million pieces. But a tear still fell from my right eye when I watched you win your first IPL trophy once CSK was reinstated, because deep down, my glorious king deserved it. I just wanted you to return home. Then alas, you did, my sweet baby boy came home and I rejoiced. 2016 and 2017 were hard years for us baby, but in 2018 you made history happen. You came back home and I couldn't believe it. 5 championships and 10 finals. Here's to 6 and 11 <3  
In 2020, I was crying, bawling even, and I heard my glorious king exclaim these words, ""DEFINITELY NOT!"" Not only have you changed the game of cricket and the world forever, but you've eternally changed my world. And now you're getting older, but still the goat, my goat. I love you pookie bear, my glorious THALA, MS DHONI.",1

Thala did the job for me",16
2024-03-31T18:13:15+00:00,The Jaddu- Dube patnership sealed it ? Not the major reason though) . It is scary to see them not trying anything different or upset the rhythm by trying something different. Instead they kept taking singles .  Dube not surprised but not Jadeja. That guys gives everything for the team and has far better batsman,2
2024-03-31T18:13:16+00:00,"You gotta understand one thing, CSK batting works on the basis of backing players to the hilt. Which means you get below average knocks like Dube's and Jaddu's from time to time. They are given full backing to trust their abilities and do what they feel is right in the middle, which has worked well for us in the past. Like Dube backed himself to hit those 2 sixers in that last Rashid over in the final. More often than not, it comes off.

Also I think Dhoni's knee is not 100 percent alright.",26
2024-03-31T18:13:35+00:00,Why Harsha switched to Hindi? Panty can speak English just fine.,3

2024-03-31T18:16:49+00:00,"Damn, no one thought Thala would bat like this at 42. When Hussey said Dhoni is ""hitting well"" in the nets, I had no idea that he was hitting this well. Jadeja looked like a dummy in front of Thala.",30

2024-03-31T18:19:44+00:00,Plot twist: Jah Shah was impersonating Hussey using deepfake to predict Dhoni batting in last over to increase the ticket sales,16

2024-03-31T18:22:47+00:00,"This is India where if a bowler takes wicket then the credit goes to thala, king and brohit because they ""talked"" with the bowler before the over. But if the bowler goes for runs then it's his own fault!!",25
2024-03-31T18:25:19+00:00,"I hope people are joking because Khaleel was hella inconsistent for us when he played for NT. Wait till the end of the tournament then think about his consideration, and I don't think anyone's place in danger in the squad.",12

Even today why would you even bowl Rasikh and Marsh. Won despite idiotic stuff.",34
2024-03-31T18:40:48+00:00,Jadeja is just not able to hit from get go. His best position is 4 or 5,13

Jay Shah and his scripts never disappoint!!",53
2024-03-31T18:47:47+00:00,What a treat it is to see MS Dhoni do his thing. It was a long shot but he certainly gave it his all. Will be a sad day when he finally calls it quits.,55
