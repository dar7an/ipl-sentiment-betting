2024-04-18T15:19:15+00:00,People wondering what happened to Arshdeep - it's the same thing that happens to 99.99% of bowlers in history who are yorker merchants. It's too hard to sustainably bowl yorkers unless you are aided by something like a strange action (there's a reason Malinga/Bumrah low full tosses were still hard to hit). Miss your length by an inch and it's a slot ball getting smashed or a full toss that's easy to deposit.,8

2024-04-18T18:25:13+00:00,"Again the ones talking about Dube in place of Hardik.

Dube hasn't bowled a single over in last two seasons. Not even a single over. We are talking about pacer all rounder spot. Not a ""guy who can maybe fill in as part timer if rarely needed"" spot. Bowling in SMAT vs IPL is a different beast. You want him to suddenly start bowling for India in a WC?

Seriously just think about it for a second, how can you not see it?

No matter what you think of Hardik. He literally is one of his kind for India. Closest option is Shardul Thakur, that's it and he hasn't bowled well. 

Hardik has also proven more clutch many times in LOI's than Thakur, so it should be a no brainer that we need a in form Pandya for India, not a mentally abused, down on morale Pandya. It could've been fine if we had good pace line up but it's just Bumrah and no one else.

You can't deny that player wise India needs him, there's a reason why India was hoping so much for Pandya's recovery in 2023 WC until finally declaring his injury.",11
