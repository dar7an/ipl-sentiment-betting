2024-05-17T14:02:59+00:00,"I don't get the hate for Arjun Tendulkar playing today.

The guy bowled reasonably well in the powerplay last year. 0/17(2.0) vKKR 1/18(2.5) vSRH, and 1/9(2.0) vGT with one terrible match against PBKS 1/48(3.0)

Those are respectable numbers for anyone. And his Domestic T20 strike rate is 14.8 ^(which is better than Mukesh Kumar, Arshdeep, Avesh, Harshal Patel, Chetan Sakariya, T Natarajan, Khaleel, N Saini, D Chahar, all whom have debuted for India)

Yes, his stats are on a small sample size, but ffs, they're completely fine, and _technically_ better than every fast bowler who's debuted for India in the last 5 years at least. I'm not saying he's at the level of Natarajan, Arshdeep or any of them.

But chill the fuck out with the nepotism claims. What you're saying is basically **""He doesn't deserve to play because his father is a legend, unlike other player"".** And you guys wonder why a few players take mental health breaks.",1

Rahul doesn't attack the power play well, but he does milk the middle overs and rotate well, accelerating if he lasts long enough. Usually he plays a run a ball until 'fixing it' to a 130-150 later on, this would actually be okay if you've got a pooran at the other side all the time.

So many times he was trying that slower wide one with the ball, when it's a known fact that he's at his best when he's clicking 140 at length/back of length.
