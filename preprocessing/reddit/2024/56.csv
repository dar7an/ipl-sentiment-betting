The change we see in T20I cricket has happened earlier as when we saw the move from Tests to ODI. Even within ODI, going from 60 overs to 50 overs, then the first 15 over fielding restrictions, Jaysurya making great use of that, etc etc.

While test cricket is a beautiful thing, ODI democratized cricket more and T20 more so. More smaller countries are slowly becoming prominent. I know, painfully slowly, perhaps, but still better than nothing.

The good balls of yester-years may not always be good balls today, based on the pitch. But new good balls will emerge‚Ä¶
