One night, Harshal Patel was sleeping soundly in his room, dreaming of how many slower balls he would bowl in the next match, when he was visited by a genie who offered to give him the thing he wanted most.

Harshal was stunned and immediately accepted the offer. ""I want my hair back"", he said groggily after recovering from the shock. ""But"", said the genie, ""there's a catch. When you recover your hair, you will lose all your skills in something else. And I have no idea what it will be.""

Desperate to have his hair back and feeling he had nothing to lose, Harshal agreed to take the risk. Unfortunately for him, the area in which he lost his skills was nothing other than bowling, the way he has earned his livelihood for many years.

Today, many of those no longer blessed with luscious locks speak in hushed tones of their awe for the newly hirsute Hairshal Patel. He may have lost his magical powers with the ball in hand, but he has gained not only his hair but also the respect of many bald frauds around the globe, something which is far more valuable to him.",3

Mayank looks a bit taller and front on, hits the pitch harder, and really gets the ball to rise at the batter.

Umran more front on/side on hybrid, skiddier, and looks to hit the stumps.

I know people are worried about the transition post Ishant/Umesh/Shami but we have enough youngsters like Mayank Yadav, Umran, Harshit Rana, Himanshu Chauhan, Karthik Tyagi, with raw materials in that 21-25 age range to be very positive about Indian fast bowling.

That's not even to mention slightly older and very skillful experienced first class bowlers like Akash Deep.",17

Dhawan should let go of the captaincy, he's a robot, no innovation with his captaincy, does nothing new, no gameplan, no strategy, no field placements, just leaks runs, focuses on matchups and doesn't trust Brar

His captaincy easily leaks us 35-40 runs, his obsession with third man and fine leg inside the circle costs us so many runs man

Doesn't give bowlers the field according to their strengths, just textbook fields, I'm tired man, this 11 is pretty damn good, just need leadership on field.",12
