I'm creating new comments for the wider benefits of the respectable members of this sub.

Q: Why doesn't hardik bowl Bumrah every over? Is he stupid?

A: In T20 cricket, each team is limited to bowling a maximum of 20 overs in an innings. According to the laws of cricket, a bowler is limited to bowling a maximum of four overs in a T20 match. This means that no single bowler can bowl more than four overs in a T20 innings. Therefore, it is not legal for a bowler to bowl all the overs in a T20 match. Each team must use a combination of bowlers to bowl the 20 overs allowed in the innings. This rule ensures fairness and maintains the balance between batting and bowling in the T20 format.",6

2024-05-11T16:06:45+00:00,"Q: Why did Narine decide to leave tho, haha. I don't think he usually leaves.

A: Sunil Narine, the West Indian cricketer known for his spin bowling and explosive batting in T20 cricket, has been a key player for various franchises in domestic T20 leagues around the world. If he decided to leave a particular league or team, it could be due to various reasons:



1. \*\*Personal Reasons\*\*: Players may decide to leave a league or team due to personal reasons such as family commitments, health issues, or the need for a break from cricket.



2. \*\*Contractual Obligations\*\*: Sometimes, players have contractual obligations with different leagues or teams, and they may need to prioritize one over the other based on their agreements and schedules.



3. \*\*Injury Concerns\*\*: Injuries can also play a role in a player's decision to leave a league or team. If a player is nursing an injury or feels that participating in a particular league could aggravate their injury, they may opt to withdraw from the competition.



4. \*\*Form or Performance\*\*: If a player is experiencing a dip in form or performance, they may choose to take a step back and reassess their game. In such cases, they might decide to skip certain tournaments or leagues to work on their skills and regain their form.



5. \*\*Team Dynamics or Management\*\*: Issues within the team, such as conflicts with management or teammates, can influence a player's decision to leave. A negative team environment or lack of support from the management could prompt a player to seek opportunities elsewhere.



Without specific details about Sunil Narine's departure from a particular league or team, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact reason behind his decision. However, it's not uncommon for players to make such decisions based on a combination of factors related to their personal circumstances, contractual agreements, and career considerations.",0

2024-05-11T16:07:56+00:00,"Q: bumrah told iyer the entire season he‚Äôd get him out on a duck, why would he lie to us?

A: Jasprit Bumrah, the Indian fast bowler, may have made such a statement in a light-hearted or competitive spirit. Cricket is known for its banter and friendly rivalries between players, both on and off the field. It's not uncommon for players to engage in playful taunting or friendly challenges with their teammates or opponents.

In this case, if Bumrah told Shreyas Iyer that he would get him out on a duck throughout the season, it could be a way for Bumrah to express confidence in his bowling abilities or to motivate himself and Iyer to perform at their best during their encounters on the field.

However, it's essential to remember that such statements are often made in the spirit of sportsmanship and competitiveness and should not be taken too seriously. Ultimately, cricket is a game, and players engage in these interactions to add to the excitement and camaraderie of the sport.",-2

2024-05-11T16:09:00+00:00,"Q: Is Bumrah's action shady? Why is it so ugly anyway lol

A: Jasprit Bumrah's bowling action has been a subject of discussion among cricket fans and experts. Some people may perceive his action as unorthodox or ""ugly"" due to its unconventional nature compared to traditional bowling actions. However, it's essential to distinguish between an unconventional action and a ""shady"" or illegal action.

Bumrah's bowling action has been scrutinized by cricket authorities, including the International Cricket Council (ICC), to ensure it complies with the laws and regulations of the game. As of my last update, Bumrah's action has been deemed legal by cricket's governing bodies, and he has not faced any significant issues regarding its legality.

It's important to note that what matters most in cricket is whether a bowler's action adheres to the laws of the game, specifically concerning the straightening of the bowling arm during the delivery stride. If a bowler's action is found to exceed the permissible limit of elbow extension, it can be deemed illegal, and the bowler may face sanctions.

While some may find Bumrah's action unconventional or unattractive, it has proven to be highly effective for him. Bumrah has become one of the world's premier fast bowlers across all formats of the game, showcasing his skill and accuracy with his unique bowling action.

Ultimately, the beauty of cricket lies in its diversity, and different players bring their own styles and techniques to the game. What matters most is that their actions comply with the rules and regulations set forth by the sport's governing bodies.",-4

2024-05-11T16:13:52+00:00,"Q: Why do MI change bowler after 1 good over ?

A: In cricket, especially in the shorter formats like T20, teams often employ a strategy of rotating their bowlers frequently to keep the batting team guessing and to exploit different matchups and conditions. This strategy is not unique to the Mumbai Indians (MI) but is common among many teams.

There are several reasons why a team might choose to change a bowler after just one good over:

1. \*\*Variety\*\*: By constantly changing bowlers, teams can introduce different bowling styles, paces, and variations, making it harder for batsmen to settle into a rhythm. This variety can help keep the batsmen guessing and prevent them from getting comfortable at the crease.

2. \*\*Matchups\*\*: Teams might have specific plans for certain batsmen based on their strengths and weaknesses. Changing bowlers allows teams to exploit favorable matchups and apply pressure on key batsmen.

3. \*\*Bowler Workload\*\*: Bowling can be physically demanding, especially in T20 cricket where bowlers often bowl at maximum intensity. By rotating bowlers frequently, teams can manage their workload and keep them fresh throughout the innings.

4. \*\*Adaptation to Conditions\*\*: Conditions can change rapidly during a cricket match, affecting the effectiveness of certain bowlers. By rotating bowlers, teams can adapt to changing conditions and optimize their bowling attack accordingly.

5. \*\*Strategic Considerations\*\*: Sometimes, captains make bowling changes based on gut feeling or intuition, especially if they sense a particular bowler is about to be targeted by the opposition batsmen. Making proactive changes can help prevent the batting team from gaining momentum.

Overall, the decision to change bowlers frequently is part of a team's overall strategy to control the game, apply pressure on the opposition, and maximize their chances of taking wickets and restricting runs.",-5

2024-05-11T16:18:02+00:00,"Q: Why is Tim David there in the injury huddle? Is he a physio as well in addition to being a coach.

A: Tim David is primarily known as a professional cricketer, particularly in the T20 format. He has played for various domestic and franchise teams around the world. If he was seen in an injury huddle, it's unlikely that he was acting as a physiotherapist. 

However, it's not uncommon for players to be involved in team discussions or huddles, especially during breaks in play or injury timeouts. Players often provide support and encouragement to their teammates, discuss tactics, or offer insights based on their experiences on the field.

Without specific context, it's challenging to determine why Tim David was present in the injury huddle. It's possible that he was providing moral support or offering tactical advice to his teammates. Additionally, players who are not directly involved in the game at that moment sometimes join huddles to stay engaged and maintain team unity.",2

2024-05-11T16:26:18+00:00,"Q: Why doesn‚Äôt ishan just jump 12 feet to catch these? Is he stupid???

A: Catching a cricket ball involves more than just jumping high. It requires timing, judgment of trajectory, coordination, and often, split-second decision-making. While height can be an advantage in reaching for high catches, it's not the only factor that determines a successful catch.

Players need to assess the flight of the ball, position themselves correctly, time their jump accurately, and maintain focus to securely grasp the ball. Additionally, factors such as wind, lighting conditions, and the speed of the ball can further complicate the catch.

It's not accurate or fair to call someone ""stupid"" simply because they weren't able to make a catch. Cricket is a challenging sport that requires skill, practice, and mental focus, and even the best players drop catches from time to time. Making mistakes is a natural part of the game, and players learn and improve from these experiences.",7

2024-05-11T16:28:58+00:00,"Q: Do we have two CEAT^(TM)¬†Strategic timeout in a 16 over match?

A: In the Indian Premier League (IPL) or any other T20 cricket tournament, the number of strategic timeouts allowed remains the same regardless of the duration of the match. Each team is typically allowed one strategic timeout per innings, regardless of whether it's a standard 20-over match, a reduced-overs match due to weather interruptions, or any other scenario.



Therefore, in a 16-over match, each team would still be entitled to one strategic timeout, as per the standard rules of the tournament. The strategic timeout duration and timing would remain consistent with the rules of the tournament, typically lasting for a maximum of two and a half minutes and taken between specific overs as designated by the regulations.",1

Bumrah: GT or another team that needs a pacer. Needless to say could be the one of the most expensive trades. 

SKY: could do well in LSG? 

David: while he's not the best MI export, I think PBKS seems like his kind of team 

Tilak: SRH or RCB. Great player and amazing value addition. 

Wadhera: seems like a very RR kind of player. KKR is packed, so idk. 

Ishan: probably CSK since Dhoni won't be there next season and they'll need a keeper. Then again, Ishan seems to be loyal to MI, so who knows. 

Brohit: no clue. Could be RCB, LSG or a team that needs a specialist captain. Really hard to predict.",3

Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing.

Hardik is bowling 4 overs a game when he should really be a 6th or 7th bowler with the impact sub( only because he wants to ready for the T20 WC). The owners were foolish to replace the current all format Indian captain with another player and destabilize the team. It takes even more balls to think the fans would accept this decision when their captain has been the most successful IPL captain of all time.  No hate to Hardik or Rohit, it's entirely on the owners. If the owners were really desperate for Hardik which is understandable then they should have traded Rohit to GT. Bumrah seems to be the only guy who gives a crap.",9

People don't realize gow hard it is to be consistent and explosive while batting outside the poweplay. Klaasen might just be the best T20 batsman right now and even he's been a bit inconsistent this season. People are already calling Rinku overrated when anyone who watches games knows that he just doesn't get enough chances to bat due to Salt-Narine carnage. I blame the orange cap and other similar metrics which tricks people to into prioritizing aggregate runs where middle order batters struggle. Even Pooran had 2 bad years in the IPL and everyone was after him.,22

Rohit Sharma is playing terribly in the IPL, and has been, for years. I, like a lot of others, feel that Rohit shouldn't be leading our WC squad, or even be a part of it perhaps

BUT

Please don't get carried away and act like he's not an excellent ODI player. He's not a G.O.A.T contender like Virat Kohli, but he's really good. Definitely India's second best over the last decade, and perhaps even a top 5 contender internationally, with a few like Amla, AbD above him",3

2024-05-11T19:15:36+00:00,Brohit really played 4 overs (including powerplay) and made 19 runs lmao,5

2024-05-11T19:19:36+00:00,I usually support players in their downfall but mehh Rohit exclusion would only help ICT,7
2024-05-11T19:20:26+00:00,"Daily reminder to you folks, if your team's doing well, enjoy it. Jay Shah's comments regarding impact player rule makes me think that there won't be too many changes in retention slots.

2024-05-11T19:21:57+00:00,"Why is MI performing like this?

I would like to simply say that hardik happened but the truth is that this was bound to happen with the squad they had. Rohit was always given a good squad to work with, with clutch players like malinga, Pollard, boult etc. . He was a good captain but he was never able to perform himself in ipl. He has always been terrible in T20s.

You cannot rely on these big Indian cricketers to perform under tough conditions. It's the ICT after all. They were fucked as soon as they went with a team that was dominated by big Indian players with massive PR. They keep calling this squad a very dangerous looking squad and wondering why it does not perform but in practice, it's filled with unreliable clowns",6
2024-05-11T19:22:03+00:00,"Don't let Rohit Sharma's 19 of 24 distract you from Hardik Pandya failing for the 100th time with the bat this season.
