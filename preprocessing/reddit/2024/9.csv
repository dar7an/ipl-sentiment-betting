2024-03-28T15:52:17+00:00,"The basic problem with a medium pacer who only has a yorker at the death is that they are way too predictable and have too little a margin of error to be consistently useful.

They might get away with it for a season or two in the IPL, but at a higher level of cricket for India, they will get found out against international teams long term.

Mukesh doesn't have enough pace or bounce to keep batters guessing once they get ahold of him.

It's the same reason that I didn't rate Natarajan as a long term T20I prospect even before his regular injuries, and why I understand MI benching Madhwal even after his mad season last year.

IPL teams have to think long term and pick quicker, younger Indian pacers and allow them to develop. Much easier to build variations when you already have the pace and bounce to make batters think twice.",2

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to sincerely apologize for my previous behavior on r/cricket, where I made fun of you. My actions were thoughtless and disrespectful, and I deeply regret the hurt and embarrassment it may have caused you.

I want to acknowledge that you are an incredibly talented cricketer with immense potential. Your dedication, skill, and passion for the game are truly admirable. It was wrong of me to make fun of you, and I now realize the impact my words can have on someone's feelings.

I understand how hurtful it can be to be on the receiving end of jokes and ridicule, especially in a public forum. I want to assure you that I have learned from this experience and will strive to be more mindful of my words and actions in the future.

Please accept my heartfelt apology for any pain I may have caused you. I genuinely admire your talent and wish you continued success in your cricketing journey. You deserve nothing but respect and support from fans like myself.

Thank you for taking the time to read this letter. I hope that you can find it in your heart to forgive me for my thoughtless behavior.

With sincere apologies,

2024-03-28T18:17:12+00:00,Hopefully DC will recover. I want them to do well for Rishabh Pant,1
2024-03-28T18:17:20+00:00,Wow Daredevils are on fire this season.,11
2024-03-28T18:17:23+00:00,Sanju is a very good bowlers' captain. A shame he will never captain India because he can't hold a consistent place in the team.,18
2024-03-28T18:17:39+00:00,"""this is just the beginning""

Goosebumps",11
2024-03-28T18:17:42+00:00,Pin drop silence what the fuck is this crowd,4
2024-03-28T18:17:44+00:00,_This is just the beginning_,15
2024-03-28T18:18:03+00:00,Riyan is so soft spoken,22
2024-03-28T18:18:22+00:00,Here we go,3
2024-03-28T18:18:36+00:00,"I'd like to thank me for being there for myself, love this energy. Rooting for this guy.",19
2024-03-28T18:19:06+00:00,"My boi Riyan has got charm and humility, really rooting for him to do well",15
2024-03-28T18:19:30+00:00,"Sanju and Parag are both so well spoken, gave me thala vibes",20
2024-03-28T18:19:31+00:00,This is an unreal transformation of Parag. The man has humbled down and is so much grounded this season. No rubbish talks and claims. Just comes and plays the game as per the situation,18
2024-03-28T18:19:46+00:00,"All the blue teams at bottom

Deserves for having similar color",23
2024-03-28T18:19:58+00:00,"What are these players doing in the DC side

1. Ricky Bhui
2. Sumit Kumar - did not bowl or bat

Why not replace with
1. Prithvi Shaw
2. Lalit Yadav",9
2024-03-28T18:20:10+00:00,"I cannot actually even imagine Sumit Kumar and Ricky Bhui performing based on the eye test.

Who exactly is in charge of selection at Delhi? We have exactly one indian batsman in Pant and even he has a big question mark post injury.",7
2024-03-28T18:20:28+00:00,Bro is talking like a proper grown up person. What a changeover from seeing him doing all the weird antics to this.,13
2024-03-28T18:21:01+00:00,"Why Robin uthappa is dressed up like a serial killer ? 

Only thing missing are black leather gloves",10
2024-03-28T18:22:16+00:00,"It was Ricky’s fault. Not Bhui, Ponting. Strategically they can be better.",8
2024-03-28T18:22:30+00:00,Wait I'm still writing my Parag apology,19
2024-03-28T18:22:37+00:00,great interviews! sanju and riyan are very well spoken,16
2024-03-28T18:23:42+00:00,"Shaw literally has to play because him coming off is literally Delhi’s only hope however slim.

The line up has to be:

Shaw
Warner
Marsh
Pant
Stubbs
Porel
Axar
Kuldeep
Khaleel
Nortje
Mukesh (impact sub bhui if you still still rate him)",15
2024-03-28T18:24:12+00:00,"DC has lot of NPC players sitting in the dug out 

Sumit , Bhui",21
2024-03-28T18:26:06+00:00,"Dc whole problem lies in their middle order, they don't have any clean hitter in the middle, bro how can you depend on pant to carry that hitting role when he's just coming back and definitely struggling to get going . If they don't have any options they can get Shaw in and shift marsh in middle order",16
2024-03-28T18:56:03+00:00,Rishabh would eventually be playing well. It takes time for the body to get used to this rigour after that much trauma. It might not be good for DC but I am hoping that he would be ready in time for the Indian team. I want that Rishabh starts to play in that way that he used to by the time the Indian team goes to Australia during the end of this year.,21
2024-03-28T19:29:33+00:00,"How can they not try Prithvi Shaw? The guy can be explosive on his day. You can’t bench him at the beginning itself, and bring him in 6th match after losing 5 and put immense pressure on him immediately",18
2024-03-28T19:42:42+00:00,"Best part with RR is they are sticking to defined roles. A lesser captain would be tempted to use Boult’s experience, Burger’s Speed or Chahal’s guile in the last 2 overs but Sanju said these are the guys who are in the team to bowl the death overs and let them do their jobs well.",17
2024-03-28T23:01:31+00:00,Riyan parag's coming of age . What a knock,7
