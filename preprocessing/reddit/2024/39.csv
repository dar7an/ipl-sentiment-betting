Super powers.

You can give super powers to any one of your players

1. Like Bumrah can now bowl 6 overs and 2 of them can be consecutive.

2. Any 1 tip 1 hand catch made by Faf Du Plesis will be out 

3. Virat get's to bat twice but left handed the second time.

4. Sunil Narine can chuck

5. If MSD walks out to bat in the last over the game is now 21 overs.

6. Chest high bumpers are a no ball for Shreyas Iyer.

7. SKY can only hit 120 degrees in front of the wicket

8. Crowd catches count as out for Mo Siraj

Yes, I do realize that T20Is will have better overall bowling attacks with bowlers who actually have a brain in their skulls; but we play 3 sub-par teams in the 1st round of the tournament. Dube might still not be seen as bankable against the Pakistan pacers, but there's high chance that he will take down bowling attacks of Ireland, Canada, and USA.

And apart from those sureshot Ws, it'll just be a bonus if je does go well against Pakistan & the 2nd round teams. By that time, if he has consistently fired, he will have that confidence & momentum needed to possibly tear down better attacks.

We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him tighten his ass as he chops wood, shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Marcus. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. 

Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love.",7

2024-04-23T18:27:46+00:00,I really hope this doesn‚Äôt induce us to include him in the T20 World Cup plans. The guy completely fucks it up every time it matters.,11
2024-04-23T18:28:31+00:00,"Stoinis is so class.

Already at such a young age he is talking about giving over to youngsters.",23
2024-04-23T18:28:37+00:00,"I couldn't hit boundaries at one point, to pathirana basically 

How honest they are man, wish our players were this honest at giving others credit and clarifying their inabilities.",21
2024-04-23T18:28:42+00:00,"Harsha man wtf is wrong with you.

2024-04-23T18:29:54+00:00,"Harsha could never ask tough questions to the Indian stars.
Glad Stoinis showed humility and honesty. 
Harsha probably thought he came off funny.",32

2024-04-23T18:32:34+00:00,GG might have got it wrong by buying Starc but he certainly got it spot-on by getting rid of Lockie and Shardul.,21

2024-04-23T18:36:02+00:00,Padikkal and Starc are the rare players that peaked in RCB and became shit after leaving them¬†,25
2024-04-23T18:40:35+00:00,"Anyone who knows ball will know that CKS will easily clap RR and SRH. Their hardest matches will be Punjab(one win confirmed), GT and finally against RCB to qualify.",1
2024-04-23T18:42:17+00:00,"I hope from next game on, LSG plays Arshin Kulkarni. LSG peeps, he is your Ashutosh Sharma / Abdul Samad. That quick fire 25 (10) kinda guy. Give him 2-3 games, some game time and time to settle. He will come good. Not Lolikkal",15
2024-04-23T18:43:21+00:00,2 years ago we chased 211 against csk at brabourne. That game was even better. Today was just a replay,27
2024-04-23T18:44:10+00:00,The reason CSK lost today was because they took Kl Rahul‚Äôs wicket too early.,13

2024-04-23T19:28:46+00:00,"The hero worshipping culture is prevalent all over India but in south India it's on another level.






Recently one guy in Chennai spent around Rs 60,000 to meet Dhoni when his daughter's school fees wasn't paid for months.




Another guy in tamil nadu, who was a Kohli/RCB fan murdered a guy who was talking ill about Kohli/RCB.






And no it's not only limited to cricketers. They worship all kinds of celebrities down south.






I remember in 2016 when Rajnikant's movie Kabali was released, in the first show around 3-4 am in the morning people were showering his photo with milk/coconut water and were like literally worshipping him.






In 2014 when Jailalita was sentenced to prison around 10 people in Tamil Nadu commited suicide. In 2016 when she passed away, people were crying beating their chest. This time the suicide number was 70+........you can imagine....








You won't see these things happening in rest of India. South India is next level in hero worshipping.",38
2024-04-23T21:50:22+00:00,"Now even Stoinis is in form, once Starc gets in form or is rested for the BGT and we open with Behrendoff, this squad is pretty much complete. I‚Äôd like to also see Tim David finish a couple of games",18
