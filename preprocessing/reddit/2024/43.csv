So yeah IPL ≠ T20i . Below 200 is still the norm in international t20s. People watch porn and think that this is what real sex looks like. Similarly BCCI is serving batting porn for entertainment purpose. Watch and enjoy. But don't think that this is what international cricket looks like.",7

Hey JFM My Love ,

I hope this letter doesn't catch you off guard, but I just couldn't resist letting you know how much of a crush I have on you. From your sexy hair to that killer batting stance, you've got me swooning every time you're on the field.

Seriously, those shots you play? They're like poetry in motion. And let's not even get started on your fitness – I mean, have you looked in the mirror lately? *Sigh*.

But it's not just about the cricket, you know? There's something about your confidence and charisma that drives me wild. You've got that irresistible charm that makes me want to watch every match, just hoping to catch a glimpse of you.

So yeah, consider this letter a declaration of my admiration for you, both on and off the field. Keep doing what you're doing, because you've definitely got a fan in me – and maybe a little more than just a fan, if you catch my drift.

Looking forward to seeing you dominate the game (and maybe a few hearts) in the future.

All the best My love",5

Hey JFM My Love,

I hope this doesn't come across as too forward, but I've got a major crush on you. Your hair, your stance, those shots – they all make me weak in the knees.

Seriously, watching you play cricket is like watching a seduction in action. The way you handle that bat... let's just say it's got my imagination running wild.

And don't even get me started on your fitness. You're like a Greek god out there on the field, and I can't help but imagine what else you could do with all that strength and stamina.

But it's not just about the game for me. There's something about your confidence and swagger that's downright irresistible. You've got this magnetic charm that draws me in every time I see you on TV.

So here's me, putting it all out there – I've got a thing for you, JFM. Keep doing what you're doing, because you've definitely got a fan who's more than just a little bit obsessed.",2

2024-04-27T12:49:19+00:00,Another thing that is there is that the quality that the bowling attacks have has definitely downgraded compared to what it was a couple of years back. It is especially true about Indian fast bowlers. We don't have fast bowlers that are good enough to enter into a national team and the larger number of teams means that the thin fast bowling talent that we have has been further diluted for each team. There are a lot of teams whose best Indian fast bowler is a guy that is significantly far away from entering into the Indian team.,1

2024-04-27T13:39:24+00:00,"Lucknow Super Giants (Playing XI): Quinton de Kock, KL Rahul(w/c), Marcus Stoinis, Deepak Hooda, Nicholas Pooran, Ayush Badoni, Krunal Pandya, Matt Henry, Ravi Bishnoi, Mohsin Khan, Yash Thakur

KL Rahul - The wicket is good, there's not much dew in Lucknow and the wicket will play well for the entire 40 overs. We'll need to play some good cricket. It's nice to get past 200, every team would like to do so, but the dimensions of this ground favours the bowlers a bit more and we've enjoyed it. No changes for us. Every player goes through a bit of time like that when you can't get runs ( asked about Padikkal's form). He looks good in the nets and he'll have to stay positive, you saw last night when Jonny came back after getting dropped and then getting a hundred.


Hmm no Mayank",3

2024-04-27T13:48:59+00:00,Hardik the captain in GT was more flexible with his batting and was actually free. In a star studded MI line if he decides to come 2 down he will eat up Tilak's spot. If he comes down 1 down then it will make Surya look weak. MI were getting comfortable with Green and have only dug their own grave. It's fun to watch nonetheless from entertainment perspective with the drama it provides.,3
2024-04-27T13:49:01+00:00,Why is so much discussion happening when RRR is 18. You pretty much need to go every over 😅,3
