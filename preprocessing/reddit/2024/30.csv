2024-04-15T14:05:47+00:00,I think RCB‚Äôs logic with this lineup is we‚Äôve two overseas bowlers so bowling quality will be better.

2024-04-15T14:40:49+00:00,"I love the way they go after the early runs. Those first few powerplay overs are so often underutilised in my opinion. 2 out, hard ball and almost exclusively quick bowlers, there's a massive opportunity to really score a lot and it's worth burning a wicket taking that on. Travis Head isn't going to come off all the time, but he's smart enough to take on the areas where there are no deep fielders and has the skill to carry the plan out. I think more teams should explore this option of at least one batter being hyper aggressive early. They do it late when the field is back and the ball is soft, why not take the risk earlier too?",3

2024-04-15T15:02:28+00:00,"In the heart of the stands, where dreams collide,
There's a fan whose passion never subsides.
For the team that falters, stumbles, and falls,
Yet he stands unwavering, through stadium walls.

With each match, hope flickers, then dies,
But he returns, fueled by love, not lies.
Through seasons of sorrow, he bears the pain,
For his loyalty to the team will never wane.

They're the underdogs, the butt of jokes,
But in his heart, they're the ones he invokes.
For it's not about glory, or trophies gleaming bright,
But the bond with his team, through every fight.

Through losses aplenty, and victories few,
He stands by them, through and through.
For it's not just a team; it's his passion, his creed,
In the world of ipl, it's all he'll ever need.

So here's to the fan who stays true,

Like even Jinks can justify his position and thrive in CSK, certainly someone with quality of Kohli can be used to win matches. But not with RCB tho, RCB have no philosophy neither any strategy or plan. They are all headless chickens relying on individual flashes of brilliance.

He claimed that the balls in international tournaments swing, seam, and spin much better - probably because of the balls being straight from factory and not stored in a godown - and this is why bowlers like Shami are so deadly there compared to in leagues and bilaterals. This is also likely why lots of IPL performers fail in big international tournaments.

Cricket is a contest between batters and bowlers. What we are seeing is an catastrophically one sided domination of batters over bowlers. Seeing it once in a while is fun but it's so fucking boring seeing it every second day.

Then you have games like this that just go bang bang bang from the start with basically no buildup whatsoever. I guess in the end it depends which you're more tolerable with but T20 is most enjoyable when a balance is struck between the non-stop boundary hitting and unconsented test match footage, a balance almost impossible to strike",11
2024-04-15T17:58:08+00:00,"Srh bowling is terrible, they'll be exposed against good bowling either rr or CSK . Overall usual pitches this ipl . No help for bowlers on these pitches. Hopeless. Batting can win you games but bowling will win you tournaments.",15

Fucking farcical, the amount of runs scored in a game.¬†


As a former bowler, this feels like the end of an era for me. Bowlers beig made redundant due to matchbox grounds and pitches that are as flatter than flat is painful to watch.


If this is the direction cricket is going, i will stick to football.",35

RR are in almost strong position to book their playoff spot

KKR need  more solid wins

Us and SRH need to continue the current form for quite a while

LSG and GT need to work harder and snatch bigger victories.

PBKS being PBKS 

MI future uncertain

Surely you could add more suspense to that after waiting 15 minutes after the match ended for the PotM",15
2024-04-15T18:04:04+00:00,The impact player rule needs to be taken out of the IPL in time for the mega auction next year. This is just making an already batting-centric game more batting-friendly and could create a dearth of quality all-rounders in Indian cricket. The pitches have to improve but the rules need to be more restrictive of run-scoring otherwise there‚Äôs no spectacle to the big sixes if it becomes the norm.,36
