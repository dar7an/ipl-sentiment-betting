2023-05-22T01:12:23+00:00,"In the rain-soaked city of Bangalore, the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) found themselves in a nerve-wracking battle against the Gujarat Titans (GT). The match carried immense weight for RCB as they needed a win to secure their spot in the playoffs. However, the rain threatened to wash away their hopes and introduce a twist of fate.  
  
Dark clouds loomed overhead as the players took the field. Adrenaline coursed through the veins of RCB's fans, including Arjun, who anxiously watched the proceedings. The rain started to fall steadily, adding an extra layer of tension to the already high-stakes encounter.  
  
As the overs progressed, the heavens opened up, transforming the pitch into a wet and slippery battlefield. The umpires called for the covers, and the players retreated to the dressing room, leaving the fate of the match hanging in the balance.  
  
Time ticked by as the rain continued to pour relentlessly. Arjun anxiously checked the Duckworth-Lewis (D/L) method calculations, realizing that if at least five overs were bowled, a revised target could be set for RCB based on the run rate.  
  
After a seemingly eternal wait, the rain eased up, and the umpires decided to resume the match. Five overs had been completed, and the D/L method came into play, recalculating the target for RCB. The revised total appeared on the scoreboard, raising hopes for a thrilling comeback.  
  
RCB's batsmen took to the field with renewed determination, aware of the urgency to score quickly. Every run became crucial in their pursuit of victory. The crowd roared with anticipation, their collective energy fueling RCB's resolve.  
  
As the innings progressed, RCB's batsmen unleashed a flurry of boundaries, skillfully manipulating the damp conditions to their advantage. The rain became an unpredictable ally, as the GT struggled to adapt to the changing dynamics of the match.  
  
With each passing ball, RCB inched closer to the revised target. The tension in the stadium reached its peak, with every run eliciting thunderous applause and nervous whispers. Arjun's heart pounded in sync with the unfolding drama, hoping for a miraculous turnaround.  
  
In a thrilling climax, RCB's batsman struck a towering six on the final ball, sealing the victory and sparking jubilant celebrations in the stands. The rain, which had threatened to dampen their spirits, instead became a symbol of triumph, washing away their worries and propelling RCB into the playoffs.  
  
Arjun joined the chorus of ecstatic fans, their voices rising above the rain-soaked stadium. RCB had defied the odds, emerging victorious against all odds. The rain, once a source of concern, had become a part of their triumphant narrative, etching a thrilling chapter in the annals of cricketing history.  
  
As the raindrops continued to fall, Arjun marveled at the unpredictability of the game, where a downpour could transform despair into elation. RCB had secured their place in the playoffs, thanks to the resilience of their players and the unrelenting spirit of the game itself.",8

2023-05-22T01:24:54+00:00,"Dear Rain,

  


You swine. You pusillanimous pustule. You vulgar little maggot. You worthless bag of filth. I wager you couldn't empty a boot of excrement were the instructions on the heel. You are a canker. A sore that won't go away. I would rather kiss a lawyer than be seen with you. Try to edit your responses of unnecessary material before attempting to impress us with your insight. The evidence that you are a nincompoop will still be available to readers, but they will be able to access it more rapidly.

  


You snail-skulled little rabbit. Would that a hawk pick you up, drive its beak into your brain, and upon finding it rancid set you loose to fly briefly before spattering the ocean rocks with the frothy pink shame of your ignoble blood. May you choke on the queasy, convulsing nausea of your own trite, foolish beliefs. You are weary, stale, flat and unprofitable. You are grimy, squalid, nasty and profane. You are foul and disgusting. You're a fool, an ignoramus.

  


And what meaning do you expect your delusional self-important statements of unknowing, inexperienced opinion to have to us who think and reason? What fantasy do you hold that you would believe that your tiny-fisted tantrums would have more weight than that of a leprous desert rat, spinning rabidly in a circle, waiting for the bite of the snake? You are a waste of flesh.

  


You have no rhythm. You are ridiculous and obnoxious. You are the moral equivalent of a leech. You are a living emptiness, a meaningless void. You are sour and senile. You are a disease, you puerile one-handed slack-jawed , drooling meatslapper. You smarmy lagerlout git. You bloody woofter sod. Bugger off, pillock. You grotty wanking oik artless base-court apple-john. You clouted boggish foot-licking twit. You dankish clack-dish plonker. You gormless crook-pated tosser. You churlish boil-brained clotpole ponce. You cockered bum-bailey poofter. You gob-kissing gleeking flap-mouthed coxcomb. You dread-bolted fobbing beef-witted clapper-clawed flirt-gill.

  


You are a fiend and a coward, and you have bad breath. You are degenerate, noxious and depraved. I feel debased just for knowing you exist. I despise everything about you, and I wish you would go away. I cannot believe how incredibly stupid you are. I mean rock-hard stupid. Dehydrated-rock-hard stupid. Stupid so stupid that it goes way beyond the stupid we know into a whole different dimension of stupid. You are trans-stupid stupid. Meta-stupid. Some pure essence of a stupid so uncontaminated by anything else as to be beyond the laws of physics that we know. I'm sorry. I can't go on.

  


This is an epiphany of stupid for me. After this, you may not hear from me again for a while. I don't have enough strength left to deride your ignorant questions and half-baked comments about unimportant trivia, or any of the rest of this drivel. Duh. I mean, really, stringing together a bunch of insults among a load of babbling was hardly effective.

  


True, these are rudimentary skills that many of us ""normal"" people take for granted that everyone has an easy time of mastering. But we sometimes forget that there are ""challenged"" persons in this world who find these things more difficult. If I had known, that this was your case then I would have never read your post. It just wouldn't have been ""right"". Sort of like parking in a handicap space. I wish you the best of luck in the emotional, and social struggles that seem to be placing such a demand on you.

  


You're an idiot. A moron of the highest order. You're so stupid it's a wonder and a pity you can remember to breath. Intelligent ideas bounce off your head as if it were coated with teflon. Creative thoughts take alternate transportation in order to avoid even being in the same state as you. If you had an original thought it would die of loneliness before the hour was out. On an intelligence scale of 1 to 10 (10 corresponding to the highest attainable IQ) you're rating is so far into negative numbers that one would need to travel into another quantum reality in order to even catch a distant glimpse of it.

  


Your personality is that of a rabid Chihuahua intent on destroying its own tail. Your powers of observation are akin to those of the bird that keeps slamming into the picture window trying to get that other bird it keeps seeing. You are walking, talking proof that you don't have to be sentient to survive, and that Barnum was thinking of you when he uttered his immortal phrase regarding the birth of a sucker. You are, at varying times, tedious, boring, and even occasionally earth shatteringly hilarious in your idiocy, routinely childish, moronic, pathetic, wretched, disgusting and pitiful.

  


You are wholly without any redeeming social grace or value. If God ever decides to give the planet an enema you'd better run like the wind because anywhere you stand is a suitable place for The Insertion. There is no animal so disgusting, so vile that it deserves comparison to you, for even the lowest, dirtiest, most parasitic member of the animal kingdom fills an ecological niche. You fill no niche. To call you a parasite would be injurious and defamatory to the thousands of honest parasitic species. You are worse than vermin, for vermin do not pretend to be what it is not. You are truly human garbage. You are a fraudulent, lying, predatory charlatan. You are of less worth than a burnt-out light bulb. You will forever live in shame.

  


You have nothing to say, and Godwin's Law does not apply when writing about you. You are the anti-Midas, for all that you touch becomes valueless and unusable. Mothers gather their children close when you appear. You are an aberration, a corruption, and a boil that needs to be lanced. You are a poison in need of being vomited. You are a tooth so rotten it infects the whole body. You are sperm that should have been captured in a condom and flushed down a toilet.

  


I don't like you. I don't like anybody who has as little respect for others as you do. Go away, you swine. You're a putrescent mass, a walking vomit. You are a spineless little worm deserving nothing but the profoundest contempt. You are a jerk, a cad, and a weasel. Your life is a monument to stupidity. You are a stench, a revulsion, a big suck on a sour lemon. You are a curdled staggering mutant dwarf smeared richly with the effluvia and offal accompanying your alleged birth into this world. Meaningful to no one, abandoned by the puke-drooling, giggling beasts that sired you and then killed themselves in recognition of what they had done.

  


I will never get over the embarrassment of belonging to the same species as you. You are a monster, an ogre, a malformity. I wretch at the very thought of you. You have all the appeal of a paper cut. Lepers avoid you. You are vile, worthless, less than nothing. You are a weed, a fungus, and the dregs of this earth. And did I mention you smell? Monkeys look down on you. Even sheep won't have sex with you. You are unreservedly pathetic, starved for attention, and lost in a land that reality forgot. You are a waste of flesh. On a good day you're a halfwit. You are deficient in all that lends character. You have the personality of wallpaper. You are dank and filthy. You are asinine and benighted. You are the source of all unpleasantness. You spread misery and sorrow wherever you go.

  


You are a fiend and a coward, and you have bad breath. You are degenerate, noxious and depraved. I feel debased just for knowing you exist. I despise everything about you, and I wish you would go away. I cannot believe how incredibly stupid you are. The only thing worse than your logic is your manners. Maybe later in life, after you have learned to read, write, study, spell, and count, you will have more success. True, these are rudimentary skills that many of us ""normal"" people take for granted that everyone has an easy time of mastering. It just wouldn't have been ""right"". Sort of like parking in a handicap space. I wish you the best of luck in the emotional, and social struggles that seem to be placing such a demand on you.

With the weather gods keeping fans on their toes, the possibility of the Duckworth-Lewis (D/L) method coming into play has led to an unexpected rush for calculators among RCB supporters.  
  
Local stores witnessed an unprecedented surge of RCB fans, all in desperate need of calculators to crack the enigmatic D/L code. People lined up outside shops, patiently waiting for their turn to purchase this newfound cricketing accessory.  
  
Rajiv, an RCB die-hard, was seen eagerly clutching his brand-new calculator. ""Who would have thought that a calculator would become the hottest item in town?"" he chuckled. ""Forget about the latest gadgets or fashion trends—calculators are where the real action is!""  
  
The city's calculator frenzy has become the talk of the town, with citizens swapping jokes and memes about the sudden rise of amateur mathematicians. Social media platforms are flooded with hilarious posts featuring RCB fans juggling calculators as if they were the key to unlocking victory.  
  
Pictures of long queues outside stores, accompanied by witty captions like ""Crunching numbers like never before!"" and ""Calculators: the ultimate power play,"" have garnered thousands of likes and shares, showcasing Bangaloreans' sense of humor even in the face of cricketing uncertainty.  
  
Local colleges and universities have reported a surge in calculator-related discussions among students. The campus canteens have become impromptu classrooms, with professors substituting their lectures for spontaneous D/L masterclasses. One professor even remarked, ""I never thought I'd see the day when my students would be so enthusiastic about math. Cricket really brings out the hidden equations!""  
  
Local businesses have capitalized on the calculator craze, offering special promotions to attract RCB fans. ""Calculator Happy Hour"" at cafes, where patrons can avail discounts by displaying their calculators, has become a new phenomenon. Even restaurants have jumped on the bandwagon, serving dishes with names like ""Boundary Bonanza"" and ""Calculator Cruncher"" to satiate the appetites of the cricket-crazy crowd.  
  
While experts claim that the D/L method is a complex algorithm, Bangaloreans have taken it upon themselves to solve the equation of victory. The enthusiasm for calculators showcases the city's undying spirit of innovation, finding humor even in the face of uncertainty.  
  
As the match approaches, one thing is clear: Bangaloreans are ready to cheer on their favorite team armed with calculators, raincoats, and a whole lot of laughter. Whether the calculators prove to be the ultimate lucky charm or merely a hilarious side effect of cricket fever, one thing's for sure—Bangalore is all set to witness a truly unforgettable cricketing spectacle.",15

2023-05-22T01:35:36+00:00,"Bangalore, India - As the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) gear up for their highly anticipated match against an equally formidable opponent, the Gujarat Titans (GT), fans in Bangalore are showcasing their quirky side with a flurry of hilarious superstitions.  
  
From wearing their lucky RCB jerseys inside out to drinking tea with a teaspoon placed on their heads, RCB fans are leaving no stone unturned in their quest to bring good luck to their beloved team.  
  
At a local sports bar, groups of RCB enthusiasts were spotted arranging their snacks in a precise pattern, believing it would translate into maximum boundaries on the field. Plates piled high with nachos and wings formed intricate formations, resembling an RCB logo or the iconic Virat Kohli beard.  
  
Pradeep, a die-hard RCB fan, proudly showed off his ""superstitious kit"" filled with an array of good luck charms. ""I've got my lucky socks, a miniature RCB helmet, and even a jar of cricket-shaped gummy bears,"" he exclaimed. ""These superstitions might seem silly to others, but they've never let me down before!""  
  
In an attempt to summon divine intervention, fans have even taken to creating unique rituals at home. From chanting prayers to the cricketing deities every time RCB takes a wicket to performing synchronized dances in front of their television screens during crucial overs, the enthusiasm knows no bounds.  
  
Social media platforms are buzzing with posts featuring fans engaging in peculiar rituals. Videos of supporters doing the ""RCB Rain Dance"" or dressing up their pets in miniature RCB jerseys have gone viral, eliciting a mix of laughter and admiration from the cricket-loving community.  
  
Local businesses have seized the opportunity to cater to the fans' quirky beliefs. Several vendors have started selling ""RCB Lucky Charms,"" ranging from four-leaf clover keychains to personalized cricket bat-shaped pendants. The demand for these items has skyrocketed, as fans desperately try to enhance their chances of witnessing an RCB victory.  
  
While skeptics may scoff at these antics, RCB fans have embraced the superstitions with open arms, finding solace in the idea that they can contribute to the team's success from the comfort of their living rooms.  
  
As the match kicks off, the stadium becomes a colorful spectacle with fans decked out in a rainbow of RCB merchandise. From oversized wigs to face paint, each fan brings their own unique touch to the vibrant mosaic of support.  
  
So, as the RCB faithful gather around their screens, ready to cheer their team on, they do so with a twinkle in their eyes and a pocketful of superstitions. After all, in the world of cricket, anything can happen, and sometimes, a little bit of laughter, belief, and a teaspoon on the head might just be the secret ingredients to an unforgettable RCB victory.",9

If we win, they leave us and never come back. The distant star team has all the advancements in bowling with their advanced technology. They can do more than seam/swing. They can bowl at 200kph. The game day happens and while all the batsmen choke in team eaeth, Virat Kohli manages to score 300 runs in a 50 over game. The distant star team loses.

GT should abandon their 2 batters to get this an even contest then also we have leaky taps named Vyshak and Harshal",4
2023-05-22T04:48:43+00:00,"There is misconception that ball will spin more if you pitch it short because it has to travel more distance after pitching provided if you put same number of revolutions than the fuller ball.

But it's wrong, there will be more dip and spin if it's in the air more time. That's why leggies when they try to spin the ball always err on the fuller side (e.g. Kuldeep and chahal).

There are some exceptions to this when the pitch is very dry and you get a lot of help from the pitch, you should just pitch the ball and let the pitch do it's thing. Jadeja is an expert at this, he is not a big turner of the ball.

He just doesn't really put a lot of effort to impart spin on the ball, but rather puts the effort to drift the ball in on the length and at the stumps and let the pitch do it's thing.

With pitches constantly getting worse in the test matches, he would be a great option. But wouldn't be in say a limited overs game on a flat wicket.


Anyway, today this guy himanshu with no real cricket match experience whatsoever is facing the same issue. He will get a lot of turn because of his wrist, but is he bowling too full. Should've played him earlier to get his lengths sorted.

Unfair on him to get him to bowl his first spell in high level competitive cricket at chinnaswamy.",2

2023-05-22T05:02:46+00:00,What strategy RCB had before auctions is beyond me? They had no decent spinner. And the bar wasn't even that high to begin with. Legin any decent Indian spinner would have worked. LSG and MI made it happen with Piyush Chawla and Mishra. GT found Noor Ahmed outta nowhere and there's this clown team which has Lomror and Karn Sharma. You gotta have decent reliable spinners man. Even CSK looks average as fuck when their spinners get fucked.,3

Gill played at a 240 run inning rate (200), which means he is in fact covering up for others' lower rate.

With 6-8 batters who can all hit sixes, it makes no sense not to hit-out-or-get-out towards the end. Anuj Rawat hitting a six when Kohli was cursing him for not coming back for 2 was an absolute statement.

As a long time Kohli fan, it pains to say this, but on good 200+ wickets, he is a liability if he can't keep up the strike rate, whether he gets a 100 or not.",5

Yes he batted with very less SR but you got to take into consideration the fact that wickets kept falling around him and given the weak RCB middle order, he needed to keep himself not out to give RCB some score on the board. 

If he got out, the next batsmen were RCB's bowlers. 

Whereas with Gill, obviously a great innings without a doubt and yes better than Kohli but he had the cushion of  a strong GT middle order and that's the reason why he could play more freely",14

2023-05-22T06:15:29+00:00,"16 seasons & still RCB haven’t figured the main issue with them - Lack of Indian talent.

They have had superstars every season, which I believe is great for popularity & money that it brings for RCB owners. 

But in order to win they need to scout for better talent and nurture it.

I don’t think I can even name 5 uncapped RCB players that went on to create an impact internationally.

There’s a stat that kinda sums up the whole lack of local talent point. 

After VK, Dravid & Paddikal come on the list of highest Indian run scorers for RCB",24
