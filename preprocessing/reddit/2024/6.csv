2024-03-25T15:25:49+00:00,"The blue jay Shah (Cyanocitta cristata Shah) is a passerine nepo baby in the family Corvidae, native to India. It lives in most of the eastern and central United States; some eastern populations may be migratory. Resident populations are also in Newfoundland, Canada; breeding populations are found across southern Canada. It breeds in both deciduous and coniferous forests, and is common in residential areas. Its coloration is predominantly blue, with a white chest and underparts, and a blue crest; it has a black, U-shaped collar around its neck and a black border behind the crest. Males and females are similar in size and plumage, and plumage does not vary throughout the year. Four subspecies have been recognized, each of which write their own scripts.

The blue Jay Shah feeds mainly on seeds and nuts, such as acorns, which it may hide to eat later;[2] soft fruits; arthropods; occasionally small vertebrates; and IPL fan tears. It typically gleans food from trees, shrubs, and the ground, and sometimes hawks insects from the air. Blue jay Shahs can be very aggressive to other birds; they sometimes raid nests and have even been found to have decapitated other birds.[3]

It builds an open cup nest in the branches of a tree; both sexes participate. The clutch may be two to seven eggs, which are blueish or light brown with darker brown spots. Young are altricial, and are brooded by the female for 8‚Äì12 days after hatching. They may stay with their parents for one to two months.

The name Jay derives from the nepo baby's noisy, garrulous nature and has been applied to other birds of the same family, which are also mostly gregarious.[4] Jay Shahs are also called jaybirds.[5]",1

Eventually, tragedy will strike when one of us passes away, leaving the other to face the unbearable solitude.

2024-03-25T18:08:20+00:00,ICT selectors only after 5-6 games of IPL- *panik* ![img](emote|t5_2qhe0|21267),24
2024-03-25T18:08:58+00:00,Get this man a wc,31
2024-03-25T18:09:06+00:00,"You will forever have it in t20, Kohli",30

2024-03-25T18:09:31+00:00,Daaaaaammnnnn,14
2024-03-25T18:09:32+00:00,Well he said it indirectly fuck you to selectors,33
2024-03-25T18:09:32+00:00,"Why Dhawan is the most clueless captain:

Arshdeep 18th over

Dhawan walks up and asks him to try a bouncer

Fine leg inside, easy boundary

Harshal 19th over

Dhawan again walks up, Bouncer, deep fine leg inside, Hook shot and 6

Arshdeep 20th over

Every mfer who knows cricket knows DK will hit or try something behind the wickets, a ramp will come 

No fielder behind, DK does a ramp shot

I really don't blame the bowlers, Arshdeep was a beast under KL man, Dhawan is such a clown captain.",11
2024-03-25T18:09:38+00:00,"""Name is attached to promote the game in some parts of the world"" lmao",53
2024-03-25T18:09:40+00:00,Koach talking about his name being used for Olympics?,26
2024-03-25T18:09:45+00:00,He mentioned the brand thing lol. Didn't expect that.,42
2024-03-25T18:09:47+00:00,Koach: take this sheet selectors,27
2024-03-25T18:09:47+00:00,"""still got it I guess"". slap in the selectors face",47
2024-03-25T18:09:54+00:00,"Sly dig at who?

Agarkar or KP",17
2024-03-25T18:09:55+00:00,Bruh he still got it in the next WC most probably. Is there even a doubt,23
2024-03-25T18:09:58+00:00,"Zamnnn if he‚Äôs saying that, then it means the rumours were true.",55
2024-03-25T18:10:13+00:00,"Damn Virat saying he still got it is insane to listen to.
Fuckem who spread those rumours to drop him..",58
2024-03-25T18:10:20+00:00,He has definitely got it. He might have a trophy in him as well. I am talking about a trophy with the Indian team.,36
2024-03-25T18:10:32+00:00,Aww Kohli is so wholesome,18
2024-03-25T18:10:33+00:00,BRUHHH,13
2024-03-25T18:10:43+00:00,Man as much as it‚Äôs a cliche that Virat is the chase master but every single time it‚Äôs so satisfying seeing him pace his inning so beautifully.,41
2024-03-25T18:10:44+00:00,We desperately need a Koach podcast. He is such a shining figure of the game.,47
2024-03-25T18:10:53+00:00,IS THIS THE SPEECH OF 87'?,25
2024-03-25T18:10:59+00:00,Koach looks mad I love it,31

2024-03-25T18:11:22+00:00,Man it makes me SAD that this fucking man of all men has to come and defend himself. Jeez man people have really fucked up.,60
2024-03-25T18:11:26+00:00,Bro I was not prepared for such a hard ass interview,67

2024-03-25T18:11:39+00:00,Koach want to butt fuk selectors I can see into his eyes,37
2024-03-25T18:11:57+00:00,"Hahaha Virat with a little cheek there lol. 

Yep, he's still got it. If anyone's thinking of dropping him from the WC team",28
2024-03-25T18:12:20+00:00,Haha Kohli dancing :),17
2024-03-25T18:12:26+00:00,He's gone from mad guy to docile to mad but not visibly showing chill guy,26
2024-03-25T18:12:35+00:00,How can you hate this man! Brilliant Human,23
2024-03-25T18:12:47+00:00,"If they drop him, we riot",27
2024-03-25T18:12:58+00:00,He‚Äôs so charismatic lmaooo. I‚Äôm like blushing and shit.,32
2024-03-25T18:13:03+00:00,We have it to win the cup? üòå,9
2024-03-25T18:13:07+00:00,Chad harsha for asking the right questions. Chadder koach for answering with some spice.,59
2024-03-25T18:13:09+00:00,damn arshdeep is one of our(india's) better bowlers (after bumrah) in t20 world cup. not looking good to get tonked like this.,20
2024-03-25T18:13:46+00:00,Okay. One thing confirms it. Kohli ain't gonna retire from IPL in the near future . I see atleast 10 more season. Atleast till IPL 25. Imagine playing a league for 25 freaking years. Has that ever happened in like any other sport in elite level.,23
2024-03-25T18:13:56+00:00,bro casually telling every one that he is the master of the universe,30
2024-03-25T18:14:06+00:00,"Kohli can have all of my organs 


Becuase he still has fucking got it",25
2024-03-25T18:14:15+00:00,Lol VK saying ‚ÄúI think I still got it‚Äù hits hard üî•. Well played RCB.,62
2024-03-25T18:16:49+00:00,Keeping this aside...I found two packets of masala in my maggi..!!!,22
2024-03-25T18:17:13+00:00,"If one player's (who's extremely bad at playing T20 wc) place is fixed as a captain, then Kohli's is too..

Those are all fake. 

It's not like Rohit and Gill smash spin at 180 SR anyway.

If anyone's better than Virat currently it's Jaiswal.. And he should start the tournament as an opener.",31
2024-03-25T18:18:03+00:00,kohli ü´∂,18
2024-03-25T18:19:10+00:00,"Not relevant to this thread, but I realised we might noy get to see dhoni speak like this in a post match presentation this season",31
2024-03-25T18:19:56+00:00,"I think the question was never whether or not Kohli should be in the Indian T20 team. 

1) On slow, tough pitches send kohli at the top

2) Quick wicket falls, send Kohli 1 down

3) Chasing => send kohli 1 down

4) Setting a target on a belter => send the strike rate champs first send kohli down so he doesnt use as many balls to get going. Even if the strike rate champs fail you have a buffer to not collapse the innings.",36
2024-03-25T18:22:20+00:00,Is there no other place to get on a phone call than right in the middle of a stadium? Like every single time,14
2024-03-25T18:27:41+00:00,Ok keeping this aside ....if you suck your own meat...which feeling will be more intense sucking a meat ..or getting your meat sucked...,-43
2024-03-25T19:04:06+00:00,Kohli the GOAT always ü´∂,15
2024-03-25T19:35:07+00:00,Real impact of impact player was evident.,16
2024-03-25T21:15:06+00:00,This is your reminder that Arshdeep has somehow managed to regress by playing for India because he used to be an outstanding death bowler a few years back.,27
