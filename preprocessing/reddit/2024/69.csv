2024-05-19T22:12:37+00:00,Looks like we ain't going in top 2,3
2024-05-19T22:12:38+00:00,Third umpire would read the EKG of a guy who has been dead for 2 years and see a clear spike in heartrate,9
2024-05-19T22:12:39+00:00,Shashank time to bring the ex riser in you,1
2024-05-19T22:12:40+00:00,"That’s the static you get all the time, be it shoes moving on the ground or players shouting. No way that was a clear spike lmao",3

2024-05-19T22:12:51+00:00,Wasn't it pad first ? wtf,7
2024-05-19T22:12:51+00:00,Shashank used to play for srh in 2022,5
2024-05-19T22:12:54+00:00,Even if the ball hits the head there will be a spike.,3
2024-05-19T22:12:59+00:00,Deflection was surely from the forearm,7

2024-05-19T22:13:07+00:00,Another controversial decision,6
2024-05-19T22:13:08+00:00,That was the opposite of a clear spike,10
2024-05-19T22:13:14+00:00,"Oh get off it lads. I didn't think he hit it either, but even though it was minor, that was clearly grazing. The ultraedge flicker was slim because the glove and ball were travelling in the same direction.

Out is out, even for a millimetre.",16

2024-05-19T22:14:00+00:00,"Haha, commentators really thinking that big deflection is from glove, lol. That was from forearm.",4
2024-05-19T22:14:01+00:00,"That was a bold decision, many umpires would have written that murmur off as a noise.

But it did look like it hit the gloves on the first view and matched his naked eye observation with the murmur and gave it out.

Overall, I say it was correct.",1
2024-05-19T22:14:10+00:00,Fucker could bowl like that and he’s serving dollies,5
2024-05-19T22:14:16+00:00,so viyas can be a weapon when it starts spinning early hmm,7

2024-05-19T22:16:12+00:00,How could you not play a Rilee Rousseau for the whole tournament,1
2024-05-19T22:16:15+00:00,The 12 day gap really ended up screwing us over didn't it,6
2024-05-19T22:16:22+00:00,The fact that there's no Livi and Bairstow is the reason they're playing so well,2

2024-05-19T23:52:17+00:00,"Pat Cummins is such a pro. The delivery that got Russo out wicket was bowled with laser-guided precision. A slower full-toss with pin-pointed accuracy, just at the right height to lure into into a false shot. Superb skills.

Side note: Some of these players are getting a bomb for a salary. Take Starc for example, he got a season payout of INR 24 cr. To think that he'll just have to come out and bowl 24 delivers a game, one would expect each ball to be well thought of, expertly crafted and executed to perfection.

Some dizzying figures with Starc as an example:

If you consider Pre-playoff total.

Each team plays 14 matches. So that's 336 balls to be bowled in total, assuming he plays all the games.

Given that he got a INR 24cr payout. He gets a whopping INR 7,14,285/per delivery.

Full season total.

Add 8 more overs, so 384 balls in total.

Still, it's INR 6,25,000/ per delivery.

You've got to make EVERY DELIVERY count. No room for looseners. When you step out onto that field, you've got to be well-tuned, totally switched-on and ready to strike. And professionals have a tendency to deliver the goods. Probably the reason why they command such high valuations.",2
