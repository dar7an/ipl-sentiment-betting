They did it to Dan Christian\u2019s WIFE which was so gross.    \n\nBut, it\u2019s a subcontinent problem. RCB has more fans than let\u2019s say RR, so you\u2019ll see more toxicity in total from RCB. Just like how india has more population than Australia so you\u2019ll see more toxicity from Indian fans than Aussie.    \n\nIndian fans abused Dhoni and burnt effigies. Indians created an uproar when Harbhajan posed for an ad with a groomed/shaved beard. Indians pelted stones at ICT homes. Indians trolled Bumrah saying he only shows up for IPL and not for \u201cNational duty\u201d (cringe). Indians are booing hardik left-right knowing we don\u2019t have a single replacement for him, especially with what mugs our ICT pacers are with the bat. Dhoni fans act crazy on SM. They booed Jadeja and cheered for him to get out last year. Some Rohit stans are mad on Twitter, putting \u201cChokli\u201d down every opportunity they get. \n\nSo this is NOT an RCB problem. There\u2019s literally nothing different culturally about RCB fans than others. It\u2019s just strength in numbers in display.",
