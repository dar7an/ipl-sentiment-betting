                "body": "The blue jay Shah (Cyanocitta cristata Shah) is a passerine nepo baby in the family Corvidae, native to India. It lives in most of the eastern and central United States; some eastern populations may be migratory. Resident populations are also in Newfoundland, Canada; breeding populations are found across southern Canada. It breeds in both deciduous and coniferous forests, and is common in residential areas. Its coloration is predominantly blue, with a white chest and underparts, and a blue crest; it has a black, U-shaped collar around its neck and a black border behind the crest. Males and females are similar in size and plumage, and plumage does not vary throughout the year. Four subspecies have been recognized, each of which write their own scripts.\n\nThe blue Jay Shah feeds mainly on seeds and nuts, such as acorns, which it may hide to eat later;[2] soft fruits; arthropods; occasionally small vertebrates; and IPL fan tears. It typically gleans food from trees, shrubs, and the ground, and sometimes hawks insects from the air. Blue jay Shahs can be very aggressive to other birds; they sometimes raid nests and have even been found to have decapitated other birds.[3]\n\nIt builds an open cup nest in the branches of a tree; both sexes participate. The clutch may be two to seven eggs, which are blueish or light brown with darker brown spots. Young are altricial, and are brooded by the female for 8\u201312 days after hatching. They may stay with their parents for one to two months.\n\nThe name Jay derives from the nepo baby's noisy, garrulous nature and has been applied to other birds of the same family, which are also mostly gregarious.[4] Jay Shahs are also called jaybirds.[5]",

That means they can score 277 if they click but also fail in the very next game like we saw. \n\nIt's pitches like these that have made anchors irrelevant. If we had a balanced pitch, anchors would still be important. \n\nTeams like England, WI, even Australia to some extent have excellent batting depth which supports attacking cricket at all times regardless of loss of wickets. India, for all its resources and prowess, doesn't have that luxury. So they have to rely on assigning roles to players.

He's knocked him over! Andrew is screaming and trying to power up into a Super Saiyan, shouting \"Nah, I'd ~~win~~ take your wicket!\" at Arjun Jr as he slowly makes his way back to the pavilion.  Unfortunately, due to standard advertising rules, the folks following along at home won't know that a wicket has fallen until approximately 3 hours from now.
