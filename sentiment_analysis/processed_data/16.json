It's a home game for Delhi but will the support be overwhelmingly for them or will it be just mostly neutrals who want their favorite cricketers to do well? Or perhaps just 50-50 for DC and KKR. I don't know if anyone (well like a considerable amount) supports a team outside of their state (barring MI, CSK and RCB).",

Double especially since he's actually from Delhi.\n\nAlthough that need has been lessened quite a lot by how good Khaleel has been, great to see the strides he's made in becoming less floaty, quicker, and able to move the ball back into the right handers.",

If you can have a replay that later shows not out, what\u2019s the point of an umpire altogether? What does the out even mean? Umpires harm the game in this day and age hhaaa",

But I feel that everyone involved in Indian cricket, the fans and even Kohli himself - everyone is scared of Kohli getting out early, which makes sense to a degree, Kohli is very important. But it seems that sentiment weighs down on a potential heavy hitting and forces India to adopt an anchoring Kohli approach.\n\nIt is unfortunate because yes, it's risky but that's what t20 is about and winners are those who end up on the right side of that risk. India's approach will never work.\n\nAnd yes, I'm ignoring Rohit here. He's beyond useless in t20s.",

Suddenly people had forgotten this and were shagging to dot balls and maidens. Glad that the original vision is back today with the guy who terrorized biomechanics labs.",

                "comment": "The blue jay Shah (Cyanocitta cristata Shah) is a passerine nepo baby in the family Corvidae, native to India. It lives in most of the eastern and central United States; some eastern populations may be migratory. Resident populations are also in Newfoundland, Canada; breeding populations are found across southern Canada. It breeds in both deciduous and coniferous forests, and is common in residential areas. Its coloration is predominantly blue, with a white chest and underparts, and a blue crest; it has a black, U-shaped collar around its neck and a black border behind the crest. Males and females are similar in size and plumage, and plumage does not vary throughout the year. Four subspecies have been recognized, each of which write their own scripts.\n\nThe blue Jay Shah feeds mainly on seeds and nuts, such as acorns, which it may hide to eat later;[2] soft fruits; arthropods; occasionally small vertebrates; and IPL fan tears. It typically gleans food from trees, shrubs, and the ground, and sometimes hawks insects from the air. Blue jay Shahs can be very aggressive to other birds; they sometimes raid nests and have even been found to have decapitated other birds.[3]\n\nIt builds an open cup nest in the branches of a tree; both sexes participate. The clutch may be two to seven eggs, which are blueish or light brown with darker brown spots. Young are altricial, and are brooded by the female for 8\u201312 days after hatching. They may stay with their parents for one to two months.\n\nThe name Jay derives from the nepo baby's noisy, garrulous nature and has been applied to other birds of the same family, which are also mostly gregarious.[4] Jay Shahs are also called jaybirds.[5]",

That's a very long batting line-up. Not all teams have that luxury. \n\nSRH doesn't have a deep line-up and still play very attacking cricket. That means they can score 277 if they click but also fail in the very next game like we saw. \n\nIt's pitches like these that have made anchors irrelevant. If we had a balanced pitch, anchors would still be important. \n\nTeams like England, WI, even Australia to some extent have excellent batting depth which supports attacking cricket at all times regardless of loss of wickets. India, for all its resources and prowess, doesn't have that luxury. So they have to rely on assigning roles to players.

When questioned, the curator has been belligerent thereby removing a key component of the IPL - the home advantage.  \n  \nThere you go Ganguly, there\u2019s only so much you can do with backbiting and backroom politics. You couldn\u2019t keep Kohli down with it, happy to see another one of your ploys has come to bite you in the arse",

It's a game where a single wrong decision by umpire can potentially change the course of the match. In that case why not just delegate the job of deciding out/ not out entirely to technology. Umpires can remain on the ground just to ensure smooth conduct of the game. No umpires call drama, no leaning towards \"on field call\" when the third umpire doesn't have \"conclusive\" evidence to overturn. Just technology all the way through is better imo.",

Arjun Tendulkar Jr comes out to open the batting for India, his bat sporting stickers of Asuka from Evangelion and Makima from Chainsaw Man on the face and handle. A little vintage, but just like his father and grandfather, the littlest master pays respect to the classics. \n\nHe's got a tough job to do today - bit of a below par score put up by Australia, only 413 off their 20 overs, but the bowlers won't make this easy for him. \n\nSpeaking of bowlers, steaming in to open the bowling for Australia is Andrew Starc - Healy, who some of our keen cricket bloodline aficionado's will recognise as the grandchild of Mitchell Starc and Alyssa Healy, forced by Cricket Australia to marry into the McGrath bloodline to keep the bowling breeding stock pure. \n\nOh, he's done it! He's knocked him over! Andrew is screaming and trying to power up into a Super Saiyan, shouting \"Nah, I'd ~~win~~ take your wicket!\" at Arjun Jr as he slowly makes his way back to the pavilion.  Unfortunately, due to standard advertising rules, the folks following along at home won't know that a wicket has fallen until approximately 3 hours from now. What a ripper! \n\nit's 3am, I have work in 4 hours and i can't sleep, sue me",

The ball doesn't gather a lot of air, so Varun has to take the tough route of diving forward.
