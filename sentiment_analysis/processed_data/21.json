He used to 'touch' sixes, and then lost his hitting form. Sachin's ability to whack it also reduced over his career.

Life is unfair.  I just want to show KL and Mayank that they can still be good.  maybe, just maybe, there's still someone out there to help them regain their form that they haven't found.  Maybe we cricket fans are too impatient, and I haven't stopped to think if we should replace them with the next generation batters\u2026But...what if there isn't that person and i'm destined to blindly follow the likes of Abhishek Sharma and Riyan Parag?

We won't ever score boundaries, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand at the non-striker's end watching him tighten his ass as he solidly defends, helmetless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run when he calls and take guard, the entire time forcing myself to think of sixes while my thoughts drift back to dot balls. I won't be able to score and I'll eventually go back to being off strike, angry. Sometimes we will look across the wicket and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will be out, and the other will lead him outside the infield. Then he'll go back on strike, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and block six balls in a row, never able to deal with an innings without his one true platonic love.",
