Last year we saw a glimpse of this rule affecting the dynamics of IPl when MI despite having a shockingly poor bowling attack still made it to the playoffs due to sheer batting power. Usually bowling teams tend to win more matches in T20s because when you are a batting dominant side you have to be aggressive and make 20-30 runs more than the par score to make up for your bowling but in doing so you sacrifice consistency and get all out for 130 while trying to score 200. But due to cushion of the extra batter the impact sub offers teams are able to play aggressively without worrying because even if they collapse they have faith that the impact sub will rescue the collapse. So it's no longer a luxury to bat aggressively  it's a necessity. Look at SRH or KKR or RR their batting order is filled with hitters likd Head, Klaasen, Sharma, Dre Russ, Rinku, Narine, Buttler, Jaiswal, Hetmyer, Powell etc.  RCB in particular have struggled because they open with 2 anchors who are weak against spin so they don't have the ability to bat like Head or Klaasen.  The teams that have understood to use the impact sub well have done good this year.",

Shahbaz will probably be in the auction, for example. They can bat insanely deep, if 4 of their top 7 gives them 1 good spinner, 1 decent pacer, and 2 part time spinning options.

Pandya, who is overcompensating for his shitty performance thus far by grinning all the time for no apparent reason(even when he and his team have done poorly), and then there's Pant, who has not only made a phenomenal comeback as a batter but he's also kept the wickets like a dream, not to mention shouldering the added responsibility of being a captain. He's passed the acid test. Doubters can eat dirt. Meanwhile, Pandya needs a looooong vacation, probably get a couple more tattoos, and contemplate whether he really wants to be a cricketer or a fashion model.\n\nPS: Pant hasn't smiled nearly as much as Pandy although he now has every reason to. That's solid temperament for you right there. Welcome back Pant ji. The Indian team needs a wicketkeeper/batter with character like yourself. Happy to see you back in form again.
