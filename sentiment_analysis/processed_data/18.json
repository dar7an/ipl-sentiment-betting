It's good that you have given license to kill to Rachin but when he does get out in the first three over, which will happen a lot, you cannot send another anchor. Specially when you have a stacked batting line-up like CSK. You gotta send another power hitter who will swing at everything. If things do need to be anchored, you have one on the crease and he can hog the strike all he wants. Two anchors is just pathetic and kills the game in the starting only. Same happened last match, and same will happen in this match.",

That's why we are seeing 270s being scored with ease. Why be 46/0 after 6 overs when you an be 72/1 and just destroy the opposition mentally in first 6 overs itself?This is going to be the difference between scoring 180 in 20 overs vs ending up on 230 in 20 overs.
