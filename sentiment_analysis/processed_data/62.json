The third ball is a slower one by Ferguson, Shardul misses but DK fumbles the ball which results in THALA at the strikers end. \n\nTHALA HITS 3 SIXES IN A ROW KNOCKING RCB OUT OF THE TOURNAMENT AND CSK GO INTO THE PLAYOFFS.",

RCB needs to win by over 40 runs to maintain an NRR of +0.350. \n\n4. RCB must also defeat CSK by a margin of 40 runs in their next game. \n\n5. The smaller RCB's victory margin today, the larger it must be against CSK.\n\n6. If DC wins both matches and CSK loses to RCB, DC will qualify.\n\n7. SRH needs to win at least one of their remaining matches to qualify.\n\n8. LSG is also in the race of playoffs. \n\nRCB will be eliminated from IPL 2024 Playoffs if they lose tonight.",

Then they got axar in as captain when having a trophy winning guy sitting inside.  Narine chucks never being called out depite commentators brazenly joking about it. Pitches suddenly turning into landmines or the other way. Look, I'm not saying IPL is blatantly f*xed but there are few signs that the tournament is being gently nudged towards sensationalism and TRP through sus decisions inside and outside the stadium,",

Now, after 5000 years of that legendary match, Royal Challengers are regarded as the a GODS of choking by Hindus throughout the world.\n\nAs a religious man, I would like to end my legendary tale on the The Challenger of Bangalore and thank all cricket fans for this beautiful opportunity, Long Live The Royal Challenger.",
