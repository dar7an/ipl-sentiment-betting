Dube might still not be seen as bankable against the Pakistan pacers, but there's high chance that he will take down bowling attacks of Ireland, Canada, and USA.\n\nAnd apart from those sureshot Ws, it'll just be a bonus if je does go well against Pakistan & the 2nd round teams.

If you build a risk profile, I think letting them be in for about 20 balls is ideal. Then, get them out. It's ok, just like the stock market, you don't want to hold for too long and be stuck with bags on the way down. Take the profits of a struggling batter after 20 balls. It's 1/6 of the innings, gone. Paddikal has effectively killed the game for LSG here. 14 off 20 can become 20 off 29, yes, but it can also become 35 off 25 and then you get accused of \"bringing him into form\" and shit.
