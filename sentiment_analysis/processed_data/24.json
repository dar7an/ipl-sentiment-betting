The biggest reasons for RCB's loss were spinners which is the worst among all teams and team selection being other reason.",

Kishan's best and only bet is to bat against medium pace for three overs on a good flat track. \n\nIyer: Short balls, well. Trouble against swing. Can't really always build an innings against good spin, is a better bet against spin in the short formats where quick runs are important (better as a spin basher but not overall batter). Injury prone.\n\nPandya: Was a phenomenal hitter with very strong wrists, back swivel and arms. Since his injuries he's lost the hitting ability, batting is more robotic and less flexible, weak against back of the length and genuinely good spin; more of an anchor now, struggles to hit across the line. Injury prone.",

He displays remarkable composure and skill, patiently sitting on his dad's lap until called upon. With every word from his mouth, he moves toward being the greatest cricket administrator of all time. Out of everyone in the history of nepotism, I love Jay Shah.",

But bowling every ball fast is a borderline negative tactic.\n\nIt is similar to stacking the field on the leg side and bowling completely on the pads. It is the reason why we have the pitching outside leg rule.\n\nShould we have a rule limiting fast balls? Easier said than done.",

Koach didn't have to do that.\n\n2. Riyan still ended up with a higher Sr than koach. Had he played that extra 24 balls, he'd have comfortably surpassed kohli's score\n\n3. Riyan did not attempt ground shots in the 19th over. Koach played 3 ground shots for 2 runs in the 19th.\n\n4. Most importantly, you are comparing Kohli with Riyan lmfao. If you have to compare a titan to an uncapped player, then you are clutching at straws\n\nEdit: added another point",

                "comment": "FYI, not intending to criticize any players with this post. \n\n  \nI feel like people are missing the point a bit with parag and other guys in the indian lineup. Parag's innings at the 20 ball mark this season have been: 28(20), 16(20, 20(20), 22(20). There's been reason's for these slowish starts (rajistan opting for a more bowling focused side, early wickets coming in a clump often, etc). but I really don't see how this start to an innings approach is much different to the \"tuk tuk\" approach that partially cost india the 2022 t20 knockout vs england, and you see people on here getting so mad about. \n\n  \nIn that knockout game, hardik who walked out in a similar type of \"slower start, few early wickets, in a clump, rajastan style bowler at 7 type lineup\" and made 24(20) before going berserk and ending up making 63 at 190. Realistically, if parag plays for india at this WC, he doesn't replace SKY at 4, so he's going to bat 5 or at 3. I don't think parag playing a knock that's been typical to him this season really makes india's approach any different to the more conservation model that bit them in the WC knockout last time. If your going to make that kind of change, parag isn't likely going to be the player to do it, it's gonna be from a change in intent from the top 3 like we've seen from rohit this IPL. India can afford one kohli type 130-140 SR player at the top if they've got faster scorer's like jaiswal, sky, new model rohit and rinku around him. They can't afford more than one.",

Whole squad will lift Rohit on their shoulders, and right at that moment, Thala would cone running to cash in his Koyal in the Bank briefcase. Rohit would be absolutely clueless, Pandya would smirk while the whole stadium erupts with shock and joy. As Rohit sets his eyes on Thala, we would see Pathirana and Jaddu come from behind to give Rohit a low-blow only to throw him in front of Thala. Thala then lifts him on his shoulder and gives him a thunderous AA, and pins him 1 , 2 , 3 to capture the IPL trophy for one last time and retire as a 6 time champion while Rohit sits there in disbelief.\n\nAlthough we also see Jasprit Bumrah applying gel to a 16-inch dildo while he stares at Pandya.",
