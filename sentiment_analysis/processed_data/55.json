So many teams will be looking for a captain and would love to strengthen their bowling. I daresay Pant's captaincy has been a little lacking this year, and he will not have a problem giving it up to Bumrah to get him in the team. The possibilities are really exciting.

Our batting is just the so unreliable, and it sucks that Klassen never seems to deliver when we actually need it either. F  \n  \nFor a team that's supposed to be known for its batting, I get insanely nervous after we're about two down, exactly because of what's happening now, and that's not a good feeling esp when you compare it with the batting depth teams like RR and KKR. The collapses in the last 4-5 games have been very concerning, it never feels even remotely safe after 3 wickets fall. We need actual match-winners.
