Debutant has been brought into the team as a permanent keeper to replace DK. \n\nWould be a big call to drop anyone else for Lomror, but at this stage Patidar is on thin ice.",

But when you have a large pool, purely on a professional basis, it doesn't make sense to keep playing the same squad when you already have a fair sample size for assessment, even under the guise of 'experience' which clearly hasn't worked for years. \n\nThere's a good crop of players who can genuinely play T20, don't have the baggage of knockout losses (yet) and aren't intimidated. \n\nI know it won't happen because broadcasters and hero worshippers won't allow it, but this is a fact. \n\nSelectors have to braver and avoid being safe for once. The last time we did that, we actually won a T20 World Cup.",

This results in more risky cricket and more chances of dismissal. \n\nWhile our darling boy can think about taking off at over number 18 and have a nice little 140SR as the average.",

Everything about Klaasen's T20 setup, stance, backlift, swing is done in such a way that he is looking to hit the ball for a six. If he can't do that, he looks to rotate strike, and if not he can defend it.\n\nIn comparison, Kohli lunges forward and goes with his hands and looks to manipulate the balls into gaps. If he gets a really bad ball he will try and hit it for a boundary.\n\nNo amount of nudging and nurdling and running hard can make up for the very basic fact that 4s and 6s are worth more than 1s or 2s. Simple as that.",

Two straight balls where he should be trying to hit 6 and instead he's just tapping singles because he knows the hundred is coming. This has been a phenomenal innings, but there's been a clear shift in intent from the period between 95-99 to the ball he got his hundred off and after that. Who gives a fuck if you get out on 98, i'de rather you try and maximize every ball instead of playing for the milestone.",

Wonder what it would look like if they had 10+ balls to face? \ud83e\udd14",

They were all just kinda shit. Also what tf is wrong with this management, not sending out Dk or even lomror or ravat in the depth when they are clearly the team\u2019s best finishers in the depth. There is no rule in cricket that states you have to have a fixed batting order",

I also think that is precisely how a t20 opener should bat. 113* in 72 balls, just under 10 an over (9.4ish to be exact) against the best bowling unit in the league. He set a platform for others to get 30(10), 24(7), 12(4) etc - but no one did. \n\nAnyway, now I have finished dickriding, if RCB lose (as I write this now RR are 54-1 from 6 overs) all of the criticism, blame and scrutiny will go on Kohli. Probably using his strike rate as their reasoning - but in reality it\u2019s an excuse. If RCB lose and you find yourself slandering Kohli, you don\u2019t understand cricket at all.",

His partner will focus on run a ball too.. \n\nVirat will never get out which means.. it will be too late for others.. and they will get out.\n\nYou need to have the guts to go all out in the beginning of the innings.. like Abhishek Sharma.. 37 in 12 balls. that is 10 times betters than 100 in 90 balls.",

The very first match of IPL Bazball had taken birth and later Yuvi, Gayle and Dhoni took their teams to such unconquerable peaks. Suddenly people had forgotten this and were shagging to dot balls and maidens. Glad that the original vision is back today.",

The problem is when you've achieved so much in your life by intensely giving a fuck every time you bat, it's very hard to stop giving a fuck. Rohit is still able to do this. Kohli and KL almost find it impossible. KL looks like he doesn't talk to anyone for an hour after getting out, and Kohli can't just be another guy who contributes, so we have this. They are not Manish Pandey or Rahane, the problem is mostly psychological. Gill will also have this problem in the future.",

Kohli\u2019s approach should be to hit and get going, not to protect the team from crashing. Rohit does that with MI - he goes if he can\u2019t score, thus giving the middle order time to get their confidence and back their skills.   \n\n\nTilak, SKY, Kishan, Hardik would\u2019ve floundered badly at RCB.",

That argument might be valid if Kohli got out after his fifty and entire team collapsed after that. But, that wasn't case tonight. He played 72 balls(including pp) which leaves rest of the team 48 balls and the fact that Green only got 6 deliveries while patidar and dk yet to bat shows how safe he was playing. Imagine every opener comes with a mindset that if he get outs team will collapse so he plays safe by scoring 100(70).\nI hate RCB, so im  happy to see them losing every match lol but i don't want the same thing to happen in WC",

One of us (Virat or Faf) had to bat till the end. I feel this total is effective on this pitch. I am not coming in with any premeditation. I knew I couldn't get over aggressive, just that I had to keep the bowlers guessing. It's just experience and maturity of playing the conditions. Even if there's dew, the surface is rough and dry, won't be easy for the batters. I couldn't get under the ball against Ashwin. Couldn't slog towards mid-wicket, so had to target straight down the ground.",
