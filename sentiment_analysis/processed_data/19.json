I also think that is precisely how a t20 opener should bat. 113* in 72 balls, just under 10 an over (9.4ish to be exact) against the best bowling unit in the league. He set a platform for others to get 30(10), 24(7), 12(4) etc - but no one did. \n\nAnyway, now I have finished dickriding, if RCB lose (as I write this now RR are 54-1 from 6 overs) all of the criticism, blame and scrutiny will go on Kohli. Probably using his strike rate as their reasoning - but in reality it\u2019s an excuse. If RCB lose and you find yourself slandering Kohli, you don\u2019t understand cricket at all.",
