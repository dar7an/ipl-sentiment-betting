Much easier to build variations when you already have the pace and bounce to make batters think twice.",

My actions were thoughtless and disrespectful, and I deeply regret the hurt and embarrassment it may have caused you.\n\nI want to acknowledge that you are an incredibly talented cricketer with immense potential. Your dedication, skill, and passion for the game are truly admirable. It was wrong of me to make fun of you, and I now realize the impact my words can have on someone's feelings.\n\nI understand how hurtful it can be to be on the receiving end of jokes and ridicule, especially in a public forum. I want to assure you that I have learned from this experience and will strive to be more mindful of my words and actions in the future.\n\nPlease accept my heartfelt apology for any pain I may have caused you. I genuinely admire your talent and wish you continued success in your cricketing journey. You deserve nothing but respect and support from fans like myself.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this letter. I hope that you can find it in your heart to forgive me for my thoughtless behavior.\n\nWith sincere apologies,\n\nr/cricket",

This is definitely not \"*a slap to his haters/doubters*\" because most of the time he was a filler in RR. But I for one am happy to see him playing mature cricket and enjoy himself out there. Good luck.",
