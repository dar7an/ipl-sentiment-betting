And his Domestic T20 strike rate is 14.8 ^(which is better than Mukesh Kumar, Arshdeep, Avesh, Harshal Patel, Chetan Sakariya, T Natarajan, Khaleel, N Saini, D Chahar, all whom have debuted for India)\n\nYes, his stats are on a small sample size, but ffs, they're completely fine, and _technically_ better than every fast bowler who's debuted for India in the last 5 years at least. I'm not saying he's at the level of Natarajan, Arshdeep or any of them.\n\nBut chill the fuck out with the nepotism claims. What you're saying is basically **\"He doesn't deserve to play because his father is a legend, unlike other player\".** And you guys wonder why a few players take mental health breaks.",

If you look at it like that, KL Rahul hasn\u2019t dipped in form but yet we hear everyone saying that. \n\nIs KL Rahul playing slow because his team has basically no batting except for Pooran, Stoinis and himself?

There's only a couple of bats on the team with the potential to go huge, and only 1 with any consistency. \n\nRahul doesn't attack the power play well, but he does milk the middle overs and rotate well, accelerating if he lasts long enough. Usually he plays a run a ball until 'fixing it' to a 130-150 later on, this would actually be okay if you've got a pooran at the other side all the time. If you were building a team and HAD to have Rahul, aggressive openers and Rahul coming in when there's a collapse or just outside the power play would probably be the best use of him.",

Stoinis has also been inconsistent but he's a matchwinner when he clicks. Even if KL isn't released, they need to build a better top order around KL and Stoinis. They'd likely want to push Badoni at 4 and back him there, which means Stoinis plays at 3. If KL is going to accumulate in the powerplay, they need someone that hits hard and from ball 1 to support him and not QdK with whatever he has been doing. Nicky P at 5 and Krunal at 7 are fine.",

The fact that he's arrogant enough that outside noise has genuinely never affected him, his non-fear of failure, is what makes him such an asset in crunch situations. With the fear of failure now making him overthink his game, he has lost his confidence in what he truly does well. \n\nSo many times he was trying that slower wide one with the ball, when it's a known fact that he's at his best when he's clicking 140 at length/back of length.\n\nWith the bat he's trying shots he doesn't really play too often with no zeal.",
