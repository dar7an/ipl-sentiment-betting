A contingent of these worshippers split recently and alleged Langer was inherently heretical, no mortal man had ever suffered like Jesus did until we saw his LinkedIn profile.\n\nThe truth is, Langer defies what the human mind is capable of interpreting.\n\nWe can only bask in his majesty.",

The once proud tradition of the batsman valuing his wicket above all else has been abandoned in the modern era of T20 cricket.\n\n\nGone are the days of digging in and fighting for every run, of respecting the bowler and the game. Now it's all about swing for the fences and hope for the best. Wickets are nothing more than disposable assets, traded away for a few quick runs and a fleeting moment of glory.\n\n\nAs an LSG fan and a general fan of batting, it breaks my heart to see the importance of my wicket diminish before my eyes. It used to be that a batsman's value was measured by his ability to stay at the crease, to weather the storm and lead his team to victory. But now, it seems that all anyone cares about is how many sixes you can hit in a row.\n\n\nWhere is the skill in that? Where is the artistry? I fear that in this new world of cricket as a LSG fan , the true value of the game has been lost. We must return to our roots, to the fundamental principles of cricket, if we are to preserve the sport we love. The wicket must once again be held sacred, a symbol of our dedication to the game and the team.\n\n\nUntil that day comes, I will continue to fight for every run, to protect my wicket at all costs. For I know that while the game may have changed, the true spirit of cricket will always remain.",
