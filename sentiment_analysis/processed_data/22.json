CSK, despite losing having 2 points less having played a game more are no doubt favorites at their home ground. Their loss to DC was bad but losing to a spirited SRH team can be excused. KKR mauled DC and beat RCB comprehensively but they're the two worst teams of this season. Their other win was against SRH and that was a good game overall which showed both side's strengths and weaknesses. Only if they win today should KKR be considered as one of the top dogs for the play-offs, and only then should CSK fans think their team is in trouble. If not, then CSK will continue on to be favorites for the play-offs as always and KKR will try to prevent a slide that haunts them at the middle of every season.",

All boundaries in an over was such a precious thing back in the day, now they are doing it like a joke. Doesn\u2019t feel like cricket anymore.\n\nWe are getting some glimpses of beautiful bowling here and there but most overs there are so many wides and no balls it\u2019s annoying! \n\nRemember how strong our bowling unit was in wc? Bumrah shami siraj\u2026batsmen literally peed in their pants to face them. Hopefully someday we will get a proper face off. Everyone loves watching sixes and stats so ipl has become way too much batting friendly.",
