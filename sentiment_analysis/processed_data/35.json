It may or may not work, but they are going at everything, and having faith on the team. Add to that when they're in such a form feeding someone like lalit who then bowled like shit, that too in a powerplay lol.\n\nAppreciate the batting prowess of such talented players. Yea there are mostly flat pitches these days but this is just a team who's executing their plans very well.",

                "comment": "You know what, the vibe around this current SRH is naturally developed. It's not like they would've planned for this aggressive mindset. But they've seen it work multiple times and now it's the default mindset. What it does is that other teams who are not doing it every match have to adapt suddenly and play like it (like what RCB did). This might just change the entire T20 scenario.",

A batsman batting in Chennai and Lucknow's stats will never compete with guys batting in Wankhede and Chinnaswamy, there's just too much of a difference. You have to look at more nuanced stats which compare impact, otherwise forget about it, pure SR and avgs mean absolutely nothing now.",

Nortje\n\n10. Ishant\n\n11. Khaleel\n\nIP: Mukesh or Lalit Yadav (if spinning track)\n\nthey can move around the batting order based on the situation. but I think Warner should sit out. he's looked out of form this season. And Shaw and JFM can maximize the powerplay better",
