When you recover your hair, you will lose all your skills in something else. And I have no idea what it will be.\"\n\nDesperate to have his hair back and feeling he had nothing to lose, Harshal agreed to take the risk. Unfortunately for him, the area in which he lost his skills was nothing other than bowling, the way he has earned his livelihood for many years.\n\nToday, many of those no longer blessed with luscious locks speak in hushed tones of their awe for the newly hirsute Hairshal Patel. He may have lost his magical powers with the ball in hand, but he has gained not only his hair but also the respect of many bald frauds around the globe, something which is far more valuable to him.",
