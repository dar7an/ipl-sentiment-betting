I'm meeting a girl (a real one) in half an hour (wouldn't expect a lot of you to understand anyway) so please don't DM me asking me where I am (im with the girl, ok) you'll most likely get aired because ill be with the girl (again I don't expect you to understand) shes actually really interested in me and its not a situation i can pass up for some meaningless cricket degenerates (because ill be meeting a girl, not that you really are going to understand) this is my life now. Meeting women and not wasting my precious time watch cricket, I have to move on from such simple things and branch out (you wouldnt understand)",

Can hardly remember a handful of good innings throughout his time at Pbks and certainly not lived up to potential to say the least.",

Let's face it, folks. Whether PBKS or GT emerges victorious, it's all just a blip in the cosmic timeline. One day, the sun will swallow us whole, rendering our wins and losses as inconsequential as yesterday's gossip. So, by all means, cheer for your team, revel in the drama, but let's not pretend it's anything more than a distraction from the impending heat death of the universe.

Some player is trying to build up his innings or have played 2-3 dots and the people here go bonkers. Yesterday it was Virat Kohli who was being called a \"liability\" and today it's Kane  \"breaking momentum eating balls\". So many reactionary comments makes me wonder if some people here all are watching cricket for the first time and expects every ball to go for a boundary. It's not about a particular player it's just annoying to watch some people shitting on players for fun. (I expected reddit audience to be more sophisticated than Average 35yo Indian uncle abusing a player cause he played two dot balls)",

They had Nalkande in the team and didn't give him a single over. If you're not gonna bowl a bowler then might have played another batter and go hard in the middle overs. And don't get me started on the fielding. Nehra ji has made blunders this game, some grave mistakes that too which could cost them this match. This match should have been a free win, because you're playing PBKS at your home ffs.",
