When the judge then suggested that he live with his grandparents, the boy cried out that they also beat him.\n\nAfter considering the remainder of the immediate family and learning that domestic violence was apparently a way of life among them, the judge took the unprecedented step of allowing the boy to propose who should have custody of him. \n\nAfter two recesses to check legal references and confer with child welfare officials, the judge granted temporary custody to the Royal Challenger Bengaluru, whom the boy firmly believes are not capable of beating anyone!",
