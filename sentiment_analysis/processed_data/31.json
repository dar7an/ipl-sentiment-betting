The game will get tilted towards raw power and those who can wield it (wi, aus, sa ) and skill and wrist work etc (subcontinent) will fall behind in the race",

He was denied any deliveries on the leg side to free his arms. Ashwin and Chahal regularly bowled really wide to him on the off. Boult with his slower bouncers. \n\nHe negated them all by playing straight. And playing brilliantly.\n\nAmong the tons so far, this is among the very best.

The boy has a history of being beaten by his parents and the judge initially awarded custody to his aunt, in keeping with child custody law and regulations requiring that family unity be maintained to the degree possible.\n\nThe boy surprised the court when he proclaimed that his aunt beat him more than his parents and he adamantly refused to live with her. When the judge then suggested that he live with his grandparents, the boy cried out that they also beat him.\n\nAfter considering the remainder of the immediate family and learning that domestic violence was apparently a way of life among them, the judge took the unprecedented step of allowing the boy to propose who should have custody of him. \n\nAfter two recesses to check legal references and confer with child welfare officials, the judge granted temporary custody to the Royal Challenger Bengaluru, whom the boy firmly believes are not capable of beating anyone!",

I'm not saying we should have slow pitches everywhere, but now every game has become a bat fest with everyone coming in and slogging around. I don't find this exciting at all. Hope things get better by the second half of the tournament. Until then, I'll just watch the odd few overs here and there.",

                "comment": "Why do the purists on this sub hate  watch T20 leagues when T20 Internationals are way different from T20 leagues and get upset when 200+ runs are scored frequently \n\nWhy hate watch something that you don't like you aren't even the target audience of this league?\n\nJust turn off the TV when you feel if the game isn't for you \n\nOr do most people here don't actually watch the games and just make their opinions on the basis of scorecards \n\nSalt and Russell two intent merchants made 23 off 23 Iyer made 11 off 7 so they all made 34 off 30 \n\nSo the whole why not use a bowling machine arguments are stupid\n\nRinku also didn't look in full flow today and Narine slowed after his 100 he made 9 off his next 7 balls\nSo that's 41 off 37, Venky made 8 off 6 and Ramandeep scored a single in his only delivery so that's\nSo that's 50 off 43 which is basically an anchor innings \n\nRR also gave 21 Extras in this innings \n\nThat's 50 off 43 (71 off 43)\n\nSo they basically made 152 off 77 \n\nAnd it took One of their most in-form batters to bash the two best spinners in the opposition team \n\nThe likelihood of Ashwin and Chahal conceding so many is very rare\n\nSo it wasn't as flat as you believe \n\nBoult also went for 31 in his 4 on this wicket on every flat pitch qualify bowlers like Bumrah, Cummins, Boult, Vaibhav Arora also went for 3-27 in his 4 against DC in Vizag so the whole argument that Not everyone can be Bumrah bro doesn't hold true\n\nReal fact is there isn't enough fast bowling talent in India to cover up 10 teams and the Impact player rule does make a difference but the first point is one of the bigger reasons as to why so many games are low scoring.\n\nAlso the lack of Saturday Double Headers also is partially responsible for it\n\nOnce all pitches reach 4 to 5 games each they will began to slow down\n\nTldr: The pitch is flat but isn't a pitch where bowlers have nothing and you can blindly slog and strike at 200+",

This is the brand of cricket the founders had in mind when they conceived the format, 450 odd runs being scored in 40 overs, wickets are simply a byproduct when you're operating at that strike-rate. Exciting, racy cricket to watch, coupled with your favorite Bollywood tunes to dance to. 30 seconds of fame for all, to see themselves on the big screen and be seen by millions from around the world.",

But what we're seeing is absolute opposite.\n\nIndia team will reach USA half tired after 2 months of this clown fuckery.
