Some aberations here, traditionally teams that have batted first have succeeded but not this season. Spinners haven't had a significant part in this season either as has been the case previously. It looks very dry, there's a mosaic underlay and there isn't really a sheen that you have come to expect in this year's IPL. Same surface that was used in that game against GT where CSK scored over 200 runs. This pitch produces the greatest degree of turn, 2.4 degrees as compared 1,8 degrees compared to the other pitches. Still think there will be some assistance for the spinners and for those who can bowl slower delivers but there's still runs on the board. Might just want to have couple of extra overs of spin up your sleeve. There might be significant dew later in the evening\" say Anjum Chopra and Samuel Badree",

Can't expect him to hit every game , wont be surprised if he goes off early today , Gaikwad and Rahane need to step up their game , especially Rahane , he has to go crazy in that first 6 overs and don't care about his wicket - If Moeen Ali is playing , he can also play a quickfire innings. Don't see CSK winning (if they bat first) AND if they don't follow a certain plan to attack\n\nIf CSK bat second , none of these will matter as I think (controversial opinion) that CSK bowlers will get quick wickets and get them to a below 180-190 score , but still CSK may take it a little deeper than required.",
