All because he's given the role that suits him best. \nA bunch of top names that don't complement each other is still a shit team.",

They still give legendary performances when they aren't in their prime anymore but that assurance fades away. I believe we are witnessing Bumrah in his prime rn, and its absolutely glorious.",

It's when others contributed, that RCB scored the additional 15 runs. All these comments just proves that you don't actually care about the score. You just here to mindlessly hate on Kohli no matter what",

And it went down exactly as we hoped. Don't get me wrong, for me kohli is the biggest match winner for india, but while batting first in t20s , he is indeed a liability for the team. He does eat up too many balls and not let other batsmen play enough balls.",

Kohli was out early today, so Faf held anchor till the 16th over. Plus, Kohli did it at a higher SR on a bigger ground, on a tougher pitch, and better bowlers (with the exception of Bumrah of course). Also, without using up an impact player.\u00a0\n\n\nThe difference between last match and today was that DK went berserk at the end today whereas Green couldn't do the same in the last match.\u00a0",

I didn't even liked cricket but my heart was pounding after witnessing this shot. Felt something poking down when I checked it was a huge fckin b0ner, ashamed I looked around when I saw this girl, she had the same horny expression, our eyes met and it took us hardly any long before we were making out in the back of my car, we drove home ,she pulled me towards the kitchen while the TV was running in the bg, with every shot we became more and more intimate and climaxed when Kishan hit a helicopter shot out of the boundary. After experimenting some more we found that pre-recorded innings didn't work 'that' well,We are most intimate when Kishan is playing live and God knows what will happen if he bats for the whole inning.",
