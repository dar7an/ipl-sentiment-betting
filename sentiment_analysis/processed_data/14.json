Hardik responded with a thumbs up as there were surpirisingly a few cheers too\n\nHowever, at 6:55, it got clear that people were saving their boos for the toss. Rohit Rohit chants started, that's how people got to know Pandya has entered the field. Boos started 10 secs before Manjarekar started speaking. That's also why he said \"behave\" when he took Hardik's name. Boos got extra loud after his name was announced \n\nSamson was cheered by MI fans for winning the toss. No boos when Samson spoke. Boos resumed when Hardik started speaking\n\nMumbai Cha Raja Rohit Sharma was chanted just twice. It was mainly Rohit Rohit and Boooo\n\n7:35 PM - Crowd is shell shocked and absolute silence here as Rohit gets a golden duck. Next update might be on Hardik entry now\n\n7:53 PM - Hardik entered the ground, people booed for like 3 secs, and DJ started playing \"Ghalin Lotangan\". It's a devotional song, so people didn't boo as respect. The song ended with a Ganpati Bappa Morya chant. People finally booed again when the DJ announced \"next Batsman, Hardik Pandya!\" Good trick by DJ\n\n8:02 PM - Hardik hit two fours. People cheering now, but Trumpet guy trolling by playing the song \"Kauwa moti khayega\" (Kauwa is generally used to refer Hardik on the internet, and the song means that even the bad guy's day will eventually come)\n\n8:20 PM - Stadium is rejoicing Hardik's performance. Some MI fans are cheering for RR's good moments, but apart from that everyone is putting team above hatred. Very few boos now, cheers clearly outnumbering\n\n8:22 PM - Hardik is gone. No boos apart from certain people who are here just for it. Crowd is silent in general, they realise the position MI is in, if Chawla is coming in over no.10\n\n9:18 PM - 19.4 overs down, Hardik shown on the screen and people booed, coz he was smiling in the dressing room\n\n9:52 PM - Hardik dropped Buttler, people \"ooooohhh\"ed first, and then booed him after he overreacted\n\n10:07 PM - Hardik cheered for stopping a four, for like 5 secs, and then people realised he is Hardik, so started booing\n\n10:09 PM - Minor Nita Ambani boo, when showed on big screen\n\n10:26 PM - Huge cheer for Rohit as he comes to field on boundary\n\n10:28 PM - Hardik fields well and still gets a boo. This was purely momentum driven, as last ball was just fielder by Rohit, so they were vocal anyway. The boos were followed immediately by \"Humara captain kaisa ho, Rohit Sharma jaisa ho\". This chant continued for the next 10 mins, with a 1-2 ball gap every time\n\n10:56 - Final boos, very light, as most people have already left the stand\n\nSpecial updates - as said earlier, this was tightest security at entry that I experienced at Wankhede. Moreover, while returning, street from where the team bus exits was blocked. Generally, that's the road which people use to get back to the railway station",

He has never been a great, let alone good ipl batter. His ipl stats are terrible. With his age, his time was coming, this is just a proactive move by MI so Rohit could be around and mentor Hardik. Too bad media and paid PRs and the star status of everyone involved screwed everything up.",

Even if you assume that he just has shit luck, then his arrogance is also not great for dressing room environment. He likes when spotlight is on him, and that might help him perform better but that doesn't mean it's certainly the best thing for the team to win them that game. And he's definitely not captain material. He needs a Rohit, Dhoni or Kohli in the team to keep his motormouth in check. Basically someone clear and more senior than him.",

So, it did affect him - but he had a strategy to deal with it.\n\n\nI would also argue that Hardik is as badly placed to face this vitriol as Smith was suited. I am not saying that Smith is a sociopath but he really cares about very little other than batting.\u00a0\n\n\nHardik, on the other hand, seems to care very much about his image. Ha has always expended a lot of energy trying to 'look cool', whether it is in his appearance or in his posed celebrations after taking a wicket or catch.\n\n\nSo, maybe Hardik would have been more likely to take that difficult catch if the Mumbai fans had not been booing him.",

Considering whatever Hardik Pandya is going through let me post it again.\n\nInstead of awkwardly smiling and glancing around during that press conference(a question was asked specifically about Rohit Sharma), Hardik Pandya should have responded like this: \"Rohit bhai has always been and will always be my captain. I've always aspired to be a leader like him. I'm confident that Rohit bhai will continue to guide and support me, and it's important for me to seek advice from someone as experienced as him. I'm optimistic about our collective efforts to secure our 6th IPL title.\"\n\nInstead his silence only fueled speculation, whereas a statement like above could have eased tensions. It appears that Hardik might have let his ego get the better of him, thinking he's better to Rohit in this role and not needing to express such sentiments.",

                "comment": "We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.\n\nPeople on this subreddit hate Riyan Parag.\n\nThe first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: y'all are jealous of him.\n\nLikely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into cricket in the last couple years. So you don't know how this sport works.\n\nAnd because you didn't know that, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: Cricket isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up \"Strike rate \" or \"average \" I know they know nothing about cricket.\n\nParag's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest dancer ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.\n\nSo when I hear somebody say that AB Devillers is better than Riyan Parag, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Parag play wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched cricket for a significant amount of time, so I know that Parag is better.\n\nYou might be jealous of Parag's six packs, or jealous of his status as the greatest finisher in RR history, or whatever. Unless you're a cricket fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or an RR fan who watched IPL since 2008, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win cricket looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.\n\nThis sub would make you think that Parag isn't even a top 100 player ever.\n\nSo don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your \"greats\" like ~~Virat Kohli~~ The Best Player in the World\u2122, but leave the Riyan Parag talk to the adults. Fair?",
