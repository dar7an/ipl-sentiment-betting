Varun stares into the souls of the audience. A wild Narine says, \u201cI chuck, I chuck,\u201d loudly. But wait, there\u2019s more. A wild Neeraj Chopra approaches, removes his wig, and guess what, it\u2019s Suyyash Sharma. Kingku goes on his knees and proposes to Suhana. The ground goes silent. A sad, tensed-up Kavya runs to the ground, stops the proposal, and is on her knees to propose to Kingku. SRK begs Kingku to reject her. Kavya says, \u201cIf Kingku says yes, you can have the IPL trophy.\u201d SRK rejects the offer, saying, \u201cI only want Kingku.\u201d GG says, \u201cEk rejection ne aapko IPL trophy nhi dilayi hai.\u201d Kingku says, \u201cI want you, Shah Rukh. I thought Suhana was you in a wig.\u201d But wait, Chandu cuts the sleeves of Kingku, revealing a new tattoo with the golden prophecy written on it: \u201cTHALA FOR A REASON.\u201d The whole ground starts chanting, \u201cCSK! CSK!\u201d Whistles echo. SRH and KKR teammates start having an orgy while Thala comes and takes away the trophy, saying, \u201cThala for a reason and Thala for another season.\u201d In the end, Harshit Rana gets a ban for 7 seasons.",

The only thing worse than the club itself are the players, mistri spinning, sex appeal having chucking players. What I really want for Christmas is for KKR to stay 9th every year. I don't want them bottom of the table. No, I just want them to start well every season and have hope and then slowly spiral into the inevitable 9th place with exactly 6 points. Every year, season after season until everyone just collectively decides that the franchise gets dissolved.\n\nSuck my dick KKR, every day you exist makes my life miserable.",

I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Starc. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love.",

Amidst deafening roars from the packed stands, the Shah Rukh Khan-owned franchise etched\u00a0their\u00a0name in IPL folklore once again, adding another glorious chapter to\u00a0their\u00a0storied legacy.\n\nWhile star performers like Venkatesh Iyer and Nitish Rana played their part, it was the unheralded Rinku Singh who truly stole the show. With KKR teetering at 89/5 in their pursuit of 174, the left-hander displayed nerves of steel, smashing an unbeaten 42 off just 28 deliveries to guide his team home.\n\nFor SRH, Pat Cummins led from the front, both with the ball and the bat. The Australian spearhead claimed three crucial wickets before contributing a blistering 33 off just 18 balls. However, his efforts ultimately fell short as KKR held their nerve in the closing stages.",

We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him tighten his ass as he chops wood, shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Pat. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love.",

I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to bhuvi. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love.",
