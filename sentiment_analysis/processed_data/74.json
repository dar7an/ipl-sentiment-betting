I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Starc. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love.",

With KKR teetering at 89/5 in their pursuit of 174, the left-hander displayed nerves of steel, smashing an unbeaten 42 off just 28 deliveries to guide his team home.\n\nFor SRH, Pat Cummins led from the front, both with the ball and the bat. The Australian spearhead claimed three crucial wickets before contributing a blistering 33 off just 18 balls.

I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Pat. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin.

We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him tighten his ass as he chops wood, shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to bhuvi. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love.",
