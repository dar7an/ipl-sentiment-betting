But don't take the responsibiltiy of RCB on your shoulders. Because if you do, it just doesn't work. Especially in T20s, one guy can't win you games. You need to trust that the middle and lower order will do well. 3 quick fire 30s > 1 medium paced 100.\n\nI don't think RCB will start winning games, if you take more risk and potentially get out.

Accelerate, if you have wickets in hand.\n\nDont play for your 100. You clearly always do, and it costs the team.\n\nIt's not all your fault, you have been the best player for SRH this season. But don't take the responsibiltiy of SRH on your shoulders. Because if you do, it just doesn't work. Especially in T20s, one guy can't win you games. You need to trust that the middle and lower order will do well. 3 quick fire 30s > 1 medium paced 100.\n\nI don't think SRH will start winning games, if you take more risk and potentially get out. There are other big issues with the team and management. But atleast people will stop blaming you. Let the rest of the batters get a chance to do their job, if they fail, it's on them.\n\n/s",

But don't take the responsibiltiy of SRH on your shoulders. Because if you do, it just doesn't work. Especially in T20s, one guy can't win you games. You need to trust that the middle and lower order will do well. 3 quick fire 30s > 1 medium paced 100.\n\nI don't think SRH will start winning games, if you take more risk and potentially get out. There are other big issues with the team and management. But atleast people will stop blaming you. Let the rest of the batters get a chance to do their job, if they fail, it's on them.\n\n/s",

Accelerate, if you have wickets in hand.\n\nDont play for your 100. You clearly always do, and it costs the team.\n\nIt's not all your fault, you have been the best player for SRH this season. But don't take the responsibiltiy of SRH on your shoulders. Because if you do, it just doesn't work. Especially in T20s, one guy can't win you games. You need to trust that the middle and lower order will do well. 3 quick fire 30s > 1 medium paced 100.\n\nI don't think SRH will start winning games, if you take more risk and potentially get out. There are other big issues with the team and management. But atleast people will stop blaming you. Let the rest of the batters get a chance to do their job, if they fail, it's on them.\n\n/s",

Accelerate, if you have wickets in hand.\n\nDont play for your 100. You clearly always do, and it costs the team.\n\nIt's not all your fault, you have been the best player for SRH this season. But don't take the responsibiltiy of SRH on your shoulders. Because if you do, it just doesn't work. Especially in T20s, one guy can't win you games. You need to trust that the middle and lower order will do well. 3 quick fire 30s > 1 medium paced 100.\n\nI don't think SRH will start winning games, if you take more risk and potentially get out. There are other big issues with the team and management. But atleast people will stop blaming you. Let the rest of the batters get a chance to do their job, if they fail, it's on them.\n\n/s",
