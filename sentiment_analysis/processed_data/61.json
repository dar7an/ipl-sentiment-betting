Fully expect CSK to take a chunk out of this chase up front if Ravindra can connect with the ball. \n\nHate to overhype the kid when it's not a DC game, but if Mcgurk was playing here and had a decent game, he might make you 40 from 20 on a slow wicket anyway, and let everyone else pace their innings outside of the power play. \n\nI also hate to jump the gun, but without some second half magic or bowling magic, it feels over already.",
