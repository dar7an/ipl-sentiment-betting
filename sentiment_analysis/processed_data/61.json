Losing power play wickets is mattering less and less if they've attacked up front. Fully expect CSK to take a chunk out of this chase up front if Ravindra can connect with the ball. \n\nHate to overhype the kid when it's not a DC game, but if Mcgurk was playing here and had a decent game, he might make you 40 from 20 on a slow wicket anyway, and let everyone else pace their innings outside of the power play. \n\nI also hate to jump the gun, but without some second half magic or bowling magic, it feels over already.",

It was just a good watch with all the highs and lows and each stadium bringing in something. Fast forward to today the fans mind have gone so corrupt that they would want nothing less than Hyderabad/Mumbai like pitch. Which is also biased towards batsmen btw.",

You think PBKS dropping so many catches vs RCB was just poor fielding? You think RR doing tuk tuk in first innings today was just poor batting? When GL and RPS were introduced for 2 years one made it to playoffs in first year while other shat bed and next year the other made it to playoffs and the first shat the bed. You think it was coincidence? You think GT and LSG the new teams (which are looking to increase their popularity) making continuous playoffs in their initial years is just a coincidence? You think MI - Women and RCB - Women (the two teams with highest popularity) winning first 2 years of WPL was just a coincidence?",

Playing with a 1 batter less while batting first, causes everyone to bat too conservatively \n\n4. Playing Nandre Burger instead of Keshav Maharaj as the impact sub on this pitch\n\nAshwin + Chahal + Maharaj would have been great for middle overs spin choke and wickets. Boult, Sandeep, and Avesh would have been enough for the initial powerplay and death\n\nRR is known to taper off in the second half, and I think that's happening again. The good part for them is that they already have 16 points so they'll probably still qualify but they may or may not finish in top 2",

Yesterday it was Virat Kohli who was being called a \"liability\" and today it's Ruturaj  \"breaking momentum eating balls\" Gaikwad. So many reactionary comments makes me wonder if some people here all are watching cricket for the first time and expects every ball to go for a boundary. It's not about a particular player it's just annoying to watch some people shitting on players for fun.
