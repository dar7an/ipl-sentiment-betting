Bottom of the table just a few matches ago\n\n4.  Panty coming back from that crash\n\n5. Panty's captaincy\n\nAnd now playing back to back matches with just 1 day rest and travelling over 2k km in between .... we are still alive in the tournament. In fact, we can do the funniest thing if we win tonight...we will be 2nd on the table. Lezooooooooooo",

His accident, while terrible and I wish him the best, he was stupid and acting recklessly. Would BCCI invest in any other player as much as this? And how he gets to waltz back into the team?\n\nSo other players need to prove in international level, but Pant can come back after IPL stint?\n\nWhat more does Samson need to do honestly?

The only problem is that there are no full deliveries in baseball, and you line up your strokes in the horizontal plane. In cricket however, having a high backlift leaves you exposed to the full ball and compromises your strokes in the vertical plane.",

Let's see if DC can turn it around in these last 4 and get to a modest 170 ish.\u00a0",

Sanju may not have shown us great results in T20Is so far but he sure has shown enough potential - he can bat sensibly when things are tricky and very well knows how to change gears. Pant, on the other hand gets exposed against good bowling (game against SRH) or tricky tracks.",
