Those first few powerplay overs are so often underutilised in my opinion. 2 out, hard ball and almost exclusively quick bowlers, there's a massive opportunity to really score a lot and it's worth burning a wicket taking that on. Travis Head isn't going to come off all the time, but he's smart enough to take on the areas where there are no deep fielders and has the skill to carry the plan out. I think more teams should explore this option of at least one batter being hyper aggressive early. They do it late when the field is back and the ball is soft, why not take the risk earlier too?",

Like even Jinks can justify his position and thrive in CSK, certainly someone with quality of Kohli can be used to win matches. But not with RCB tho, RCB have no philosophy neither any strategy or plan. They are all headless chickens relying on individual flashes of brilliance.
