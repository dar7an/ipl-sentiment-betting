Not using your best bowler at the beginning of the innings.\n\n\n3. Pandya's terrible line and length in the final over esp to Dhoni. Some of those balls that he launched into the orbit were gifts.\n\n\n4. Overall being very rigid and not flexible enough to change plans according to the situation of the game.",

I didn't even liked cricket but my heart was pounding after witnessing this shot. Felt something poking down when I checked it was a huge fckin boner, ashamed I looked around when I saw this girl, she had the same horny expression, our eyes met and it took us hardly any long before we were making out in the back of my car, we drove home ,she pulled me towards the kitchen while the TV was running in the bg, with every shot we became more and more intimate and climaxed when Kishan hit a helicopter shot out of the boundary. After experimenting some more we found that pre-recorded innings didn't work 'that' well,We are most intimate when Kishan is playing live and God knows what will happen if he bats for the whole inning.",

I didn't even liked cricket but my heart was pounding after witnessing this shot. Felt something poking down when I checked it was a huge fckin boner, ashamed I looked around when I saw this girl, she had the same horny expression, our eyes met and it took us hardly any long before we were making out in the back of my car, we drove home ,she pulled me towards the kitchen while the TV was running in the bg, with every shot we became more and more intimate and climaxed when Kishan hit a helicopter shot out of the boundary. After experimenting some more we found that pre-recorded innings didn't work 'that' well,We are most intimate when Kishan is playing live and God knows what will happen if he bats for the whole inning.",
