This new stadium is built by the camp that is opposed to PCA (Punjab Cricket Association), built with about 10k incremental seating capacity to the existing PCA stadium in Mohali, just a few kilometers away from each other, about an hour's drive from the team Hotel (which just kills momentum and energy for the home team) and quite away from the populated areas of Chandigarh, making it less accessible for the common man to watch and support PK team. \nA new stadium is definitely warranted in the state of Punjab, however I cannot understand why Amritsar city was not considered -  Decent population, more 'massy' population (Chandigarh is a city of elites - judges, lawyers, adminsitrators and hence the residents are less likely to go to stadiums), good flight connections domestically and internationally.",

You play 14 high intensity games in the space of 1.5 months against the best players in the world. And Chahal has done that every year and come out on top. I just can't understand how you can overlook this and look at meaningless bilaterals where players don't even give their 100%.",

I guess that's how it is supposed to be..\nBut I'm curious to know how decisions are made especially related to bowling changes and field changes (to what extent is it driven by Sanju the captain vs Sanga the coach). Apart from Boult opening with 2 or 3 overs in the PP, and using Avesh in the 20th, RR's strategy differs starkly across every game",

It's not about massive sixes, uprooted stumps, and mammoth totals, it's about the funniest possible thing happening at any given moment:\n\n\nPBKS losing their captain and RR losing half their team before the toss? Good start.\n\n\nPlayers climbing over each other to take catches? Even better.\u00a0\n\n\nMatch thread clutching pearls over a routine celebration? Hilarious.\n\n\nPunjab shithousing a decent total after being forced to use their impact sub in the first innings? Hysterical!\n\n\nThe specialist bowler that RR brought in not bowling a single over and then being sent to open and whacking Rabada for 4? Absolutely fucking comical.",

Rabada settles under it and snares the chance!\n\nRiyan Parag c Rabada b Arshdeep Singh 23 (18b 1x4 1x6) SR: 127.77",

Does not middle it at all and he cloths it towards deep mid wicket. Shashank tears in from the fence, slides forward and gobbles up the chance! RR's chase is flagging!\n\nDhruv Jurel c Shashank Singh b Patel 6 (11b 0x4 0x6) SR: 54.54",
