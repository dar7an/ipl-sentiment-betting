Dhoni walks into the ground, just like it's 2019! He is having a heated argument with the match referee Virat Kohli. Reports say that Anushka Sharma is live streaming the incident on her Instagram, victimising Virat Kohli. Virat doesn't allow a re-toss! The eternal commentator Sunny G and 97 man Gautam Gambhir have walked to oppose Kohli. They seem to not care about CSK. Just here to bash Kohli. Ashutosh is declared the toss winner. But there's a twist! Thala denies a choice to Ashutosh Sharma! Just like he used to deny singles to his team mates! And Thala chooses Punjab will have a bowl! Everybody is worshipping thala for his masterstroke.\"",

However, it\u2019s hard to understand how someone like Thakur can concentrate freely on their batting and the ball that\u2019s coming, when all that can be heard so loudly are chants of \u201cDHONI, DHONI!\u201d and \u201cWE WANT DHONI!\u201d. Surely that does anything but help the batter on strike, and is actually quite a negative distraction. The failure to support the batter on strike, and recognise the issue, speaks to the toxicity of CSK\u2019s fanbase, which of course was there in large numbers during the innings today. I used to love CSK, especially due to Indian legends like Dhoni and Jadeja, who have won so many games for them. But now having seen the problems with so many of their fans, I am less inclined to do so in the future. This likely won\u2019t be popular or necessary to say, but just the perspective of an unbiased Indian fan",
