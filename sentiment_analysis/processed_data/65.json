It\u2019s almost as if they want someone who can perfectly pace the innings, and always score big. Like Kohli has done consistently in the recent past (and before as well). But then, they also complain about Kohli. Not sure why they feel like there are a lot of hidden gems somewhere in India who can all play this perfect game every single time but somehow are not given deserving chances.",

Then you have spinners like Piyush and Varun C. We see guys like Shashank, Jitesh who are 30+. Even Sanju is becoming much more consistent at 30, and Rohit found a spot in Tests only at 32. KL had a resurgence in Tests at 30. Zaheer was a better bowler after 30.   \n\nSome GUN players are good even when young and that\u2019s what sets them apart from the others - these are the Sachins, jaiswals, gills, Rohits, Kohlis, Pants, Yuvraj, Rainas etc.",

You create a system where you reward only aggregate over SR that's what happens.\n\nKohli and Patel have improved tremendously in the 2nd half but they haven't been better than Head oe Bumrah.\n\nI much prefer we abolish those outdated cap system or use some advanced model like Cricinfo and Cricviz which take SR and pitch into account.

The onus is on Samson and parag each and every game to pull the game back and on hettie and Powell to finish. Jurel my guy has forgotten who he is \ud83d\ude2d. Our batting lineup consists if just 2 people really. Samson and jurel. The rest randomly show up here and there.\nEsit: Samson and PARAG not jurel mb",
