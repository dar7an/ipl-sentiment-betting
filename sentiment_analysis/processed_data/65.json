You create a system where you reward only aggregate over SR that's what happens.\n\nKohli and Patel have improved tremendously in the 2nd half but they haven't been better than Head oe Bumrah.\n\nI much prefer we abolish those outdated cap system or use some advanced model like Cricinfo and Cricviz which take SR and pitch into account.
