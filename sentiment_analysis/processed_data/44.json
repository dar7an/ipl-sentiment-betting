Sanju clearly doesn't trust Kotian with the ball given the PBKS game and unless we drop Powell (bad idea) we can't get Maharaj in. So if we drop him for, say, Sen, we either have to roll one spinner or give Parag genuine bowling responsibilities.\u00a0",

They have like 25k to 50k people at any given venue. They want them to be there longer, so they can get them to spend more at the venue(s). Low-scoring games that end early, with boring defensive cricket on display, where bowlers come out of top doesn't help sales and commerce.  This is like a big party for the audience, they want to dance every over, celebrate every boundary/six.\n\nIt's commercial entertainment. they want to pack more action in 40 over bandwidth they're working with. More runs per game was a no-brainer, to get more leverage out of the audience.\n\nIPL is a good example of how economics can influence the evolution of a given sport.\n\nSorry for the rant, folks. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sweat)",

If I had to pick something out, we could have taken a couple of more chances in the middle overs. The left-handers could have probably gone after Axar a little bit, it\u2019s something we missed out in terms of game awareness. It was quite amazing the way he (Fraser-McGurk) batted, he took calculated risks, he played the field really well. It shows the fearlessness of youth.
