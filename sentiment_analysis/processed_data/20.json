It\u2019s true that Nehra/Gill played a big role there, but still. Now in 2024, MI is looking to transition from Rohit because of age. Their options are: SKY, Bumrah, Kishan. None of them have a captaincy record. Or they can approach Hardik, a proven IPL captain, ex-MI player, and the likely future ICT t20 captain. Remember, Hardik also isn\u2019t an outsider to MI. He grew up here, helped us win 4 trophies. He has pedigree with MI. As much a claim to captaincy as Boom/SKY. The only party to blame in the whole fiasco is our management.

Develop a stadium culture in the city \n2. More sales for the vendors inside the stadium \n3. Real fans can attend the stadium at a minimum cost\n\n(This is not an alien concept.

They used the off-pace balls well and pulled things back in the middle over. From over number 7 to 15, only 63 runs were scored as MI's middle order seem to loose their way with 4 wickets going down. Axar Patel was the pivot for DC in this phase. \n\nHowever, then we entered the final lap and MI hit turbo mode. Last 5 overs saw 96 runs being scored. David and Shepherd demolishes the DC quicks who were all over the place. Too many wides as well as yorkers going wrong and being converted to full tosses and sixes, eventually. \n\nThis is going to be a tall order for DC batters.
