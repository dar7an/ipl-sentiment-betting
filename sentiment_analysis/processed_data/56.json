Even within ODI, going from 60 overs to 50 overs, then the first 15 over fielding restrictions, Jaysurya making great use of that, etc etc.\n\nWhile test cricket is a beautiful thing, ODI democratized cricket more and T20 more so. More smaller countries are slowly becoming prominent. I know, painfully slowly, perhaps, but still better than nothing.\n\nThe good balls of yester-years may not always be good balls today, based on the pitch.
