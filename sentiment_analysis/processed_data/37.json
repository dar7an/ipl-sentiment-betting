One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin.

Fuck Nadal's defense, Djokovic's backhand, Federer volleys etc. We only want to see aces bro. T20 batting is only testing one facet of batting. Hitting. Fuck defensive technique, strike rotation, game management, risk assessment, running between the wickets etc. A guy like Kohli is just an ordinary IPL player now because he's only being tested in one facet of the game: hitting. He's trained all his life to be a top all round player, as do most guys like Gill, Rahul etc, players who people call anchors. Soon they won't be able to compete with guys like Fraser McGurk who have optimised their technique for only one thing all their lives. That's why pitches like these are refreshing.",
