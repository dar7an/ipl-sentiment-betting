If they had been playing like the MI of old, this would have been a one sided affair, instead of looking a 50-50 match. In fact, I'll give DC slight edge, because they're batting first, It's DC 55, MI 45.",

Impact rule\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou won't see these 3 things together in international t20s. For example, SCG has flat track but they have longer boundaries to back that. Eden park in NZ has small boundaries and flat pitch but you won't see impact rule there.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nSo yeah IPL \u2260 T20i . Below 200 is still the norm in international t20s. People watch porn and think that this is what real sex looks like. Similarly BCCI is serving batting porn for entertainment purpose. Watch and enjoy.

From your sexy hair to that killer batting stance, you've got me swooning every time you're on the field.\n\nSeriously, those shots you play? They're like poetry in motion. And let's not even get started on your fitness \u2013 I mean, have you looked in the mirror lately? *Sigh*.\n\nBut it's not just about the cricket, you know? There's something about your confidence and charisma that drives me wild. You've got that irresistible charm that makes me want to watch every match, just hoping to catch a glimpse of you.\n\nSo yeah, consider this letter a declaration of my admiration for you, both on and off the field. Keep doing what you're doing, because you've definitely got a fan in me \u2013 and maybe a little more than just a fan, if you catch my drift.\n\nLooking forward to seeing you dominate the game (and maybe a few hearts) in the future.\n\nAll the best My love",

Allow 5 overseas players- It's pretty clear that the Indian domestic bowling quality isn't good enough to sustain 10 teams. Guys like Shardul Thakur, Unadkat, Mohit Sharma, Tushar Deshpande would be nowhere near an IPL gig let alone have a guaranteed place in the starting XI before this expansion.\n3. Prepare a variety of pitches- Don't make dustbowls or 300 wickets , they are fine occasionally but get tiring after a point. Make PITCHES where there is a balance between bat and ball!",

Your hair, your stance, those shots \u2013 they all make me weak in the knees.\n\nSeriously, watching you play cricket is like watching a seduction in action. The way you handle that bat... let's just say it's got my imagination running wild.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on your fitness. You're like a Greek god out there on the field, and I can't help but imagine what else you could do with all that strength and stamina.\n\nBut it's not just about the game for me. There's something about your confidence and swagger that's downright irresistible. You've got this magnetic charm that draws me in every time I see you on TV.\n\nSo here's me, putting it all out there \u2013 I've got a thing for you, JFM. Keep doing what you're doing, because you've definitely got a fan who's more than just a little bit obsessed.",

It is funny but a bit much. So, any better option appreciated. (I know BBC radio broadcasts SOME games but they don't broadcast them all, including this match.)",

Then, everything changed when the batters started doing better and hitting scores of 250+. Only the Lord, master of all four cricket elements, could stop them, but when the IPL needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years passed and Cricket fans discovered the new Lord, a youngster named Jay Shah. And although his script writing skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save the IPL. But I believe Jay Shah can save the IPL",

So all this impact player rule and pitches talk is definitely fair, the attitude of certain players also has to be considered. Teams with players like Salt, Head, JFM type players are likely to do better than teams without those kinds of players.",

To wc will only harm new players. \n\nIt will be too much of a sudden pressure",

We'll need to play some good cricket. It's nice to get past 200, every team would like to do so, but the dimensions\u00a0of this ground favours the bowlers a bit more and we've enjoyed it. No changes for us. Every player goes through a bit of time like that when you can't get runs ( asked about Padikkal's\u00a0form). He looks good in the nets and he'll have to stay positive, you saw last night when Jonny came back after getting dropped and then getting a hundred.\n\n\nHmm no Mayank",
