And let's not even get started on your fitness \u2013 I mean, have you looked in the mirror lately? *Sigh*.\n\nBut it's not just about the cricket, you know? There's something about your confidence and charisma that drives me wild. You've got that irresistible charm that makes me want to watch every match, just hoping to catch a glimpse of you.\n\nSo yeah, consider this letter a declaration of my admiration for you, both on and off the field. Keep doing what you're doing, because you've definitely got a fan in me \u2013 and maybe a little more than just a fan, if you catch my drift.\n\nLooking forward to seeing you dominate the game (and maybe a few hearts) in the future.\n\nAll the best My love",

Your hair, your stance, those shots \u2013 they all make me weak in the knees.\n\nSeriously, watching you play cricket is like watching a seduction in action. The way you handle that bat... let's just say it's got my imagination running wild.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on your fitness. You're like a Greek god out there on the field, and I can't help but imagine what else you could do with all that strength and stamina.\n\nBut it's not just about the game for me. There's something about your confidence and swagger that's downright irresistible. You've got this magnetic charm that draws me in every time I see you on TV.\n\nSo here's me, putting it all out there \u2013 I've got a thing for you, JFM.

Then, everything changed when the batters started doing better and hitting scores of 250+. Only the Lord, master of all four cricket elements, could stop them, but when the IPL needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years passed and Cricket fans discovered the new Lord, a youngster named Jay Shah. And although his script writing skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save the IPL. But I believe Jay Shah can save the IPL",
