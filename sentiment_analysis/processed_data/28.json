It's management is utter shite. \n\nVisited for the semi, dear god, the seats are uncomfortable and often dirty. They sell seats with blocked views with no prior notification. The volume of stuff you can't bring in is atrocious but more than that the behaviour of the staff - geez. They make you walk a country mile before you can enter, the food stalls hardly leave you any space to walk, the toilets are not worth entering, I can go on and on and on...\n\nKolkata is a beautiful city. Bengalis are warm and hospitable. They love their cricket. They live this game. They'd know more about Aussie players than half our population. \n\nThey deserve better than what Bengal Cricket does for them and what BCCI does for them.
