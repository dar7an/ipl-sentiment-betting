# Sentiment Analysis on IPL Betting Odds

## Introduction

This project delves into the potential of sentiment analysis to enhance betting strategies for Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket matches. By analyzing the sentiment expressed in tweets and other social media posts, I seek to uncover patterns and correlations that could provide valuable insights for informed betting decisions.


## Datasets

I would like to thank [The Odds API](https://the-odds-api.com/) for providing historical odds data and [Sportmonks](https://www.sportmonks.com/) for providing ball-by-ball match data. The project would not have been possible without their support ❤️
